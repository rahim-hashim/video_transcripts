# Noam Chomsky - Artificial Intelligence II
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [October 03, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjnGQQd3NTA)
*  So now there's a question about your view on artificial intelligence and the
*  threat or hope that it presents. When anyone asks that question the first
*  thing that comes to mind is a famous comment that was made by a great
*  biologist at MIT Jerry Lipton in a debate about artificial intelligence
*  back around 1960 and at the end of the debate he conceded that artificial
*  intelligence was pretty interesting but he said it was misnamed, should have been
*  called natural stupidity. It's a bit unfair but not totally. There's a lot of
*  hype about artificial intelligence and there are some achievements like say
*  Google Translator achievement. Robotics can make some achievements but it's
*  doing very little from a scientific point of view. It's achieving things from
*  a kind of an engineering point of view which is okay. Nobody should be opposed
*  to bigger bulldozers if they work but we shouldn't be misled about the insight
*  that it's supposed to be providing into the nature of intelligence. It's not
*  doing that. It's often some other direction. So it's a valuable pursuit
*  which can be useful. If it does insofar as it is part of science, which it is
*  partially, it's just ordinary cognitive science, an effort to try to find the
*  nature of intelligent behavior using computer-based models as a technique of
*  research. It's fine. Actually it's pretty close to the kind of work I've done all my
*  life myself. But you should be pretty cautious about evaluating the
*  PR that's associated with it which often, pretty often, is quite remote from the
*  actual level of insight obtained by these measures. Now there are also
*  threats of artificial intelligence, serious ones. That's particularly true in
*  the weapon system. If the weapon system becomes automated, we're in deep trouble.
*  Automated systems fail all the time. Any of you who have computers are familiar
*  with this. They cannot be made reliable. And unless there are very narrow
*  controls, tight controls, they can blow up. Actually I gave a couple of cases
*  when I was talking past cases. We know the US record is fairly open. The Russian
*  record is probably much worse. We don't know. But in the case of the
*  United States, there have been literally hundreds of cases when there were the
*  automated detection systems that detect an alleged missile attack just
*  gave the wrong answer, misfired. And often we were within minutes of
*  responding. Human intervention interceded. And that's going to be true pretty
*  generally. That's a serious problem. So using AI in the weapon system is
*  something extremely dangerous, as is the weapon system itself. In other areas, the
*  techniques can often be useful. The fear, the idea that say robotics are going to
*  displace working people and you know people will be out of jobs with all these
*  smart machines around, there's just no evidence for that at all. I mean if you
*  look around the country, there's a huge amount of work to be done. Take a walk in
*  any city, you know, they're all falling apart. Plenty of things to be done.
*  Education, way underfunded. Research, do vastly more. There's vast needs all over
*  the place. There are plenty of idle hands. There are resources to use those
*  idle hands to do the necessary work. But the system is so corrupt that it can't
*  put them together. That's the problem, not the fear that robots are going to
*  displace us. In fact, to the extent that dull boring work can be taken over by
*  automata, that's liberating. It frees people to do more interesting things,
*  including having leisure. The United States has much less leisure than
*  comparable countries and nothing wrong with using leisure to enrich your own
*  lives in whatever way you choose. And there's certainly nothing wrong with
*  freeing people to do more creative independent work and let the robots do
*  the boring and dangerous stuff.
