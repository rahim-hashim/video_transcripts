# Noam Chomsky - How Much Should the State Intervene in the Economy?
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [July 06, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZa8oUSgLtI)
*  Should the state intervene?
*  Personally, I don't think the state would intervene in the economy at all.
*  I think the public would intervene.
*  So that the core of traditional socialist thought, including Marxist thought, is that
*  workers should take over production, not that the state should.
*  Okay, well, and I think that's basically the right idea.
*  What I was quoting from Dewey and so on, yeah, that's the right idea.
*  But we don't live in that world, so maybe this public should intervene through this
*  government, which is the one part of the power system that is at least partially responsive
*  to the public.
*  Private power is not at all responsive.
*  Well, then it isn't a question of whether the state should intervene, but how it should
*  intervene.
*  I mean, the way it is intervening, radically.
*  In fact, the whole high-tech economy comes from government intervention.
*  Here too, you know, there's things I mentioned.
*  But that's government intervention on the principle that the public pays the costs and
*  takes the risks, and then it gets privatized for profit.
*  Well, that's one form of intervention.
*  Another form of intervention is to introduce social democratic measures, as has been done.
*  So, improving life.
*  Some people were talking about Orwell's attitude toward this.
*  I agree with it.
*  I don't think the state should intervene, but if they intervene to make life better
*  for people, okay, fine, don't object to that.
*  But it's not a question of how much, really.
*  It's a question of what should the policies be.
*  That's true right now.
*  I mean, in Europe, for example, the state authorities are intervening, say in Greece
*  or in Spain, it's coming along, with policies that enrich the bankers and harm the population.
*  Okay, that's a form of intervention.
*  There are other forms of intervention.
*  And even better would be to have the population become directly participants in controlling
*  institutions.
