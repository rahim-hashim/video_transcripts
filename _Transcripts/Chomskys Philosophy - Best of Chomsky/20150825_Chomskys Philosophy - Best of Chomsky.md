# Noam Chomsky - Advertising
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [August 25, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfIwUlY44CM)
*  The period when the press was most free was about the mid-19th century.
*  At that time, just keeping to say England and the United States, the two cases that have been studied, I imagine it's the same elsewhere.
*  In the mid-19th century, there was a very lively, popular press, very widely read by working people, by everyone,
*  that much reached far beyond the commercial media at the time.
*  It was very diverse, it represented, reflected public interest and public concerns, and it was very popular.
*  In Britain, they tried to close it down by censorship of various kinds, but that didn't work.
*  There were too many ways to avoid it.
*  It was finally understood that the way to eliminate it was by reliance on advertising and by concentration of capital.
*  Just through the effect of reliance on advertising, which was then just the beginning, around a century ago,
*  and concentration of capital, they realized that over time they could marginalize the independent, popular press,
*  which couldn't get the advertising, of course, because advertisers don't like what they were saying, and didn't have the capital.
*  And it took a long time. So in England, it was actually up until about 40 years ago, still the case 40 years ago,
*  that the main newspaper in England, the Daily Herald, was a kind of labor-oriented, social democratic newspaper,
*  very popular, everybody had outsold all the others.
*  The Mirror, which was the main tabloid, was the same, kind of leftist paper, popular paper,
*  but they kind of succumbed to advertising pressure and capital control.
*  The United States happened a bit earlier, but it was the same process.
*  And advertising is, I mean, it's part of a much bigger industry.
*  Advertising is part of the public relations industry, which is a huge industry.
*  And it developed very consciously around the First World War in the two most democratic countries,
*  England and the United States. And there's a good reason for it.
*  They were becoming, as the countries were becoming more free, that just through popular struggle,
*  and people were winning the franchise, and you couldn't shut them up anymore by force,
*  it became, it was understood that you're going to have to control people by controlling opinion and attitudes,
*  because we can't rely on force anymore. And control of opinion and attitudes means,
*  well, you know, there was actually a phrase for it.
*  This was the time when what was called scientific management of work was becoming a big issue,
*  Taylorite management, you know, for and all that stuff.
*  But it was also understood you want to not only control very closely the lives of people in their work time,
*  but also you have to control them in their off work time.
*  And what you have to do is turn them into passive, obedient consumers who don't pay, you know,
*  don't try to get out of our hair, basically.
*  Pay attention to what were called the superficial things of life, like fashionable consumption.
*  You get them trapped into consumerism, isolated from one another, atomized, control their beliefs.
*  That's where notions like manufacture of consent come from right after this First World War.
*  And out of this came huge industries.
*  And advertising is a large part of it, but and it of course affects the media enormously.
*  I mean, if any of you are, you know, if you watch television, for example, take say television.
*  When you turn on the television set, the corporation doesn't make any money, right?
*  Like they, you don't pay them when you turn it on unless it's cable.
*  But they do. So why do they do it?
*  Well, they do it because of the advertising.
*  So the resources and the creativity and the effort and so on in the whole television industry goes into advertising.
*  In fact, within the television industry, they there are words called content and fill,
*  like a program has content and a program has fill.
*  The content is the advertising.
*  The fill is the car chase that's in there to keep you watching until the next ad comes along.
*  And all the effort, of course, goes into the advertising.
*  And the fill has to, you know, first of all, it's keep your interest enough so you watch the advertising.
*  But the advertising is there for a purpose.
*  I mean, it's to make you, it's to turn people into creatures whose only concern in life is to max out their five credit cards
*  and not to pay attention to what's going on in the world and let the rich, powerful guys do what they want without interference.
