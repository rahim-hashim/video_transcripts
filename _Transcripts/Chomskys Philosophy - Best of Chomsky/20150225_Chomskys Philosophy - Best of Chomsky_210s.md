# Noam Chomsky - The Mainstream Media
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [February 25, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIG8s-e6dkM)
*  mainstream media gives essentially the same message because why well we have to
*  look what the message is first of all the message is one of of remarkable
*  subordination to power now power in the United States doesn't happen to be in
*  state it's not the it's not a centralized military bureaucratic state
*  like in the Soviet Union power in the United States primarily lies in
*  corporations in the corporate world the there there's very narrow concentration
*  of control over resources over investment decisions and so on and so
*  forth and that affects everything can't help affecting everything it it affects
*  the government because this means that there's a very close link between
*  governmental power and corporate power furthermore just the ability to make
*  investment decisions and financial decisions places bounds on what any
*  government could do yes furthermore it now let's go to the major media for what
*  are the major media well they're huge corporations okay the New York Times
*  Washington Post NBC they first of all are large corporations so they're quite
*  profitable ones in fact secondly they're parts of even bigger conglomerates like
*  you know Westinghouse and GE and so on now like any corporation they sell a
*  product on a market this is a market roughly a mark that kind of a state
*  guided market society what's the product and what's the market well the markets
*  advertisers that is other businesses so they're selling a product to other
*  businesses corporations are selling a product to other businesses what's the
*  product well the product is audiences now for the major media the ones that
*  kind of set the agenda they're selling elite audiences privileged audiences the
*  New York Times say is targeting privileged elite sectors of the
*  population that's their audience and they're trying to sell that audience to
*  other businesses not so we have to begin with just on you know the most
*  elementary grounds we have it we look at a system suppose we're Martians you know
*  we're looking at this system we say okay here are huge corporations selling
*  privileged audiences to other businesses well what picture of the world do you
*  expect to come out of that then we begin to add other factors if you're let's say
*  you're the chief diplomatic correspondent of the New York Times or
*  you know a pundit on the op-ed page and you want to really have important you
*  know insights into the government well we all know how that's done you have
*  lunch with the Secretary of State he tells you the lies that he wants to
*  appear tomorrow you write them and you say a high source in Washington my
*  intrepid reporting has discovered that a high source in Washington said so-and-so
*  in fact if you compare the internal declassified record you know say people
*  like Dean Acheson's decisions and you look at say James Reston's columns
*  they're pretty close and the same will be true about James Baker and Thomas
*  Friedman and furthermore this is an open secret we know that this is the way it's
*  it's not a big secret in the journalistic profession that this is now
*  in order to maintain those contacts you better present the world a certain way
*  or those contacts are going to be cut off you'll you'll lose your opportunity
*  to have to appear to have special insight to have leaks you know to be
*  able to come across with a story you know a couple hours before the next
*  person and so on plus you'll you'll not in order there's a there's an interplay
*  here which requires power in order to maintain your own power that's another
*  factor over and above the just structural and institutional
