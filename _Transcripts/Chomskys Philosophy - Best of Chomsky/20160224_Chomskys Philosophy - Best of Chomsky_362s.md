# Noam Chomsky - The Drone Campaign II
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [February 24, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhAS82kswcc)
*  This is the kind of question that's asked in US policy circles and academic circles all the time.
*  What can the US do to help?
*  Okay, there is something called the Hippocratic Oath.
*  It says, first do no harm.
*  When you've stopped doing harm, then you can ask the question, what can we do to help?
*  And there's a long way to go before we get to that.
*  These results that you mentioned are on the front page every day.
*  Take a look at this morning's newspapers.
*  New York Times. Lead story in the New York Times this morning.
*  It's very interesting what it tells us about the culture in which we live.
*  Americans, that is, Harvard, you know, high culture.
*  It's a discussion of the fact that the drone attacks killed,
*  inadvertently killed, an American hostage and an Italian hostage.
*  And that's a big issue because we're not supposed to kill Americans and Italians.
*  So there's a huge discussion about it.
*  What about killing the people who live there?
*  There's no question at all about that.
*  The drone campaign is the most extraordinary global terrorist campaign
*  that has ever been envisioned.
*  I mean, suppose that Iran had a campaign in which they were assassinating people
*  all over the world who they suspected might want to harm Iran.
*  So, for example, they could start with the editors of the New York Times
*  and the Washington Post who have just run articles.
*  No need to suspect.
*  They've run lead op-eds calling for the immediate bombing of Iran.
*  So we know they're planning to harm Iran.
*  So let's kill them.
*  Suppose they were doing that all over the place.
*  What would we think?
*  We wouldn't have to bother thinking because it'd be a nuclear war.
*  But when the US does it, it's fine.
*  No criticism.
*  The drone campaign officially, officially, not my words,
*  is attacking suspects, people suspected of maybe wanting to harm the United States someday.
*  Obama's meetings, you know, whatever they are,
*  Tuesday morning meetings, decide who we're going to kill today.
*  Who is on our kill list, a suspect who we think might want to harm us.
*  And this goes on without virtually no comment.
*  The only comment is about killing an American.
*  That's a problem.
*  Or what's called collateral damage.
*  When you attack a village with a drone and you kill somebody
*  and half a dozen other people standing around, they get killed too.
*  That's collateral damage.
*  And that's considered a kind of a problem.
*  So there are studies of how much collateral damage there is.
*  And that's not so good.
*  But what about killing the suspect?
*  This happens to be the 800th year of commemoration of Magna Carta.
*  Its great contribution was limited, but it established the principle of presumption of
*  innocence that a person cannot be harmed unless tried by a fair, had due process,
*  and a trial by peers.
*  Now this comes up in the discussions, in the morning's times, for example,
*  there's a claim by the US government that the suspects have due process
*  because they are considered in the executive branch of the United States government.
*  The United States government considers whether they're proper targets for assassination.
*  So that's due process.
*  That's the position of the US government, the liberal government,
*  the liberal justice department.
*  And there is no comment about this.
*  Try to find it.
*  It's just considered fine.
*  If we want to kill anyone we suspect of maybe someday harming us, why shouldn't we?
*  And this is considered really great because it doesn't put Americans at risk,
*  just kills other people.
*  So what could be better?
*  Now there is the problem that you mentioned.
*  It creates terrorists.
*  It's a terrorist generating system.
*  And that's very well known in high places, all kind of commentary about it.
*  And the reason is pretty obvious.
*  You bomb a village in Yemen, you murder some guy who may or may not be the guy you were
*  trying to kill, kill a bunch of other people across the street.
*  It inspires a desire for revenge.
*  In fact, that's one of the reasons why the United States is the most feared country in the world.
*  Things like this.
*  And we Americans are responsible for it.
*  We accept it.
*  We tolerate it.
*  It's right in the peak of the intellectual culture.
*  Harvard University, no protest about it, accepted.
*  And it does have these negative effects of generating more terrorists.
*  In fact, if you look at the terror, the so-called war on terror in the last 15 years,
*  it began in a small tribal area in Pakistan on the Afghan border.
*  It's now all over the world.
*  What we call terrorism has spread all over the world.
*  It's a wonderful success.
*  We've managed to magnify what we call terrorism, meaning what they do, not what we do,
*  all over the world.
*  West Africa, South Asia, Middle East, of course.
*  And the inability to perceive this is mind boggling.
