# Noam Chomsky - The Political Spectrum
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [December 21, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogPCxycgE80)
*  As extreme as the political spectrum is right now in the US, there's still almost complete
*  uniformity on the war on terror, the stance toward Latin America, sanctions on Iran, and
*  there's really no anti-war candidate despite popular opinion agreeing on that.
*  Why can no candidate touch that?
*  The spectrum is broad but in an odd sense.
*  The spectrum is basically from center to extreme right, extreme right, way off the spectrum.
*  So the Republican Party about 20 years ago basically abandoned any pretense of being
*  a normal political party.
*  In fact, distinguished respected conservative commentators from the American Enterprise
*  Institute, right wing think tank like Norman Ornstein described the Republican Party as
*  a radical insurgency which has abandoned parliamentary politics.
*  They just don't want anything to happen.
*  Their only policies are don't do anything or bomb.
*  That's not a political party.
*  What happened is that the party, during the whole neoliberal period, both parties shifted
*  to the right as everywhere in the world and the Republicans just went off the spectrum.
*  They became so dedicated to the interests of the extreme wealthy and powerful that they
*  couldn't get votes.
*  So they had to turn to other constituencies which are there but were never politically
*  mobilized.
*  Christian evangelicals, nativists who are afraid they're taking our country away from
*  us, people who are so terrified that they have to carry a gun into a coffee shop.
*  That's their base essentially.
*  When you look at the primaries, any candidate who has a semblance of rationality is not
*  even competing.
*  So that's the Republicans.
*  The Democrats have shifted to the right as well.
*  Today's mainstream Democrats are pretty much what used to be called moderate Republicans.
*  Somebody like Eisenhower, for example, would be considered way out on the left.
*  So for example, Eisenhower strongly made it very clear, as he put it, that anyone who
*  questions the programs of the New Deal is just not part of American political life.
*  By now that's a left-wing program.
*  It's basically Bernie Sanders' program.
*  That's Eisenhower.
*  So the spectrum just is, it's true that it's broad but in a very strange sense.
*  As far as anti-war candidates are concerned, you have to ask what it means.
*  So for example, Obama is considered an anti-war candidate.
*  He described the Iraq War as a mistake, a strategic blunder, as he put it.
*  That's like Russian generals in Afghanistan in the early 1980s who criticized the invasion
*  as a strategic blunder.
*  That's not criticism of the war, saying you're making a mistake.
*  The debate about the Obamas is running a global terror program of a kind that has never been
*  envisioned before, the drone program.
*  It's now being discussed to an extent because of recent leaks.
*  But the questions that are being raised overwhelmingly, not by Jeremy Hissgael and Glenn Greenwald,
*  but by most of those who are talking about it, is are you killing too many civilians?
*  What about just assassinating people because you think someday they might want to harm you?
*  Suppose, for example, that Iran was murdering people in the United States because they think
*  with some reason that they might want to harm them.
*  For example, the editors of the New York Times and the Washington Post
*  who publish articles, op-eds, calling for bombing of Iran.
*  So suppose they said, well, this is an imminent threat, let's kill them.
*  Would we accept that?
*  The idea that we have the right to use force and violence at will is accepted pretty much
*  across the spectrum.
