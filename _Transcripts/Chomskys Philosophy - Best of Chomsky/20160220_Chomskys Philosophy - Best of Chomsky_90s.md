# Noam Chomsky - What Do You Hope For?
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [February 20, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD3DGLJ5a3c)
*  A more free and just world.
*  In fact, right now, what I hope for is a world in which my grandchildren can have a decent life.
*  And that's not obviously going to happen.
*  There are really serious threats that might destroy that possibility.
*  The threat of nuclear war, for example, which is very serious.
*  The threat of environmental catastrophe is extremely serious.
*  In fact, there are now threats of a kind that human beings have never faced before.
*  There on the wall you can see a picture of Berkendrasse.
*  He and Albert Einstein in 1955 published a very eloquent manifesto to the people of the world.
*  And he said, people of the world have to face, make a choice that is stark and inevitable.
*  Shall we give up war or shall we destroy the species?
*  And we don't really have many other choices.
*  You could say the same about environmental catastrophe.
*  Shall we decide to do something about it or shall we create a world in which decent people wouldn't want to live?
*  Those are species-threatening choices, the kind that we've never faced before, and there are plenty of others.
