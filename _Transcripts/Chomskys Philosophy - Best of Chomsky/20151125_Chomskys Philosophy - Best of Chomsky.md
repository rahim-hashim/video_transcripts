# Noam Chomsky - Intellectuals I
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [November 25, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgzG8QiaFp4)
*  People who are called intellectuals
*  are a very curious class if you think about them.
*  So take where I teach MIT.
*  If there's a Nobel laureate in physics
*  who's working 70 hours a week in his laboratory
*  on problems of advanced physics, we
*  don't call him an intellectual.
*  If the janitor who cleans his room
*  happens to have a great deal of knowledge
*  about world affairs and a good deal of insight
*  into human life and understanding,
*  maybe more so than the people who write books.
*  We don't call him an intellectual.
*  Intellectuals are people who have a certain degree
*  of privilege, enough to be able to reach audiences,
*  and who discuss issues of general public interest.
*  So yes, they have given the privilege
*  and the opportunities.
*  They, of course, have greater responsibilities.
*  Privilege confers responsibility.
*  In fact, if you look at the history of intellectuals,
*  it's not a pretty one.
*  Overwhelmingly, intellectuals have
*  labored in the service of power.
*  The term intellectual entered modern Western usage
*  with the Dreyfus Arts.
*  And nowadays, we respect and honor the Dreyfus Arts,
*  the defenders of Dreyfus, critics of the French state.
*  It certainly wasn't true at the time.
*  They were bitterly condemned.
*  The leading, most prominent intellectuals
*  had denounced them, berated them for daring
*  to criticize state power and the Holy Army,
*  and what right did these writers, painters, and so on
*  have to talk about things they knew nothing about?
*  The respected intellectuals, the immortals
*  of the Acad√©mie Francaise, were bitterly hostile
*  to the Dreyfus Arts.
*  In fact, Emile Zola, the leading one, had to flee France.
*  That's typically the pattern.
*  And it goes back in history as far as you like.
*  Back to the earliest recorded history,
*  there were people who were approximately what we
*  would call intellectuals today.
*  So in classical Greece, one of them
*  was forced to drink the hemlock because he was corrupting
*  the youth of Athens by asking embarrassing questions
*  and challenging doctrine and dogma around the same time
*  in the biblical record.
*  There were people who were basically intellectuals.
*  They're called prophets, but that's
*  just a bad translation of a pretty obscure Hebrew word.
*  There were people who criticized the crimes of the king,
*  called for mercy and compassion for the poor and deprived,
*  presented geopolitical analysis,
*  warned of the threats that the evil kings were
*  bringing to the people.
*  So that's intellectuals.
*  What happened to them?
*  They were imprisoned.
*  They were driven into the desert.
*  They were condemned.
*  There, later, centuries later, they were honored.
*  Not at the time.
*  There were people, intellectuals, who were honored.
*  The flat earths at the court, centuries later,
*  they were called false prophets.
*  That's pretty much the pattern.
*  So for example, in the West, Czech dissidents were honored.
*  Not at home, not by the ruling authorities.
*  And conversely, intellectuals in the American domains
*  were not only not honored, they were murdered straight out.
*  So for example, a week after the fall of the Berlin Wall,
*  in the country that was the leading recipient of US
*  military aid, aside from Israel and Egypt,
*  a separate category, and had the worst human rights record.
*  That's a standard correlation.
*  El Salvador, the high command, which
*  is in close contact with the American embassy,
*  ordered a battalion of troops to invade the university
*  and murder six leading Latin American intellectuals,
*  Jesuit priests, blow their brains out,
*  and kill any witnesses who happened to be around.
*  So they also killed their housekeeper and daughter.
*  I doubt if any of you know their names, even.
*  But if anything like that had happened in Czechoslovakia,
*  I'd say, probably had a nuclear war.
*  Certainly have blaring headlines about it.
*  And you'd know their names.
*  But that's the difference.
*  In your own crimes, you ignore the crimes of your enemies
*  you love and you admire and you praise the dissidents
*  to the skies.
*  That's the pattern right through history.
*  Intellectuals don't have to do that
*  as the fringe of dissidents illustrates.
*  But that's typically what they do.
*  But apart from that, what they can do
*  is what anyone else can do, and more,
*  given the relative privilege that they have.
