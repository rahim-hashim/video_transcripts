# Noam Chomsky - Anti-politics: Hating Government, Ignoring Private Power
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [January 16, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-TydNlj7d0)
*  What has been created by this half century of massive corporate propaganda is what's called anti-politics.
*  So anything that goes wrong, you blame the government.
*  Well, okay, there's plenty to blame the government about.
*  But the government is the one institution in which that people can change.
*  It's the one institution you can affect by participation without institutional change, right?
*  That's exactly why all the anger and fear is directed against the government.
*  The government has a defect. It's potentially democratic.
*  Corporations have no defect. They're pure tyrannies.
*  So therefore you want to keep corporations invisible and focus all anger on the government.
*  So you don't like something, you know, your wages are going down, blame the government, you know.
*  Not blame the guys in the Fortune 500 because you don't read the Fortune 500, you know, thing.
*  You just read what they tell you in the newspapers.
*  So you don't read about the dazzling profits and the stupendous this and the wages going down and so on.
*  All you know is that the bad government's doing something, so let's get mad at the government.
*  The militias are just in this so-called patriot movement.
*  Notice first of all that their slogans are very much like what the whole propaganda system has been trying to ram at your heads for 50 years.
*  The government is the enemy and private power doesn't exist.
*  Okay. Now it's obvious why big corporations who are fighting the everlasting battle for the minds of men would want that to be the picture you have.
*  If the government is your enemy and you can, let's say, when people, when 83% of the population think the economic system's inherently unfair,
*  that's supposed to mean they're angry at the government.
*  If you can take that view, then those who run the private institutions are quite well off.
*  There's no threat of democracy. They can run things peacefully.
*  The people are demoralized.
*  The normal weapon, the normal methods of democratic participation to gain social ends are excluded.
*  So it makes good sense for corporate propaganda, which means most of what we see and hear,
*  makes a good sense for it to be trying to stress the message that the government is the enemy
*  and to de-stress, in fact, eliminate from sight the fact that private power exists.
*  So government is the enemy. Everybody else is in harmony.
*  You can't do anything through the political system because it's your enemy.
*  So therefore, let us, we who run the private system, let us run everything and don't bother us.
*  Anti-politics is a very scary phenomenon.
*  It can take the form that it is taking, you know, forming what shouldn't be called militias
*  because, remember, militias are things raised by states.
*  These are just private armies.
*  Forming private armies to defend the country, the people against the UN forces being brought in
*  and the black helicopters by the Council on Foreign Relations to commit genocide or whatever story you like.
*  Or else it's a fight against Lucifer and Beast 66 who's doing this, that, and the other thing.
*  And that's what, if you take a look across the country, that's what people are worried about and fighting against.
*  Aliens, you know, the devil, the UN forces, the Federal Reserve.
*  I mean, everything except what's real, namely private tyranny, private corporate power,
*  the guys who are listed in the Fortune 500.
*  Well, that's an achievement. That's a propaganda achievement.
*  And while the anger and the fear is real and it's based on something and you've got to sympathize with it because it is real.
*  When your wages have dropped 25 percent roughly in, say, 15 years and, you know,
*  your wife has to work and your kids can't eat and so on and so forth and you have no future and everything's rotten,
*  you have a lot to be angry about, but people are not focused on what's doing.
*  That's the difference between the days in which there was a live, functioning labor movement that was organizing these people.
*  Exactly these people, to work together to change things.
