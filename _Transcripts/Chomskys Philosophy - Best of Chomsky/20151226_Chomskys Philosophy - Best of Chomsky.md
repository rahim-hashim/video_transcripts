# Noam Chomsky - Freedom of Speech II
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [December 26, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwZrIEJMZmQ)
*  You're a very radical defender of free speech.
*  But what about incitement to racial hatred?
*  Do you think that this should be tolerated?
*  Do you think that given Europe's past, one should tolerate expressions of anti-Semitism?
*  Isn't that a form of insult of the dead?
*  And what do you reply to those who say, never again?
*  In Belgium, I guess, my position is considered radical.
*  In the United States, it's considered conservative.
*  I'm taking the position of the US Supreme Court.
*  How can you be more conservative than that?
*  One of the good things about the United States, it's my values.
*  And I would like to hope that it'll be other people's values, too.
*  Free speech is really protected.
*  Incidentally, that's not historically true.
*  This is another example, like slavery and homosexuality and so on.
*  There's illusions that freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Constitution, famous
*  First Amendment.
*  But if you read the First Amendment, it doesn't guarantee freedom of speech.
*  And in fact, throughout American history, it has not been interpreted as guaranteeing
*  freedom of speech.
*  In fact, the history of protection of freedom of speech in the United States is extremely
*  interesting for one reason, because it's reached the most advanced level there.
*  And it's recent.
*  The first law is basically what the courts decide, not what's written on paper.
*  And the first freedom of speech cases came to the courts in the 20th century.
*  And the famous early judgments that people hail as great progress were dissents, dissents
*  in the Supreme Court cases.
*  And first of all, and secondly, they were very weak, so the dissents still permitted
*  the kind of repression of speech that would be considered intolerable now.
*  In fact, I won't go through the details, but it wasn't until the 1960s, which is pretty
*  recent, that the courts reached a high standard of freedom of speech.
*  And it's interesting to look at the cases.
*  They're very revealing.
*  The first case involved the Civil Rights Movement, Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement.
*  In judging in their favor in a libel suit, the courts struck down a law that almost every
*  country has and that the US had, the laws of seditious libel, which make it a crime
*  to assault the state with words, basically.
*  That was struck down in 1964.
*  That means, expands the notion of freedom of speech.
*  It was defending the Civil Rights Movement.
*  The next major case, a couple of years later, was defending the Ku Klux Klan, the most
*  racist, violent, murderous organization in American history.
*  It defended them and it established an even higher standard of freedom of speech, namely
*  that speech should be free up to participation in imminent criminal action.
*  So if, say, he and I go into a store and he has a gun and we intend to rob it and I say,
*  shoot, that's not protected.
*  That's action and that's speech and participation in imminent criminal action.
*  Well, that leaves a degree of latitude, but that's the basic principle.
*  Frankly, I think that's the right principle.
*  Actually, that's a principle that was enunciated in the Enlightenment by Jeremy Bentham and
*  others and it's taken a long time to reach it.
*  In my view, that's progress.
*  That's progress as in the case of slavery, homosexuality and subjugation of women.
*  And it's virtually unique.
*  Well, I should say that this high level of protection of freedom of speech is almost
*  universally accepted with regard to ourselves.
*  So for example, not far from here, there are august institutions like United Nations General
*  Assembly and Security Council where there's constant incitement not just to racial hatred,
*  but to extreme violent action based on demonization of people and cultures.
*  In fact, there's incitement to the most extreme form of crime, namely what the Nuremberg
*  Tribunal called the supreme international crime of aggression.
*  Constant incitement to that and demonization of those necessary to create as monsters to
*  be destroyed.
*  Furthermore, that same goes on in the newspapers and in the current discourse and so on.
*  And there's no effort to try to stop that.
*  In fact, if you stopped it, you'd close down all the newspapers and academic publications.
*  It's all over them.
*  It's extreme incitement to hatred, to violence, to great crime.
*  The alleged concern about incitement to racial hatred is very narrow.
*  It does not apply to the major cases.
*  We should think about that.
*  Should incitement to racial hatred be tolerated?
*  No, it shouldn't be tolerated.
*  Nor should incitement to war be tolerated.
*  Or all sorts of other speech should not be tolerated.
*  But there's a gap, a crucial gap between not tolerating something and granting the
*  state the power to determine what speech is legitimate or even worse, to determine what
*  are historical truths.
*  I don't think we should grant the holy state the right to decide what history is and to
*  punish deviation from it and to decide what kinds of statements are legitimate and what
*  kind aren't.
*  I don't want the state to have that power.
*  So sure, don't tolerate it, but don't grant the state the right to determine what's acceptable
*  and to punish it.
*  That's a critical gap, which unfortunately is not made clear in Europe, I'm afraid.
*  What about an insult to the dead, say Holocaust denial?
*  The worst form of insult to the dead that I can think of is to adopt the principles
*  of their murders.
*  Goebbels and Stalin would be delighted with the Gaussot law in France, which is allegedly
*  trying to protect the memory of the dead.
*  It's not, it's insulting them.
*  You don't insult the memory, you don't honor the murdered victims of the Holocaust
*  by adopting Nazi doctrines.
*  That is the doctrine that the state does have the right to determine historical truth and
*  other legitimate expression to punish deviation from it.
*  Actually I just had a personal note.
*  One of my closest friends died a couple of years ago was Israel's leading civil rights
*  activist, civil and human rights activist, Israel's Shahak, who some of you may know.
*  He was a survivor of the Warsaw ghetto and Bergen-Belsen, somehow survived, made it to
*  Israel, became the leading figure in defense of human and civil rights, Palestinian rights,
*  women's rights, homosexual rights and so on.
*  He was quite respected in Israel.
*  He was selected for honors on Holocaust Day.
*  One day a year they pick the Holocaust victims.
*  His conclusion from his experiences was, yes, never again for anybody, not just for me,
*  but for anybody.
*  So that kind of thing shouldn't happen to anyone, not just to me and my friends.
*  That's the right kind of conclusion to draw, I think, from this horrible repression.
*  I don't know Belgian law, so maybe I'm wrong, but I would guess that if I stood up right
*  now and said here that King Leopold didn't kill 10 million people at the Congo, he only
*  killed 5 million, or if I said that the Belgian government didn't purposely murder Lumumba
*  and throw the Congo into total disaster, including what's happening right this minute, namely
*  the worst atrocities in the world are being carried out with the cooperation of multinational
*  corporations in eastern Congo so that you can have cell phones.
*  If I were to deny that, I doubt that I'd be brought to court.
*  You can tell me if I'm wrong.
*  I suspect that that's considered good.
*  And that's pretty serious.
*  These are some of the worst crimes in modern history, and they reach right to this minute.
*  They're going on right now while we're talking in eastern Congo, which is the worst atrocities
*  in the world, all traceable to these activities, very recent activities.
*  Well, that again illustrates, and it varies, I can give many other examples, the selectivity
*  reveals extreme hypocrisy.
*  If there was time, I would go through the very interesting history of how Holocaust
*  denial became a crime.
*  In fact, just briefly speaking, at a time when it was possible to save Holocaust victims,
*  to save survivors, there was almost no interest in doing so.
*  Explain it if you like.
*  Years later, when Holocaust victims could be exploited as justification for persecution
*  of others, then it became a big issue.
*  That's exactly what troubled people like Israel Shachar.
