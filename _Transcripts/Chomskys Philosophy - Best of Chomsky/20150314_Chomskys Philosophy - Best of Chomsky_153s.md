# Noam Chomsky on the Mondragon Cooperatives and Workers' Councils
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [March 14, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyUciVOjZP4)
*  Like take for example one of the most successful industrial commercial installations in Spain,
*  quite big in fact, Mondragon.
*  It's a big collection of industrial works, schools, you know, social systems, health
*  systems and so on, very substantial, very successful.
*  It's one of the few parts of the Spanish economy that's competitive internationally
*  even after joining European Union.
*  It's worker owned and it's partially socialist anarchist.
*  It's worker owned but manager controlled.
*  Workers pick the managers but they theoretically at least control the managers, how much they
*  control them you can debate.
*  But there's no outside investors telling them what to do.
*  They have their own banks, their own development banks, they have their own social services
*  and so on and it's been dramatically successful.
*  Well okay, that's pieces of a more free and democratic society.
*  Pieces only because workers are not really participating directly.
*  They're still picking somebody to tell them what to do, at least they're picking them
*  and they have the authority ultimately which in principle they can use.
*  Well okay, that's a piece of a democratic society and you find pieces of democratic societies
*  all over the place.
*  Very often in periods of revolution, very democratic societies emerge fast and spontaneously
*  and similarly like workers council to control industry.
*  They come up all the time.
*  I mean they come up after the Bolshevik revolution, they were immediately crushed by, actually
*  before the Bolshevik revolution, they developed and they were immediately crushed by Lenin
*  and Trotsky and Italy at the same time they developed after the Hungarian revolution they
*  developed in Spain, they not only developed but flourished.
*  In fact these things have happened over and over again spontaneously.
*  The reason is it's unnatural.
*  You don't have to read big books to think that the workers in the plant ought to get
*  together and run it.
*  In fact you go back to 19th century America, you know the mill towns around here, the workers
*  were saying factory girls as they called them, young women from the farms or you know local
*  craftsmen, the mills ought to be run by the workers who are owned and run by the workers
*  in them.
*  It's just natural.
*  That's like saying that people should vote their own representatives in Congress.
*  Well okay those natural ideas are crushed but there's no reason why they can't be realized
*  and implemented.
