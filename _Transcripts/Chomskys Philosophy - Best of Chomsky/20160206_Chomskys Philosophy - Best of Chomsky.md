# Noam Chomsky - The Institutional Framework
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [February 06, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zOsSDQTX7Q)
*  Do you incite the system that you change it?
*  By having people elected?
*  Well, you know, there's nothing wrong with it.
*  I mean, if you can get a senator who's a nice guy,
*  that's better than having a senator who's a rotten guy.
*  But there are very sharp limits on what you can do.
*  I mean, these are institutional facts.
*  I would like to say, take a corporation.
*  I suppose the chairman of Ford decided to cut back profits
*  and to use them to improve working conditions
*  and to make safer cars and, you know, put resources into,
*  you know, cars 10 years from now
*  that won't wreck the environment and so on.
*  What will happen to him?
*  Well, for one thing, he probably ought to be put in jail
*  because it's illegal.
*  He has a legal responsibility
*  to maximize profit and market share for his shareholders.
*  Well, he wouldn't be put in jail, but he'd surely be kicked out.
*  And somebody else would replace him who would do the right thing.
*  And in fact, if by some miracle he did do what he set out to do,
*  he'd be out of business in a year
*  because his competitors wouldn't be doing it,
*  so they'd be underselling him next year.
*  I mean, these are institutional facts.
*  I mean, the individuals in charge may be, you know,
*  very nice to their children and friends
*  and give a lot of money to charity,
*  but it doesn't change anything
*  because they have to act within an institutional framework
*  which requires vicious activity.
*  You're head of a corporation, you've got to be an immoral monster,
*  otherwise you can't survive as head of a corporation.
*  If you're part of a state system, you're part of the mafia.
*  And the international affairs runs like the mafia.
*  You know, it's the power systems that get away with it wherever they can.
*  The United States is more violent because it's more powerful.
*  And if Andorra had US military force, they'd be doing it.
*  That happens to be the fact about the way the world is.
*  Well, the world can change, and it has changed.
*  It's because of the popular movements.
*  You know, a lot of ferment in the 60s
*  developed much more in the 70s and the 80s.
*  They just changed the culture, and that's the way to change things.
