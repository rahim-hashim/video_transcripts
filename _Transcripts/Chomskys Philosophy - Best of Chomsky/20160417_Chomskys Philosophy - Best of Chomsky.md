# Noam Chomsky - Mathematics, Language, and Abstract Objects
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [April 17, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atupfHizJxM)
*  The British philosopher, and the British health director,
*  wrote that all the qualities die for,
*  mental, physical, abstract, and the basic source of all error
*  is to isolate one of those poles from the other.
*  What role could the conciliatory books
*  have in the history of the universe?
*  Do you see the mathematics viewed as both abstract
*  and the ability to express connectedness related to something?
*  Well, if you can hear,
*  it pointed out that Whitehead argued that things have various aspects,
*  physical, mental, abstract, and so on, and you make mistakes by confusing them.
*  The question is, to what extent mathematics,
*  the most pure abstract human language,
*  is capable of mediating these things?
*  Contemporary philosophers like Whitehead talk about the difference between physical and mental
*  as if that means something, but it doesn't mean anything,
*  and that's the Newtonian discovery. There is no notion of physical,
*  so we can't talk about the difference between physical and mental.
*  We can only talk about different aspects of the world.
*  The old concept of physical, the one in the mechanical philosophy, that's gone forever,
*  and nobody's ever invented a new one, and no scientist would even try.
*  That's the physical. Among the things there are are the mental aspects
*  of the world, like thought. What is an abstract object?
*  That's a curious notion. For example, the things that scientists
*  study are abstract objects, like somebody
*  studying planetary motion, for example.
*  A theory of planetary motion isn't concerned with asteroids
*  going by, or the effects of Alpha Centauri, or all sorts of other stuff.
*  They're studying planetary motion in abstraction from the full complexity.
*  You're always studying things in abstraction from the full complexity.
*  Actually, that's why people do experiments. The point of doing experiments is to try to
*  get rid of a lot of the complexity of the natural world that somehow you assume isn't relevant.
*  Of course, you can't do it 100 percent, because the world is always there.
*  The point of experiments is to try to get rid of as much as you can.
*  I suppose a geneticist is studying fruit flies or something. The geneticist is going to want to make those
*  fruit flies as identical as possible, and will pretend they are, in fact, identical,
*  because it's perfectly well that they aren't. But what you're doing is studying them in abstraction from a lot of their properties.
*  Everything we're studying is an abstract object. There's no way to proceed
*  in any other terms. This is sometimes called idealization, but that's a highly
*  misleading term, because idealization suggests to people that you're
*  moving away from reality, and it's the opposite. You do idealization because you're trying to get
*  away from reality. You're trying to cut away the interfering factors that keep you from
*  understanding reality, so therefore you idealize to abstract things.
*  But that's a way of finding out what reality is. It's not just this massive jump going on
*  around you. That's a useless mess. You want to understand reality. You're going to have to
*  try to find out what's going on, which means abstracting and idealizing and so on.
*  This is the core of science since Galileo, and Whitehead, of all people, should have known it.
*  He did very important work on the 17th century. So these concepts, we can't really make a lot of sense out of.
*  I think he would actually agree that he was using those words
*  to mean the same thing as they did.
*  Or now. But now they don't mean anything. I mean, now there is no physical mental distinction, because there's no physical.
*  And as far as abstraction is concerned, it's a complicated idea.
*  But there's still, I'm not saying there's nothing to the point. There is, but we have to be careful in thinking about what he meant by it.
*  He's not introducing polar distinctions of the kind that might come to mind if you don't think too hard.
*  But what about mathematics as an ideal language? Well, that's a metaphor.
*  I mean, asking to say that mathematics is a language is just a metaphoric use of the notion of language.
*  I mean, it's a little bit like saying, suppose someone were to say, look, humans can really fly.
*  In fact, at the last Olympics, they flew about 30 feet or so, which is after all not very different from chickens.
*  The championship for chicken flight, I think, is around 300 feet, one of her magnet do. No big deal.
*  So you're not going to be able to fly that high.
*  So people fly kind of like chickens and they're both very different from eagles.
*  Well, I mean, maybe some Martian didn't understand what organisms are like might say that, but it'd be a really stupid comment.
*  I mean, it's true that humans fly more or less like chickens and neither like eagles, but that's not the way it works.
*  Chickens fly like eagles and humans don't fly at all.
*  Even though they're homologous organisms, they're not like eagles.
*  And humans don't fly at all, even though they're homologous organs involved in this case, like, you know, arms are sort of homologous to wings.
*  But so to say that humans fly would be kind of like a metaphor.
*  It would be like saying submarines swim or something. You can say it if you want, but it's just metaphoric.
*  And the same is true when you say that mathematics is a language. It certainly doesn't have the properties of human language.
*  A human language is a natural phenomenon, you know, which is part of the biological world.
*  Mathematics shares some properties with it, but, you know, it doesn't have most of the properties of language and it has properties that language doesn't have.
*  Mathematics is a human creation. I mean, it's if you're a sort of a Platonist, you know, you think there really are numbers out there,
*  then which most mathematicians do, and it's not a dumb idea.
*  It's hard to think of another intelligible explanation of the fact that you can discover truths of arithmetic, but whatever that means,
*  it's not like language.
*  I mean, you use natural language in doing mathematics, but you use it in doing everything else too.
*  And when you're really doing technical mathematics, you sort of discard the natural language.
*  I mean, you may use it informally, you know, when you're talking to your students and colleagues,
*  but you mean them to understand that it's really something else, you know, and they should throw away all the connotations and so on.
*  So you can't really answer the question. I mean, mathematics is what it is, you know.
*  As to whether mathematics is a way of bringing things together, well, I think it's a question of whether it's a way of bringing things together.
*  I mean, mathematics is what it is, you know.
*  As to whether mathematics is a way of bringing things together, well, I mean, that's a question of applied mathematics.
*  How can you use mathematics in dealing with the world?
*  And the answer is that as your conception of things gets clearer and clearer, you know,
*  you can move closer and closer towards giving what we call mathematical formulations, which just mean precise formulations.
*  We call it mathematics when it's simple enough.
*  Mathematicians have, you know, kind of a special dispensation that scientists don't have.
*  They're allowed to stop working when it gets too complicated.
*  So they, in fact, it's kind of like a joke among mathematicians that the only numbers that exist are one, two, maybe three and infinity.
*  The others are just too complicated to think about.
*  And there's something to that. I mean, mathematics, you know, real mathematics is the study of extremely simple structures.
*  And sometimes the study of extremely simple structures happens to shed surprising light on the nature of the world.
*  That's when you have applied mathematics. But most of the time that doesn't happen.
*  So nobody does a mathematics of biology or something like that.
*  Because the things you understand are just way too complicated to have any interesting mathematics about.
*  You have mathematics when you start proving theorems and that sort of thing.
*  And in the case of language, I mean, you know, I've worked on it too.
*  There's a thing called mathematical linguistics, which is the study of systems that have some of the properties of language,
*  but are simplified enough so you can actually prove some theorems about them.
*  And it's of whatever interest it is. I mean, you have to look and see.
*  But it's like studying other systems that you abstract from reality and investigate because they're interesting on their own.
*  Maybe because you hope to learn something about the real world by looking at their properties.
*  But there's no other sense in which mathematics can mediate between things.
