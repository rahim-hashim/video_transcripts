# Noam Chomsky - The Atrocities in Cambodia
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [July 09, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3IUU59B6lw)
*  Your conversion to realizing that Paul Pot was a mass murderer,
*  and you've finally seen the light on that, have you Mr. Chomsky?
*  No, I've seen exactly the light that I saw at the beginning.
*  There's been a vast amount of lying on this topic, including an article,
*  which happens to be right before me in today's Daily Camera.
*  Which I wrote.
*  Which you wrote. Well, let me describe to you the...
*  Okay. Then, fine. Then let me... Okay. There's no time here.
*  You know, it takes a phrase to produce a lie and 10 minutes to decode it.
*  So I'll just take one, the one you've just mentioned.
*  Let's take the Paul Pot atrocities, okay?
*  You say here somewhere that everybody knows that Paul Pot killed 2 million people,
*  or some phrase to that extent. I feel like that.
*  Okay. Let's look at that 2 million people and what I wrote about it.
*  He killed no one according to you, right?
*  Pardon?
*  In this book by you, you say he killed...
*  Yes.
*  ...especially no one.
*  After the cataclysm.
*  You can look and check exactly what I'm saying.
*  You said it was a royal orchestrated campaign of hysteria.
*  May I finish?
*  Yes.
*  On the 2 million? Okay.
*  The figure of 2 million people killed was produced in February 1977.
*  This is all described in detail in the book by Jean Lacouture, a French journalist,
*  who was reviewing a book by a French priest named Francois Poncho,
*  which had just come out in French.
*  It was fine. About a year or two later, it was translated into English.
*  You can read it if you don't read French.
*  It was called Cambodia Year Zero.
*  That was the only book at that point by anyone who had any
*  direct or sort of plausible knowledge of what was going on in Cambodia.
*  So it was an important book.
*  It appeared in France in January 1977.
*  It was immediately reviewed in the New York Review of Books,
*  translating a review that just appeared in France.
*  Could you kind of come to a point?
*  I'll get to the point.
*  About the review and all that.
*  I told you it takes 10 minutes to decode a lie, and I'm now decoding it.
*  Okay?
*  In this review, Jean Lacouture stated that according to Poncho,
*  Palpat had killed, in fact, boasted.
*  He didn't talk about Palpat because nobody knew him then.
*  He said the Khmer Rouge have boasted, that was his word, of killing 2 million people.
*  That's where the figure of 2 million comes from that you've heard over and over again since.
*  Well, I was interested.
*  I hadn't seen figures like that.
*  And the book was not available in the United...
*  Incidentally, Lacouture's review was immediately picked up by the press,
*  quoted all over the place.
*  Oh, isn't this fantastic?
*  I'm horrifying.
*  They've killed 2 million people.
*  Incidentally, in July 1975, two years earlier,
*  the New York Times had already accused them of genocide.
*  But now we had support from Poncho, the French priest, high source,
*  says they killed 2 million people.
*  Well, I had no opinion on it one way or another.
*  So I did the obvious thing.
*  I wrote to some friends in France and asked them to mail me the book
*  because no copy of it existed in the United States.
*  It was being quoted all over the place.
*  Everybody was quoting it, but it didn't exist.
*  So I got a copy of the French book.
*  And here's what I discovered.
*  Here's the source of your 2 million figures.
*  I discovered that according to Poncho,
*  the United States was responsible for the death of 800,000 Cambodians
*  in the bombing, in the war, in the first half of the decade.
*  And then he says, according to the American Embassy,
*  the Palpatine regime is responsible for 1.2 million deaths from all causes,
*  including killing, starvation, overwork, etc.
*  Lacouture read that.
*  He added up the two figures, the alleged claim of the American Embassy
*  and Poncho's claim about the American War,
*  added them up, comes to 2 million, attributed it all to Palpatine.
*  That was the 2 million figure.
*  Well, I did the next obvious thing.
*  I wrote a personal letter to Lacouture in which I said,
*  look, I don't know what's going on in Cambodia,
*  but you misquoted Poncho.
*  I gave a series of misquotes.
*  It turns out that every reference of his to the book was a total…
*  May I interview you for a moment?
*  May I continue?
*  We have some Cambodians here in the world.
*  I will… just a second.
*  You asked me to talk about your particular lie.
*  I will now talk about it, okay?
*  If you wanted me to talk about other lies, I'll talk about them.
*  If you'll bear with me on this, it's a very illuminating story
*  about the way a system of indoctrination works
*  and about the way commissars work.
*  Let's continue.
*  Let me…
*  Cambodians and Bodhi…
*  May I continue?
*  May I continue?
*  It's plain that you don't want to hear this,
*  and I understand why, but let me continue anyway.
*  I won't take the time to go through the other lies.
*  I just mentioned that one.
*  Okay, I mentioned to Lacouture that his falsification of Poncho's book
*  was now being widely quoted, and I thought that was improper.
*  I thought he ought to report what Poncho actually said.
*  He then wrote an article which appeared in the United States,
*  in which he thanked me for calling to his attention a number of errors.
*  In fact, it turned out everything that he referred to was totally false,
*  but let's forget that.
*  And he corrected a few of them, not all, but a few.
*  In the case of the number of people killed, here's what he said.
*  He said maybe the number killed was thousands or hundreds of thousands,
*  but he said, did it really matter?
*  In other words, did it really matter whether the actual number
*  was in the thousands or in the millions?
*  No, he said, it doesn't matter.
*  It's about the same.
*  And everyone thought that was just wonderful and very heroic,
*  and after that, everyone continued to quote the two million figure.
*  Even after he had said, well, maybe it's in the thousands,
*  and of course I misquoted.
*  Now, just imagine that somebody had to say that about an American atrocity.
*  I mean, like in El Salvador, the United States is responsible
*  for 50,000 deaths in the last five years.
*  Suppose somebody came along and said, well, it's 50 million deaths,
*  or five billion deaths, a factor of a thousand.
*  Suppose somebody wrote, the United States is responsible
*  for five billion deaths, or 50 million deaths in El Salvador.
*  And then suppose somebody said, well, look, you misquoted and so on.
*  And he says, well, after all, what's a factor of a thousand?
*  I mean, we would think that that's ludicrous.
*  Of course a factor of a thousand matters.
*  It matters whether a thousandth killed is an atrocity,
*  but millions killed, in particular a boast of millions killed,
*  that's a very different atrocity.
*  Factor of a, these things didn't matter.
*  Well, you know, a factor of a hundred, a factor of a thousand,
*  all of those things matter.
*  Now, I wrote an article, and after Lacouture said
*  he didn't think it mattered, I, not I in fact,
*  but a colleague of mine named Edward Herman,
*  an economist at the University of Pennsylvania,
*  he and I wrote an article in The Nation
*  in which we gave the first actual review of Poncho's book.
*  Poncho's book is the standard source on this,
*  and we wrote the first review of it.
*  I discount Lacouture's review because everything in it was totally false.
*  The book had not yet appeared in English,
*  but we wrote a review of the book in The Nation.
*  It's June 25th, 1977, you can look it up.
*  And in it, we praised Poncho's book as serious and worth reading,
*  with its report of the grisly atrocities
*  committed by the Khmer Rouge and their barbarity.
*  And we said we have no idea what the actual numbers are,
*  how could we know, but on the basis of the actual numbers,
*  but on the basis of his book, they're probably serious.
*  And we ran through the range of, we also said we disagreed with Lacouture
*  about the question of the factor of a thousand.
*  We thought it mattered whether the number killed
*  was in the thousands or the millions.
*  Incidentally, in the same review, we also pointed out that
*  Poncho had very significantly exaggerated the atrocities
*  due to the American bombing.
*  You'll notice that nobody's minded that.
*  We have never been criticized for pointing out
*  that Poncho exaggerated the number of killings
*  due to the United States.
*  Excuse me.
*  Excuse me.
*  You think you're going to add to the list?
*  No, he's not.
*  I'll go on with the rest.
*  That was the first book that existed, and it's the major source.
*  Okay, and that's all we wrote at that time.
*  Okay, that's the basis of your first.
*  Then in the book that you're, excuse me,
*  the book that you're talking about,
*  the book that you're talking about appeared in,
*  was written in 1978, and it appeared in 1979
*  after the fall of the Pol Pot regime.
*  Written in 1978, it used more evidence up through early 1978.
*  Now, in that book, we started off by saying that
*  the Khmer Rouge are responsible for what we called
*  gruesome atrocities, and we went on to describe them.
*  But our book was not about Cambodia.
*  It was about the American propaganda system.
*  This is one chapter in a two-volume work
*  on the American propaganda system in which we compared
*  the way the other guys' atrocities are treated
*  with the way our atrocities are treated.
*  And the point that we made with two volumes of documentation
*  is that when it's the other guys' atrocities,
*  the press vastly exaggerates them and fabricates and so on.
*  And when it's our atrocities, they suppress them
*  and remain quiet about them and so on.
*  One of dozens of cases discussed is Cambodia,
*  and we pointed out this example,
*  but we also pointed out something else.
*  We pointed out that the only people who knew anything
*  about Cambodia was American intelligence.
*  Okay?
*  I mean, they actually had evidence about Cambodia.
*  They were monitoring it closely.
*  And in fact, by then, I had contacted
*  State Department Intelligence to find out what they were saying.
*  And it's given in there.
*  What they were saying, first of all, they said that
*  this claim of Poncho's about 1.2 million was an invention.
*  They had never produced any such thing.
*  And then they said, and in fact, this was said in public,
*  and we quoted in the book in mid-1977,
*  which is about the latest evidence.
*  They said that the number of people killed by—
*  they said that no doubt that they're atrocities.
*  They said it's in the tens or hundreds of thousands,
*  not from mass genocide, but from brutal overwork
*  and harsh conditions.
*  So American intelligence estimate was tens or hundreds of thousands.
*  And we cited that as well.
*  We came out with no conclusion of our own about the numbers.
*  In fact, we ended up by saying, well,
*  maybe the 2 million figure will turn out to be right,
*  even if it was totally fabricated.
*  But tentatively, we assumed that American intelligence
*  was probably right.
*  Okay?
*  Now let's turn to the last point.
*  Now there's a lot of evidence.
*  See, after the fall of the Palpat regime,
*  a lot of evidence came out.
*  I've now finished with everything I wrote about the topic,
*  which was perfectly accurate.
*  No one has ever found one minor error even.
*  There have been lies, like what you just heard, but no errors.
*  Now let's turn to another question.
*  Now let's turn to another question,
*  what the actual numbers are.
*  Well, here you can turn to subsequent scholarship.
*  It's certainly not known in detail,
*  but there is subsequent scholarship.
*  In fact, there are two major sources at the moment.
*  One of them is a book on the Palpat period
*  by the only authentic Cambodia scholar
*  who has written on the topic, Michael Vickery.
*  He's actually American.
*  In fact, he was actually in the Foreign Service.
*  He's a specialist on Cambodia, speaks Khmer,
*  his wife's family was all massacred by Palpat.
*  He worked in the refugee camps and so on,
*  and he has a book called Cambodia, 1975 to 1979,
*  in which he gives a detailed demographic study,
*  region by region, putting together whatever evidence
*  he could and so on and so forth.
*  The book was very highly praised in England
*  by Indochina scholars and so on and so forth.
*  It's never been reviewed in the United States,
*  so it was published here.
*  His conclusion is that, except in marginal journals,
*  in fact, a professor here reviewed it in the monthly review.
*  I will tell you, because this is important, that's why.
*  That's why.
*  Let me, do you want to, do you,
*  do you want to know the answer to this question or don't you?
*  You don't?
*  Okay.
*  Well, all right, let me just ask for a show of hands.
*  How many people want me to give you this answer?
*  Okay.
*  Then, the final remark, what is, what is his, what is his,
*  do you want to hear what the scholarly record shows?
*  Yes.
*  Okay.
*  What, what his estimate, his estimate, excuse me,
*  his estimate is that the total number who died above what would be expected
*  if you had had regular population growth is about 700,000.
*  There's another study by the one government
*  that carried out an official inquiry into this, the government of Finland.
*  Of course, again, never mentioned in the United States,
*  they come out with somewhat lower estimates.
*  The State Department Journal, Problems of Communism,
*  came out with a still lower estimate.
*  The leading, there are people, incidentally, who are apologists for Pol Pot.
*  The government scholar, Douglas Pike, who now heads the Indo-China Resource Center,
*  according to him, Pol Pot was, I'm quoting,
*  the charismatic leader of a peasant revolution
*  under whom the population didn't suffer anywhere near as much as they said.
*  However, I haven't said any of these things.
*  I've just reported the facts.
*  Now, why does that bother people so much?
*  Because what Herman and I did was,
*  we took the position that it is not proper to lie
*  either in suppressing the crimes of your own state
*  or exaggerating the crimes of an official enemy.
*  And of course, the commissars who insist on the right to lie are outraged by this.
*  Do you want to go on to the next slide, this one having been discussed?
