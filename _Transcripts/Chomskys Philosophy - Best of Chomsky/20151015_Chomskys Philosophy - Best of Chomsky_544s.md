# Noam Chomsky - Manufacturing Consent
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [October 15, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTBWfkE7BXU)
*  You write in manufacturing consent that it's the primary function of the mass media in the United States to mobilize public support
*  for the special interests that dominate the government and the private sector. What are those interests?
*  Well, if you want to understand the way any society works, ours or any other,
*  the first place to look is who makes, who is in a position to make the decisions that determine the way the society functions.
*  Societies differ, but in ours,
*  the major decisions over what happens in the society
*  decisions over investment and production and distribution and so on, are in the hands of a relatively concentrated
*  network of major corporations and conglomerates and investment firms and so on.
*  They are also the ones who staff the major executive positions in the government, and they're the ones who own the media,
*  and they're the ones who have to be in a position to make the decisions.
*  They have an overwhelmingly dominant role in the way life happens, you know, what's done in the society.
*  Within the economic system by law and principle they dominate.
*  The control over resources and the need to satisfy their interests imposes very sharp constraints on the political system and
*  the ideological system.
*  When you talk about manufacturing of consent, whose consent is being manufactured?
*  We can, to start with there are two different groups we can get into more detail, but at the first level of approximation, there's
*  two targets for propaganda. One is what's sometimes called the political class.
*  There's maybe 20% of the population, which is relatively educated, more or less articulate.
*  They play some kind of role in decision-making. They're supposed to sort of participate in social life, either as
*  managers or cultural managers like say teachers, writers and so on.
*  They're supposed to vote. They're supposed to play some role in the way
*  economic and political and cultural life goes on. Now their consent is crucial.
*  One group that has to be deeply indoctrinated. Then there's maybe 80% of the population
*  whose main function is to follow orders and not to think, you know, and not to pay attention to anything.
*  And they're the ones who usually pay the cost.
*  All right, Professor Chomsky, don't.
*  You outlined a model with filters that propaganda is sent through. That's a way to the public. Can you briefly outline those?
*  It's basically an institutional analysis of the major media, what we call a propaganda model.
*  We're talking primarily about the national media, those media that sort of set a general agenda that others
*  more or less adhere to, to the extent that they even pay much attention to
*  national or international affairs. Now the elite media are the sort of the agenda setting media.
*  That means the New York Times, the Washington Post, the major television channels and so on.
*  They set the general framework.
*  Local media more or less adapt to their structure.
*  This is the author of soundbikes for us in these hours.
*  I've got a minute for all the time, so that's...
*  I love this soundbikes.
*  And they do this in all sorts of ways.
*  By selection of topics, by distribution of concerns, by emphasis and framing of issues,
*  by filtering of information, by bounding of debate within certain limits.
*  45 seconds.
*  They determine, they select, they shape, they control, they restrict in order to serve the interests of
*  dominant elite groups in society.
*  There is an unusual amount of attention focused today on the five nations of Central America.
*  This is democracy's diary. Here for our instruction are triumphs and disasters.
*  The pattern of life's changing fabric. Here is great journalism, a revelation of the past,
*  a guide to the present and a clue to the future.
*  The New York Times is certainly the most important newspaper in the United States
*  and one could argue the most important newspaper in the world.
*  The New York Times plays an enormous role in shaping the perception of the current world
*  on the part of the politically active, educated classes.
*  Also, the New York Times has a special role, and I believe its editors probably feel that they bear a heavy burden
*  in the sense that the New York Times creates history.
*  What happened years ago may have a bearing on what happens tomorrow.
*  Millions of clippings are preserved in the Times Library, all indexed for instant use,
*  a priceless archive of events and the men who make them.
*  That is, history is what appears in the New York Times archives, a place where people will go
*  to find out what happened as the New York Times.
*  Therefore, it's extremely important if history is going to be shaped in an appropriate way
*  that certain things appear, certain things not appear, certain questions be asked,
*  other questions be ignored, and that issues be framed in a particular fashion.
*  Now, in whose interests is history being so shaped?
*  Well, I think that's not very difficult to answer.
*  Now, to eliminate confusion, all of this has nothing to do with liberal or conservative bias.
*  According to the propaganda model, both liberal and conservative wings of the media,
*  whatever those terms are supposed to mean, fall within the same framework of assumptions.
*  In fact, if the system functions well, it ought to have a liberal bias, or at least appear to,
*  because if it appears to have a liberal bias, that will serve to bound thought even more effectively.
*  In other words, if the press is indeed adversarial and liberal and all these bad things,
*  then how can I go beyond it?
*  They're already so extreme in their opposition to power that to go beyond it would be
*  to take off from the planet, so therefore it must be that the presuppositions that are accepted
*  in the liberal media are sacrosanct, can't go beyond them,
*  and a well-functioning system would in fact have a bias of that kind.
*  The media would then serve to say, in effect, thus far and no further.
*  We ask, what would you expect of those media on just relatively uncontroversial,
*  guided free market assumptions?
*  And when you look at them, you find a number of major factors entering into determining what their products are.
*  These are what we call the filters, so one of them, for example, is ownership. Who owns them?
*  The major agenda-setting media, after all, what are they?
*  As institutions in the society, what are they?
*  Well, in the first place, they are major corporations, in fact, huge corporations.
*  Furthermore, they're integrated with and sometimes owned by even larger corporations, conglomerates,
*  so for example, by Westinghouse, GE, and so on.
*  What I wanted to know was how specifically the elites control the media.
*  What I mean is...
*  It's like asking how do the elites control General Motors.
*  Well, why isn't that a question?
*  I mean, General Motors is an institution of the elites. They don't have to control it, they own it.
*  So what we have in the first place is major corporations, which are parts of even bigger conglomerates.
*  Now, like any other corporation, they have a product which they sell to a market.
*  The market is advertisers, that is, other businesses.
*  What keeps the media functioning is not the audience.
*  They make money from their advertisers, and remember, we're talking about the elite media,
*  so they're trying to sell a good media to the public.
*  So what you have is institutions, corporations, big corporations,
*  that are selling relatively privileged audiences to other businesses.
*  Well, what point of view would you expect to come out of this?
*  I mean, without any further assumptions.
*  I mean, the fact that they're selling to the public is not a good thing.
*  It's a good thing.
*  Well, what point of view would you expect to come out of this?
*  I mean, without any further assumptions, what you'd predict is that what comes out is a picture of the world,
*  a perception of the world, that satisfies the needs and the interests and the perceptions
*  of the sellers, the buyers, and the product.
*  Now, there are many other factors that press in the same direction.
*  If people try to enter the system who don't have that point of view,
*  they're likely to be excluded somewhere along the way.
*  After all, no institution is going to happily design a mechanism to self-destruct.
*  That's not the way institutions function.
*  So they all work to exclude or marginalize or eliminate dissenting voices
*  or alternative perspectives and so on because they're dysfunctional.
*  They're dysfunctional to the institution itself.
