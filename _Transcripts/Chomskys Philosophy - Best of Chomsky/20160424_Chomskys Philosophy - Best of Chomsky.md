# Noam Chomsky - Humanitarian Crisis
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [April 24, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V72PHRIREJY)
*  Can you give us some idea of what criteria we should use to determine what constitutes a humanitarian crisis?
*  What criteria we should use to constitute appropriate action in response to a humanitarian crisis?
*  And what criteria we should use to determine who is the appropriate agency to respond to humanitarian crisis?
*  I understand. Well, we really have to look at it on a case-by-case basis. I think it's really hard to find.
*  You can make some general statements, but the trick is to apply them to particular cases.
*  So let's look at the particular humanitarian crisis and see what we can do about it.
*  So take, say, the 1990s. There were many humanitarian crises then. One of the worst of them was in Iraq.
*  U.S. sanctions in Iraq killed hundreds of thousands of people, maybe up to a million people.
*  They strengthened Saddam Hussein. They destroyed any possibility of any uprising against Saddam.
*  They forced the population to rely on him for survival.
*  They were so horrendous that the administrators of the so-called Oil for Food program,
*  two distinguished international diplomats, Dennis Halliday and Hans van Sponek,
*  both of them resigned in protest because they regarded the sanctions they were asked to administer as genocidal.
*  Actually, just yesterday I got a letter from Hans van Sponek thanking me for having brought this up in a discussion in Oslo a couple of days ago,
*  which was about your question. So, yes, there was an easy way to end that humanitarian crisis, namely don't take part in it.
*  That's easy. It doesn't cost anything. And there are many like that.
*  One that was going on at the same time actually was in Turkey, not in the Balkans, inside NATO, not near NATO.
*  Turkey at that time was carrying out vicious atrocities, trying to suppress the Kurdish protest movement in southeastern Turkey.
*  The Kurds were deprived of the most elementary rights. They couldn't speak Turkish legally,
*  couldn't have the Turkish colors, anything. They had to pretend to be mountain Turks, as they were called.
*  And there was an uprising and Turkey launched a counterinsurgency campaign, killed tens of thousands of people,
*  destroyed about 3,500 towns and villages, drove roughly three million people, something like that,
*  out of the region. That was pretty awful. It was an easy way to stop that, namely stop participating in it.
*  The arms were coming almost entirely from the United States, about 80 percent, as the atrocities increased,
*  U.S. arms increased. In the year 1997, which incidentally is the year when Clinton was praised for the noble phase
*  of his foreign policy with the saintly glow in the New York Times, in that year, Clinton sent more arms to Turkey
*  than in the entire Cold War period combined up until the onset of the insurgency.
*  So yes, there's an easy way to stop that one, stop providing the arms. And if you like, I can run through a lot of other cases.
*  So many cases of major atrocities can very easily be stopped by stopping our participation in them.
*  And it works. One case that illustrated that is the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975,
*  authorized by the United States, supported U.S.-provided arms. Britain came in and provided, in fact, most of the arms.
*  This one was about as close to genocidal as anything in the post-war period. It was aggression and invasion and occupation.
*  It wiped out maybe a quarter of the population, a third of the population.
*  That went on right through 1999, always with strong U.S. support. The atrocities there were worse in 1999 than anything reported in Kosovo.
*  And in fact, of course, the background was incomparably worse than anything in the Balkans.
*  Finally, in September 1999, under quite a lot of domestic and international pressure,
*  Clinton quietly informed the Indonesians that the game was over. He told them, you're going to have to leave.
*  They left instantly, a day later. It could have been done for the preceding 25 years.
*  That's now called a humanitarian intervention with a level of cynicism. I don't know how to describe.
*  So, yeah, you could stop that one, too. And there are many other cases like that.
*  But those are not the kind of cases that are ever discussed.
*  The only cases that are discussed is what are the criteria when somebody else is carrying out a crime.
*  Okay, that's harder. It's much harder to stop somebody else's crimes than to stop your own.
*  And what are the criteria? Well, you know, difficult criteria.
*  You have to ask what are the purposes, what are the likely consequences, what are the general effects.
*  A lot of particular considerations have to be looked at, which are complex.
*  But I don't really... It could be an interesting question.
*  I don't think there's much point discussing it, frankly, because the question almost never arises.
*  In fact, I can't think of a case where it's arisen.
*  As I said at the very beginning, it's hard to find a case in history of a genuine humanitarian intervention,
*  one carried out for humanitarian goals and with consideration of what the consequences would be.
*  And since if the question doesn't arise, it's very hard to answer.
