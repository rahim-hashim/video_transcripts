# Noam Chomsky - Responsibility to Protect
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [December 03, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvXq6HlKV_A)
*  Responsibility to protect is a very interesting doctrine. If you look into its history, there
*  are two versions of responsibility to protect. One version was accepted by the General Assembly
*  of the United Nations, I think it was 2005, and it doesn't change existing international
*  law very much. It shifted emphasis. It said there should be a focus on whether states are
*  preserving rights internally, and if they're not, there should be various pressures, efforts to try
*  to induce them to protect and implement the kinds of rights that are, for example, exemplified in
*  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. But it very explicitly said that any state action under
*  R2P, responsibility to protect, must be in accord with the UN Charter. And the UN Charter is quite
*  explicit. It bans the threat or use of force in international affairs, with two exceptions.
*  One, under decision by the Security Council. Two, under Article 51, which permits a state to use
*  force in self-defense against armed attack, which has a definite meaning in international law,
*  until such time as the Security Council is able to respond. Okay, those are the conditions. And
*  R2P in the UN version maintains those. That's the version that the interventionist states appeal to
*  when they talk about the justifications for military intervention. But there's another version.
*  There's another, crucially, that was produced by a commission headed by the former Australian
*  Prime Minister Gareth Evans. It's the Evans Commission, which is, they presented a version
*  of R2P, which is the same as the UN version, with one exception. The exception says that in case
*  the United Nations Security Council has not acted to preserve rights, you know, to protect people,
*  organizations may, organizations of states may, in the region of their own responsibility,
*  intervene by force themselves without Security Council authorization, subject to later
*  authorization by the United Nations. Well, which organizations are capable of doing this? Exactly
*  one, NATO. Okay, so what this version says, and what is NATO's regional responsibility, the world,
*  actually that's official. As NATO expanded after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it expanded to
*  Eastern Europe, as we know, but also beyond. The official mandate for NATO, official, is that it has
*  the authority to protect the global energy system, pipelines, shipping lanes, and so on, which means
*  it can do anything it wants anywhere in the world. Okay, so there's one organization, NATO, primarily
*  the US, which under the Evans version has the right to use force unilaterally anywhere it likes
*  in the world, subject to later authorization by the United Nations. That's also called responsibility
*  to protect. So we have two versions. One, the UN version, which shifts the focus of attention,
*  but keeps the framework of international law to the Evans Commission version, which grants NATO
*  the right to do whatever it wants. One of them is the one to which appeal is made when you want to
*  talk about the justification for R2P. The other is the one that you use when you want to invade Libya,
*  or something like that. And the political science profession connives in this by failing to
*  distinguish the two different versions. And the two different versions are crucially different in
*  exactly the way you'd expect imperial powers to interpret them. That's R2P.
