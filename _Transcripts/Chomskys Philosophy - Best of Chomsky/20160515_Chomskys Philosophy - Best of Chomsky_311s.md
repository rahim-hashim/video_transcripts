# Noam Chomsky - Religion, Science, and Philosophy
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 15, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LPcTRbhB20)
*  What do you think religion is?
*  Depending what you mean by religion.
*  I mean, if you mean the Abrahamic religions.
*  We're on weak ground here because, of course, I'm religiously illiterate.
*  Okay, Judaism, Christianity, Islam.
*  Well, no, I mean, I guess, yeah, and the other such religions of that type.
*  What are those?
*  Buddhism is different.
*  Spiritual beliefs among Native Americans was different.
*  There's all kinds of religions.
*  What's the distinction that we're talking about there?
*  We're talking about the Abrahamic religion.
*  No, the following systems, Protestantism, Hindu, I guess.
*  No, the Hindus are different.
*  I mean, they're quite different.
*  Buddhism is quite different.
*  I mean, if you really look at these systems of belief, they differ a lot.
*  In fact...
*  No, but what I'm asking is what is religion per se?
*  What are the beliefs of a particular religion?
*  Beliefs that there's something in the world which is beyond my grasp,
*  which is determining the way things happen, and it's going to...
*  you know, it'll be a consolation for me.
*  Maybe, you know, if my child is dying, I'll see him again in heaven somewhere.
*  I mean, these kinds of beliefs.
*  And that there's sort of a spiritual force somewhere beyond my grasp,
*  and that explains why things are happening.
*  That's probably ubiquitous.
*  That's perfectly understandable.
*  I mean, you know, weird things are happening.
*  Like the sun is going around the earth.
*  You can see it.
*  It doesn't have to be happening, but you see it.
*  Well, something must be making it happen.
*  Okay, so it's Apollo on his chariot following the sun.
*  And the same with everything else that goes on.
*  You don't understand anything that's happening in the world in personal life.
*  And, you know, why is my child, sweet little wonderful kid, dying?
*  He didn't do anything.
*  So there's got to be some explanation somewhere.
*  So it's a set of stories to make sense of reality, except not science.
*  I mean, Apollo pulling the sun with a chariot is early science.
*  It's kind of a scientific theory, you know, it's worked out.
*  Not trivial.
*  For example, the classical Greeks did discover a lot of things.
*  But if you say it now, when there's lots of evidence other than that,
*  then it's no longer science.
*  That just means that our understanding has deepened.
*  But, you know, the transition from magic to science is a pretty smooth transition.
*  And it just, I mean, even the word science in English,
*  it didn't even appear until the mid-19th century.
*  I mean, there was a word that meant something else, just meant knowledge.
*  In the mid-19th century, there was a divorce between science and philosophy.
*  Before, it was just philosophy.
*  In fact, if you study, if you go to Oxford, let's say,
*  you can study natural philosophy and moral philosophy.
*  Natural philosophy is what we here call the natural sciences.
*  Moral philosophy is what we call the humanities.
*  But through German, you know, it's the same thing.
*  So the whole concept of science in our sense is a pretty recent one.
*  And it began, and there was an intellectual revolution, you know,
*  sort of begins with Galileo and goes on and led to enormous insights.
*  And after a while, science just kind of took off and became a special domain.
*  In the early 19th century, it was, I would take to say Kant,
*  he couldn't have told you whether he was a philosopher or a scientist.
*  He taught astronomy. I mean, he taught moral philosophy.
*  Yeah, an intelligent, educated gentleman did all those things.
*  Well, by the mid-19th century, it's becoming very hard to do all those things.
*  The sciences were reaching a point where you really understand things.
*  And you couldn't be a gentleman who knows everything.
*  So, okay, things got professionalized, and we get, you know,
*  what we call science, separate domain.
*  But recall how recent this is.
*  Prior to that, people were trying to figure things out.
*  And we might now call what they're trying to figure out magic.
*  But these are pretty smart people.
*  If you take, say, Isaac Newton, he's not a fool exactly.
*  I mean, he's now kind of, people laugh about the fact that he spent most of his life
*  working on chemistry in Church Fathers.
*  That was alchemy in Church Fathers. That was perfectly reasonable.
*  I mean, in terms of the, what are called corpuscularian theories that everybody accepted,
*  you know, the world is made up of little building blocks like bricks.
*  Shift a few.
*  Yeah, shift a few, and you get gold from lead. That makes perfect sense.
*  As for the Church Fathers, that made perfect sense too.
*  I mean, he was coming right after the humanist period,
*  when there had been a sudden discovery of the wealth and richness of classical civilizations,
*  which hadn't been known.
*  So the belief expanded that these guys really understood something.
*  And they were kind of keeping it secret for us.
*  So they were doing it in an esoteric way.
*  And if we decode what they were doing, we'll get all kinds of wonderful discoveries.
*  So it wasn't an irrational pursuit.
