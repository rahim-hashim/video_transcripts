# Noam Chomsky - The Mysteries of Nature
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [August 30, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tBI7Y4K7k)
*  So say take a look at some other organism, like say I mentioned a rat. You can teach a rat to run
*  complicated mazes, you know turn right and then turn left and turn right and left and a lot of
*  things it can do. You cannot teach a rat to run a prime number maze, a maze in which you're supposed
*  to turn right at every prime number. You can teach a human that, you know, they have to figure out the
*  prime numbers in their heads, but then they can do it. A rat can't do it with an infinite amount
*  of training. It simply does not have that concept. So it's a total mystery for rats. That's kind of
*  analogous to the fact that a human embryo can't grow wings. It's just beyond its capacity. Now
*  there are some, I think the scientifically and philosophically interesting question is,
*  what things are beyond human scope? What things are mysteries to us in the same way that a prime
*  number mazes a mystery to rats? And I think there's a very interesting record of things in the world.
*  The most simple and striking and dramatic one is interaction of objects. You go back to the medieval
*  period and the neo-scholastic period, it was assumed that there are what were called sympathies
*  and antipathies. So sympathies brought two objects together and antipathies pushed them apart. When
*  you get to Galileo and modern science begins, these notions were ridiculed. What's a sympathy
*  and antipathy? It's called an occult idea. And Galileo introduced a conception that guided
*  modern science. It's the one I quoted. The world is a machine. Everything that happens can be
*  duplicated by a skilled artist. In fact, it was created by a skilled artist. And that's what was
*  called the mechanical philosophy. Everything works like a machine. And the modern science developed
*  on the principle that unless you can show that something works like a machine, you haven't
*  explained it. So Galileo at the end of his life was kind of in despair because he had not shown
*  that the movement of the tides, let's say, or the heavenly bodies could be accounted for by
*  mechanical principles. Descartes a little bit later thought that he had shown that you could do it.
*  Leibniz had his own version. Christian Huygens had another version. But that was modern science
*  until Newton. Newton demonstrated there are no machines. Nothing works by mechanical principles.
*  He concluded that that is an absurdity, that no person with any scientific understanding could
*  possibly accept. And he was right. But it's true. That science has just had to kind of accept the
*  world is not intelligible to us. That's a major mystery. And science changed totally at that point.
*  It happened slowly. So it kind of became assimilated into common sense. But scientists no longer tried
*  to find a picture of the world that's intelligible to our intuitions. What they try to do is construct
*  theories that are intelligible. But that's a totally different topic, much lower goal. And that's
*  post-Newtonian science. Well, that's one huge mystery. But I think there are plenty of others.
*  Like, say, freedom of will. There's big debates about freedom of will. It's kind of striking that
*  everyone who participates in these debates, including the people who write learned tomes
*  showing there's no freedom of will, believe in freedom of will. Otherwise, they wouldn't write
*  the learned tomes. If we're all just thermostats of some complicated kind, then what you do is
*  determined and how people react is determined. So what's the point of the effort? So everyone
*  kind of intuitively believes it. I mean, we all believe that I can either pick this up or throw it
*  across the room or not do anything with it. But what is it? Well, it lies beyond... I think you
*  can speculate about what the core of the problem is. If you take a look at human science, there are
*  two concepts that are pretty well understood. One of them is determinacy. Something determines
*  something else. The other one is randomness. Things happen without anything determining them.
*  And that's about it, I think. Those are the basic concepts that we comprehend. And freedom of will
*  just doesn't fit in that set of concepts. Well, it could be that this is just another mystery for
*  humans. We don't have the right concept. Some Martian might be looking at us and thinking how
*  stupid we are. Why do we keep the determinacy and randomness when there's obviously that thing out
*  there that I can't point to because I'm a human? Could be. And many other things that seem imponderable
*  might turn out to be like this. I mean, once we recognize that we're not angels, we are just
*  biological organisms. And as such, we must have limits. That's just point of logic. You could not
*  have any capacities at all if you didn't have limits because the capacities determine the limits.
*  And then a question comes, well, what's beyond the limits? And we have some examples, plausible
*  examples. There may be many others. And I think that's a fertile direction to explore. Once we
*  abandon the kind of belief that we can do anything, which is a very common belief. And
*  in the modern sciences, it's very common. That's just not true.
