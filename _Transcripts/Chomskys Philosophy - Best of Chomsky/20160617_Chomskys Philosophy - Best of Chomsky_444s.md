# Noam Chomsky - Anarchism II
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [June 17, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvADXR-JEgM)
*  You've identified from a young age as an anarchist, and during that time the popularity of anarchism has fallen and risen.
*  I wonder if your core philosophy, your anarchism, has evolved or changed during the course of your life?
*  Well, it's not what it was when I was ten years old.
*  Fundamentally not, but that's because the core philosophy just seems to me like common sense.
*  I don't see how anybody can not accept it.
*  So the core principles, as far as I understand it, anarchism covers an extremely wide range.
*  You can't encapsulate it in formulas, but it seems to me there is a sort of a thread that runs through it.
*  And it is basically skepticism about any form of authority or domination or submission or whatever.
*  The idea, basic idea is that domination and hierarchy are not self-justifying.
*  They have to justify themselves. It's a burden of proof to bear.
*  And if they can't justify themselves, they should be dismantled.
*  And that covers everything from personal relations to international affairs.
*  And then out of that come various varieties of anarchism, depending on what exactly you're looking for in the future,
*  what are the alternatives to authority and so on.
*  But almost everything in decent and human life seems to me to fall under that.
*  So no, that hasn't changed.
*  Well, the tendency of anarchism, which I guess you subscribe to, anarcho-syndicalism,
*  overlaps fairly closely with council communism around this notion of worker councils.
*  And for the public at large, the assumption is that an anarchist society would be one where people ran amok, where there is chaos.
*  That's the propaganda, though.
*  Actually anarchist views are mostly of highly organized societies.
*  So what would that society look like, a society of worker councils?
*  Worker councils, I think, should be one component of it.
*  So it means in any institution, say a university or a factory or whatever it is,
*  the participants would run it through councils in which people participate and make decisions.
*  It's not unlike a faculty, which is about as close to this model as you get in our world,
*  where there are outside controls, but pretty much the faculty makes decisions about what happens internally.
*  One of the things that makes university life appealing, much more so than higher paid professions,
*  is that you're running your own life to a large extent.
*  I mean there are duties, but they're technically supposed to be shared and shared by common agreement.
*  And you may decide to work 80 hours a week, but it's the 80 hours that you pick,
*  and it's the topics that you choose to work on, and it comes out with kind of an inner need rather than external compulsion.
*  And I think that's the kind of model everything should turn towards.
*  So worker councils would be one component of a freely organized society, but they'd have to interact with others.
*  So an institution, say a factory, whatever it is, is in a community,
*  and the community should have a comparable form of self-organization and self-management,
*  and then they have to interact, and it's complex interactions because many people are parts of a lot of them.
*  And as an anarchist society, the kind that I think is desirable would develop,
*  it would have to deal with quite concrete problems about the nature of self-government, the nature of administration.
*  Do you want to distribute jobs so that they're fixed, or do you want circulation of responsibilities and actions?
*  And there's no simple answer to that. You want people to be trained as surgeons, let's say.
*  On the other hand, you don't want all the dirty work done by a special category of people.
*  So that has to be worked out, distribution of job functions and interactions between different forms of what should be voluntary association.
*  And there are many other problems, like what happens if somebody doesn't want to be part of it, take on the responsibilities of a community.
*  Those are problems that exist in any society, and they would exist in a different form, in a more free society.
*  And at this point you have lots of different ideas.
*  So there are people who are basically anarchists who think that pay, payment, what you earn from your work should be proportional to effort.
*  There are others who think that's not an appropriate model, that it should be independent of effort.
*  I tend toward the latter, but most of my friends tend toward the former.
*  But these are real questions, and they're innumerable ones.
*  Well, thinking about the road to a stateless society, an anarchist society,
*  you've written that you believe that radicals should defend those gains which have been fought for by people
*  that are embodied in the state, such as Social Security, such as progressive taxation.
*  Other anarchists might argue that this holds people within the paternalistic grip of the state.
*  Why do you come down where you do on this?
*  You have to ask what the alternatives are.
*  I mean, many anarchists just consider the state the fundamental form of oppression.
*  I think that's a mistake.
*  I mean, of the various kinds of oppressive institutions that exist, the state is among the least of them.
*  The state, at least to the extent that the society is democratic, various degrees and types,
*  but to the extent that it's democratic, you have some influence on what happens in the state.
*  You have no influence on what happens in the corporation.
*  They're real tyrannies.
*  And as long as society is largely dominated by private tyrannies, which is the worst form of oppression,
*  people just need some form of self-defense, and the state provides some form of self-defense.
*  So to say, well, let's dismantle Social Security means concretely,
*  let's decide that that disabled widow across town will starve to death.
*  I don't agree with that.
