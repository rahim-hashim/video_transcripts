# Noam Chomsky - The Beginning of Modern Science
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [June 30, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CbH0LOa-7A)
*  So since I'm ignorant I got the luck to discover Descartes.
*  I mean I knew who Descartes was but I read him after I read you
*  and I noticed he gives you the tools to doubt what he's saying.
*  It's like the opposite of dogmatism.
*  I mean that ought to be the ideal of teaching anyway.
*  Whether it's children or graduate students, they should be taught to challenge and to question
*  images that come from the Enlightenment about this.
*  It's said that teaching should not be like pouring water into a vessel.
*  It should be like laying out a string along which the student travels in his or her own way
*  and maybe even questioning whether the string's in the right place.
*  And you know, after all, that's how modern science started.
*  For thousands of years it was accepted by scientists that objects move to their natural place.
*  So a ball goes to the ground and steam goes to the sky.
*  These things are kind of like common sense and they were taken for granted for literally thousands of years from Aristotle.
*  And it wasn't until Galileo and the modern scientific revolution
*  that scientists decided to be puzzled by these obvious things.
*  And as soon as you start to question things, you see nothing like that makes any sense.
*  And every stage of science or even just serious learning comes from asking,
*  why do things work like that? Why not some other way?
*  You find that the world is a very puzzling place and if you're willing to be puzzled, you can learn.
*  If you're not willing to be puzzled and just copy down what you're told or behave the way you're taught,
*  you just become a replica of someone else's mind.
*  Some of the technical work I'm doing now is initiated by my suddenly realizing that assumptions
*  that have been standard throughout modern history of generative grammar,
*  but in fact throughout the traditional study of language, just have no basis.
*  And when we ask, OK, then why do we assume them?
*  You have to look for a basis and lots of avenues open up and that happens constantly.
*  And do you remember when you start to build your own voice or your own philosophy in a way?
*  Could you describe how this process happened?
*  It's a constant process and in any kind of scientific inquiry, any kind of rational inquiry, it's striking in science.
*  You have a conception of how things ought to work.
*  If you look at the empirical data, they're usually at least partially recalcitrant.
*  Things don't fall into place.
*  So you typically are working with a conflict between a conception of the way things ought to work
*  in terms of elegance, simplicity, naturalness, and a look at the messy way in which things do seem to work.
*  The Galilean Revolution, which was a real revolution in the way of looking at the world,
*  for one thing because of the willingness to be puzzled about what seemed to be simple things,
*  it's a hard move to make.
*  In the case I mentioned, it was 2,000 years, you know, smart people.
*  They said that nature is simple and it's the task of the scientists to show that it's simple.
*  And if we've not been able to do that, we've failed as scientists.
*  So if you find irreducible complexity you just haven't understood.
*  Well, that's a pretty good guideline.
*  And it does turn out to be a very effective driving element in inquiry.
*  Because there's good reasons why things ought to turn out to be simple.
*  I mean, for Galileo and the whole of early modern science right through Newton,
*  great scientists, you know, Huygens, others, Bernoulli, up through Newton,
*  this is the kind of classic period of modern science,
*  there was a very clear concept of intelligibility.
*  The goal of science was to show that the world is intelligible.
*  And intelligible meant something.
*  It meant something that an artisan could create, gears and levers,
*  something like a model was these, say, medieval clocks, you know,
*  which did all sorts of amazing things.
*  That goes right through Newton.
*  It's called the mechanical philosophy.
*  The philosophy just meant science.
*  So it's mechanical science.
*  And that's the goal.
*  I mean, Galileo at the end of his life was kind of distraught
*  because he was not able to construct mechanical models of the tides
*  and the motion of the planets and so on.
*  So he felt his life, scientific life, had failed.
*  But then it went on.
*  Finally he got to Newton.
*  And Newton demonstrated to his dismay that the world doesn't work like a machine,
*  that there are what his scientific colleagues called occult forces,
*  namely attraction and repulsion, which don't operate by contact.
*  So you can attract things at a distance, which was just unintelligible.
*  Newton himself thought that this was what he called an absurdity,
*  which no person with any scientific understanding could ever believe.
*  There are just inherent mysteries which are beyond our cognitive capacities.
*  Well, that was correct.
*  And that was a real shocking discovery.
*  It has now been absorbed.
*  So to talk about the current stage is misleading
*  if you're thinking about emerging fields like cognitive science,
*  because we're not in that stage.
*  We haven't got to the Galilean stage yet.
