# Noam Chomsky - Induction and Psychic Continuity
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [August 14, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbXG9rTZKNA)
*  You mentioned the problems behind the referential dogma.
*  Would you say that we are in a situation similar to Quine's indeterminacy of translation?
*  Would you say that's where we're left?
*  Well, Quine accepted the dogma, but that's not surprising because almost everybody does today, too.
*  Yeah, his doctrine of indeterminacy was in fact based on assuming this.
*  So if you take his framework that there's nothing but association and conditioning,
*  how do you know to take his example?
*  When you hear a word, let's say rabbit, when a child hears the word rabbit,
*  how does it know that the word is referring to that animal running around and not to some part of the animal?
*  Because if you see the animal running around, its leg is also running around.
*  So how does the child know that it's not the leg?
*  And how does it not know, in fact, that the word doesn't refer to some disconnected object
*  like the leg of this one and the leg of another one and so on?
*  That's a standard problem of induction. It's Hume's problem of induction.
*  And as Hume understood, but his successors don't seem to understand, there's no way to solve that problem.
*  Hume himself, contrary to what you may learn in a philosophy course, was a rationalist, not an empiricist.
*  He took for granted and says that the only way you can solve the problem of induction is by what he calls an animal instinct.
*  It means there must be some internal structure in your mind that leads you to a particular answer,
*  because there's no way to get it by induction.
*  And that, I think, is correct.
*  And I think the same could be true about Quine's Galaga, you know, rabbit.
*  The child gets the right answer because they're built to get the right answer.
*  And the right answer is not a, in the case of, say, rabbit.
*  You can easily show that what a child understands to be a rabbit is not something physically identifiable.
*  Kind of guessing your ages, but say my grandchildren probably about that age.
*  When they were kids, there's a story that they liked about a baby donkey named Sylvester.
*  And the baby donkey somehow has turned into a rock.
*  And for the rest of the story, it's trying to convince its parents that it's not a rock, it's their baby donkey.
*  And since children's stories always end happily, something happens and it ends up, and it's a baby donkey again, and everybody's happy.
*  But the interesting fact is that every child understands that that thing that has all the physical properties of a rock is in fact Sylvester.
*  And the reason is, and this was in fact noticed by John Locke, that people, and in fact animals, are individuated by properties like psychic continuity.
*  Okay, you're the same if there's some psychic continuity no matter how you change physically.
*  I mean, that's the standard fairy tale.
*  You know, the evil witch turns the handsome prince into a frog and has all the properties of a frog until the beautiful princess comes and kisses the frog.
*  Then his handsome witch has some prince again.
*  Well again, every kid knows that it's always the prince because it has the property of psychic continuity.
*  Actually a lot of science fiction is based on this, but it's even true of children's stories.
*  Well, that alone tells you right away that what individuates objects is not a collection of physical properties, but some complex mental structure that we impose on them, like psychic continuity.
*  And Hume didn't think about that, Locke in fact did, but I should say Hume recognized that it was true that we don't identify words by physical properties, but it runs across the whole collection of words.
*  You can't find a word so simple that it doesn't have those properties.
*  Actually in the natural sciences, what you try to do is to concoct, invent concepts which do have those properties.
*  So when you invent the concept, say, you know, electron or something, you intend it to be physically identifiable.
*  You don't want it to have its meaning changed by what's in your head.
*  That's the whole point.
*  So it's a kind of a norm for the sciences, but it's just not true of human language.
*  And that goes back to Quine's example.
*  The solution to his problems is essentially Hume's solution to the problem of induction.
*  No solution except you're built to pick things up, to structure the world in a certain way.
*  So that's the way to do it.
