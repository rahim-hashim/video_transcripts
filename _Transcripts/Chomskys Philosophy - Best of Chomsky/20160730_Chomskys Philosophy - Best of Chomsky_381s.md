# Noam Chomsky - Tactics, Boycott, and Nonviolent Resistance
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [July 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OVZXNKD-7c)
*  Can people take power and fight against arms trade,
*  drug trade, and so on?
*  And if so, should they do it by violence?
*  Well, just forget about principle for a moment,
*  and just think about tactics.
*  I mean, you wanna pick tactics
*  that are likely to achieve something.
*  Otherwise, it's just posturing.
*  Well, if you look for tactics that might achieve something,
*  you don't accept the battleground
*  that your opponent prefers.
*  Now, the state power prefers violence.
*  They have a monopoly of violence.
*  No matter how much violence protesters will use,
*  they'll use more.
*  That's why, say, from the 1960s,
*  when I was talking to students about activism,
*  I advised them not to wear helmets in demonstrations.
*  I mean, yes, the police are violent,
*  but if you wear a helmet, they'll just get more violent.
*  And if you come along with a rifle,
*  they'll come along with a tank.
*  You come with a tank, they'll come with a B-52.
*  It's a battle you're gonna lose.
*  And their strength is violence.
*  The strength of the opposition
*  is popular mobilization and nonviolence.
*  Actually, that's what happened in Iraq, strikingly in Iraq.
*  Of course, it's never discussed that way.
*  Governments and media and intellectuals
*  don't want you to know about the power,
*  about popular power and what can be achieved by nonviolence.
*  But if you think about in Iraq,
*  that's pretty much what happened.
*  There was violent resistance.
*  The US easily crushed it.
*  They can kill insurgents, they can level Fallujah,
*  they can destroy towns and villages.
*  No matter what it is, they have much more violence
*  at their command.
*  What they could not do was deal
*  with nonviolent demonstrations.
*  When the Ayatollah Sistani called for people
*  to come out in the streets and demand elections,
*  which the US was trying to prevent.
*  They were all the way through.
*  They wanted to prevent elections
*  to impose their own clients and so on.
*  They just couldn't respond.
*  They couldn't do anything with hundreds of thousands
*  of people in the streets.
*  So they permitted elections.
*  Then they tried to control and manipulate the elections.
*  Well, they ran into the force of Iraqi nationalism.
*  Finally, at the end, it's what I said,
*  by January 2008, they were insisting the US
*  that they have to have permanent military bases,
*  permanent right to carry out military actions
*  and control Iraq's oil resources.
*  They had to back down in the face of mass popular
*  nonviolent resistance.
*  Well, those are the tools of the weak.
*  That's what makes you strong.
*  I think that boycott is a very good idea
*  if it's properly targeted.
*  So I think it makes good sense to boycott,
*  say, American corporations or French corporations
*  that are operating in the occupied territories.
*  I mean, they're criminals and they should be blocked.
*  But what about an academic boycott?
*  You know?
*  You know?
*  And personally, I've never been in favor
*  of academic boycotts, even South Africa.
*  And in this case either,
*  let's put aside any question of principle
*  and reduce it just to the question of tactics again.
*  Now you have to, whenever you make tactical decisions,
*  you have to ask, who are you trying to help?
*  Are you trying to help yourself so that you'll feel good?
*  Are you trying to help the victims
*  so that you'll do something for them?
*  Now that leads to very different tactical choices, always.
*  In this case, suppose that the question is
*  boycotting, say, Haifa University.
*  That's a gift to the hardliners.
*  They're gonna immediately say,
*  and correctly, you're a total hypocrite.
*  Why aren't you boycotting the Sorbonne
*  or Harvard or Oxford?
*  Their countries are involved in much worse atrocities.
*  So why boycott Haifa University?
*  So it's total hypocrisy.
*  It's a gift to hardliners who can undermine
*  the content of the goal,
*  the theoretical goal of the boycott.
*  It may make the people who are doing it feel good,
*  but it's harming the Palestinians.
*  That's pretty common.
*  For example, during the Vietnam War,
*  I was rather struck by the fact that the Vietnamese
*  were strongly opposed to actions like, say, the weathermen.
*  Young kids, nice kids, I admired them,
*  I sympathized with them,
*  but their way of opposing the war was to go down the street
*  and break store windows.
*  Vietnamese were strongly opposed to that
*  because they wanna survive.
*  They don't care if American students feel good.
*  And they understood correctly that marching down the street
*  with signs and breaking store windows
*  just increases support for the war,
*  which is exactly what it did.
*  It's a tactic that, it's a feel-good tactic,
*  like I'm doing something, but it's harmful to the victims.
*  What the Vietnamese were impressed with and said so
*  is if there was a silent demonstration
*  of women at a grave, let's say,
*  that they thought was impressive
*  and it's the kind of thing you should do.
*  And it's true if your goal is to help the victims.
*  And the same is true in this case.
*  If you wanna help the Palestinians,
*  think about what the consequences of the tactics are.
*  There's also questions of principle,
*  but I've put that aside.
*  What about the consequences?
*  It's not hard to figure out.
