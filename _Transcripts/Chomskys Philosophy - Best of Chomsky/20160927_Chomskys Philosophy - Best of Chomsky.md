# Noam Chomsky - The Meaning of Life
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [September 27, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qvTvN1ni8c)
*  What is the meaning of life?
*  The meaning of life is what you make of it.
*  Life does not have any meaning apart from that for a human, a dog, a bacterium or anything else.
*  It is up to you what the meaning of your life is. So it is partially under your control.
*  If you decide your life is maximization of goods, then that is the meaning of life.
*  We can have sympathy for you, but that is what it is. If you decide that your life is friendship,
*  love, mutual aid, mutual support, a community of people who try to increase their own and other people's happiness and welfare,
*  then that is the meaning of life. But there is no external force that decides.
*  What do you think is driving the need to answer that question about the meaning of life?
*  It is probably the sense of either unwillingness or inability to take your life in your own hands.
*  If you see yourself as a creature of external forces, buffeted by a market, government, parental authority, whatever it may be,
*  then you search for something elsewhere that will tell you what the meaning of your life is.
*  If you have developed, it is a value judgment, what I think of as a healthy respect for yourself and others,
*  you will design the meaning of your life.
*  Of course, you can't do it completely. You may want to be a world champion high jumper, let us say,
*  and you may not be able to achieve that, but you can shape your life to a substantial extent and that way give it meaning.
*  In fact, discover the meaning as you proceed, you don't know in advance.
*  It is after you develop relationships that you discover their value.
*  Do you think the key would be in the relationship itself?
*  For example, in some kind of collective meaning?
*  Unless you are a hermit. If a person decides I'm going to be a hermit,
*  I'll get myself a piece of land in Montana, I'll farm it, I'll live by myself,
*  I won't pay any attention to other human beings, I'll have no form of communication with others.
*  Okay, that is the meaning of your life. I know people who have become hermits.
*  I met one climbing a mountain once. The guy was living in a mountain hut and he just wanted to be alone.
*  That is a choice you can have.
*  For most people, life means warm, supportive social relationships. But you don't know it in advance.
*  Take say marriage.
*  Suppose you get married when you are 20. You don't really know what the meaning of that relationship is.
*  You may be discovering it 60 years later. As relationships mature,
*  circumstances change, you have children, which adds a new dimension of meaning to your life that you can't imagine.
*  Or maybe it becomes sour.
*  But these are things that develop through life and at each stage.
*  If you do have the sense of self-respect and autonomy and concern for others you can, within the limits that external factors provide,
*  determine and discover the meaning of your life.
*  Discovery is not a small part of it.
