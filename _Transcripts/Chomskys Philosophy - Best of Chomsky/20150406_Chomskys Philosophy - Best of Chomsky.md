# Noam Chomsky on 9/11
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [April 06, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6I-xKr-3_Y)
*  The terrorist act, September 11, very unusual,
*  real historic event.
*  First time in history that the West received
*  the kind of attack that it carries out routinely
*  in the rest of the world, which is a historical event.
*  And naturally, the West is upset.
*  We're supposed to do it to others.
*  They're not supposed to do it to us.
*  September 11 did change policy, undoubtedly,
*  not just for the US, across the board.
*  Every government in the world saw it as an opportunity
*  to intensify their own repression atrocities
*  of whatever level they were, ranging from Russia and Chechnya
*  in the West, imposing more discipline on their populations
*  and so on, every choice in between.
*  And it had big effects.
*  For example, take, say, Iraq, going to that.
*  Prior to September 11, there is a longstanding concern
*  of the US.
*  And I'll skip Britain.
*  It's kind of ancillary.
*  Of the US to Iraq, and that is it's
*  got the second largest oil reserves in the world.
*  So one way or another, they're going to do something
*  to get it back.
*  That's clear.
*  September 11, they gave a pretext.
*  So there's a change in the rhetoric concerning Iraq
*  after September 11.
*  We now have an excuse to go ahead and do
*  what we're planning.
