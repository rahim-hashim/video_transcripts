# Noam Chomsky on Terrorism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [February 09, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWuT8d78yts)
*  First of all, when we use the term terror, we have to recognize that like most terms
*  of political discourse has two meanings.
*  There's a literal meaning and there's the doctrinal meaning.
*  In the literal meaning, terror is what's described in U.S. code of laws.
*  It's the threat or use of violence to intimidate typically against civilians, to intimidate
*  populations for political, ideological and other ends.
*  Well, nobody can use that definition because if you use that definition, it follows instantly
*  that the United States is a leading terror state, that Britain is another leading terror
*  state and so on.
*  So the literal definition, the one that's in the U.S. code of laws is unusable.
*  Then we go to the doctrinal definition, the one that's used in the media and scholarship
*  and so on.
*  It's the same as the official definition but with a qualification.
*  It only applies to what they do to us, not what we do to them.
*  That's the doctrinal meaning.
*  I'll now use it in the doctrinal sense.
*  That's totally dishonest, of course.
*  As to what to do about the threat of terror in the doctrinal sense, meaning the terror
*  by them against us, there are a lot of things to do.
*  One thing is to not increase the threat.
*  That's a simple step.
*  Don't act in order to increase the threat.
*  Now, the U.S. consistently and Britain act in order to increase the threat of terror.
*  Not because they want terror but because it's just not a high priority.
*  So take the invasion of Iraq.
*  As I mentioned, that was undertaken with the expectation since Ampley confirmed that it
*  would increase the threat of terror.
*  They expected it.
*  It happened.
*  One of the ways not to increase the threat of terror is not to take steps like that that
*  will increase it.
*  Another, and just by unanimity among specialists and intelligence agencies, a second step is
*  to try to ask what its reasons are.
*  What are the causes of it?
*  Where the causes are grievances that are legitimate grievances, something should be done about
*  those grievances, quite apart from the threat of terror.
*  That's another way to reduce it.
*  We have...
*  How would that model apply to Canada?
*  Let me get to Canada.
*  First of all, in the case of Canada, it may turn out that the motivation for the terror
*  was Canadian troops in Afghanistan.
*  You might look into that.
*  But whatever it is, if there are grievances, then something should be done.
*  Beyond that, terror is a police problem.
*  So if you find a terror is sale, if it's legitimate in Canada, then you should arrest the perpetrator
*  and they should be subjected to trial, just as the leading terrorists should be, like
*  the ones in the White House.
*  But of course, we're doing it keeping to the doctrinal sense, so it's only them against
*  us.
*  But there's more to do.
*  What should the United States do about this?
*  Well, actually, there is advice given, recommendations, in the 9-11 Commission report.
*  As you recall, there was an official government commission set up over the strong objections
*  of the Bush administration, but they finally had to agree.
*  There was a commission set up that made recommendations on how to decrease the threat of terror in
*  the United States.
*  Well, one of them had to do with Canada.
*  They concluded that a major threat of terror in the United States is the Canadian border.
*  It's a very long border, practically unprotected, very easy to cross, and they recommended that
*  there be a sharp increase in border patrols on the Canadian border.
*  That's their recommendation.
*  Well, how did the Bush administration respond?
*  It responded by reducing the growth of the border patrol altogether after 9-11 increase
*  in the border patrol reduced and shifting it from the Canadian border overwhelmingly
*  to the Mexican border.
*  Okay, so I don't remember the numbers, but I think it's about 10 to 1 by now per mile
*  of surveillance of the Mexican border and the Canadian border.
*  Well, that's so they're reducing the efforts to defend the United States from the potential
*  threat of terror from Canada.
*  Reducing that, again, another illustration of the fact that protection of the population
*  from terror is just not a high priority.
*  Okay, so for the United States, something else that could be done would be to say follow
*  the recommendations of the 9-11 Commission.
*  And there's a lot more.
*  Terror is not coming from nowhere.
*  And what you want to do is, I mean, it's easy to stand up on a pedestal and scream Islam,
*  or fascism, and so on and so forth, maybe, that makes you feel good.
*  But if you want to deal with the threat of terror, you'll ask what its sources are and
*  ask how those sources can be dealt with.
*  I mean, what we call terrorists see themselves as kind of a vanguard who are trying to organize
*  a constituency to support their long-term demands.
*  Now, their long-term demands, in the case of, say, jihadi-style terror, are pretty clear.
*  And again, there's pretty near unanimity about this in the specialist community.
*  There, as they put it, their goals are to defend Muslim lands from attack.
*  And they list specific grievances.
*  And the grievances are real.
*  They're trying to mobilize a constituency to join them.
*  Well, the way to deal, there's two ways of dealing with it.
*  One is to ally yourself with Osama bin Laden.
*  That's the way Bush picked.
*  That's why the leading terrorist specialists in the United States, like Michael Scheuer,
*  describe Bush as Osama bin Laden's leading ally.
*  Because what he's done is to do exactly what Osama wants, to help the vanguard mobilize
*  the constituency in support of terrorist acts.
*  What is recommended across the board is pay some attention to those reasons, which are real.
*  You can read that in the Defense Science Board recommendations in academic scholarship and
*  intelligence reports.
*  Pay attention to the grievances.
*  And many of them are real.
*  And they should be dealt with quite apart from the threat of terror.
*  That can reduce the threat of terror.
*  And we know that it works.
*  I mean, take, say, Northern Ireland.
*  For a long time, the British reaction to terror in Northern Ireland, which was pretty serious,
*  practically blew up the British cabinet, all sorts of things, their reaction was just to
*  increase the violence.
*  Okay, that's the Bush line.
*  You join with the terrorists and you're their ally.
*  It's exactly what the more militant sectors of the IRA wanted.
*  So you get an escalating terror and repression cycle.
*  Finally, the British got into their heads that they should pay some attention to the grievances
*  that are the source of it.
*  And in fact, they began to do so because the grievances were real.
*  The constituency was being mobilized around real grievances.
*  When they began to do that, the threat of terror declined.
*  Belfast is not utopia, but it's a very different place from, say, when my wife and I visited in
*  1993, which was a pretty scary place.
*  It's not that anymore.
*  It's much improved.
*  And in fact, the threat of IRA terror has now been very much marginalized
*  by doing the sensible thing, paying attention to the source out of which it grows.
