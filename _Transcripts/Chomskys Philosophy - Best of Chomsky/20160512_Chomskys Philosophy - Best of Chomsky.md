# Noam Chomsky - Engendering Terrorism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 12, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CopTcKk9DUM)
*  Well, there's great concern in the West and elsewhere about the rise of terrorism and
*  what we can do to limit this scourge, and that's quite appropriate.
*  There are some simple answers.
*  So one way to sharply reduce global terrorism is to stop carrying it out.
*  That's the easiest way, and that would already have a big effect.
*  We don't have to keep this abstract.
*  The most extreme global terrorism campaign now underway is President Obama's global assassination
*  campaign.
*  That's sheer terror.
*  Drone attacks terrorize populations.
*  They murder suspects, not people shown to be guilty, but suspects, others who may be
*  unfortunate enough to be nearby.
*  They traumatize communities, terrorize tribal societies.
*  They also engender terrorism, which is well understood at the highest sources.
*  You carry out a drone attack on a village in southern Yemen, killing somebody you don't
*  like and maybe lots of others, and you create a desire for revenge and reaction.
*  That's engendering terrorism probably faster than they're killing people they don't like.
*  That's one example, hardly the only one.
*  If you take a look at major acts of terror, probably the single greatest terrorist act
*  was the 9-11 destruction.
*  Ask yourself who did it.
*  It was mostly tribesmen from Yemen who had been subjected to bitter persecution and were
*  dedicated to revenge.
*  That's the way you engender terrorism.
*  Carrying it out consistently just expands it.
*  Of course, that's only a small part of it.
*  Western terrorism, just under Ronald Reagan, was extensive in Central America, Southern
*  Africa.
*  He was the last supporter of apartheid and the atrocities of the apartheid regime at
*  home and abroad.
*  At least, these are massive operations of violence and aggression and often terror.
*  There's a very good reason for the world to be deeply concerned about them.
