# Noam Chomsky - Universal Grammar II
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [September 24, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb36gnu-0rA)
*  How have your ideas on universal grammar changed over the years?
*  Are you more or less convinced of the theory now than you were initially?
*  Well there's a lot of confusion about the notion universal grammar.
*  Universal grammar had a traditional meaning, but in modern linguistics, the last 50 years
*  or so, it's had a technical meaning, which is not unrelated to the traditional meaning,
*  but it's not identical either.
*  Universal grammar is just the name for the theory of the genetic component of the language
*  faculty.
*  I mean, transparently, there's some genetic component, right?
*  There's a reason, say, why my granddaughter reflexively identified some part of her environment
*  as language-related, which is no small trick.
*  Nobody knows how to duplicate that.
*  And then more or less reflexively picked up the capacity that we're all now using.
*  Whereas her pet, say, kitten or chimpanzee or songboard bird or whatever it may be, with
*  exactly the same inputs, couldn't even take the first step, can't identify part of the
*  environment as language-related, obviously not the later steps.
*  Well there are two possible answers to how that happens.
*  One is it's a miracle.
*  The other is she has some specific genetic capacity that's like the capacity that had
*  her grow arms and not wings, let's say.
*  Just some fixed, or had a mammalian visual system, but not an insect visual system.
*  This is not controversial for anything except human higher mental faculties.
*  For some reason, when people investigate human higher mental faculties, they have to be in
*  insane.
*  You can't accept the approach that we take to everything else in the world.
*  They're kind of a methodological dualism.
*  Everything else in the world we study by the standard methods of science, but when we talk
*  about human higher mental faculties, we have to become mystics.
*  So therefore there's a controversy about the existence of universal grammar, which means
*  a controversy about whether there is some genetic property that distinguishes humans
*  from everybody else, which leads to the ability to do what we're now doing.
*  But there shouldn't be any controversy about that.
*  The only question is what is it?
*  Well there have been theories about it from the 1950s when these studies began up till
*  the present, and it's a living field, so they keep changing.
*  So in that sense, yes, my views about universal grammar keep changing, say when Anne walked
*  into my office as a graduate student and told me I was wrong about everything, I said,
*  okay, my views changed.
*  But in that sense, sure, there's going to be constant change until the field disappears
*  or is dead or something.
*  And there's a long way to go.
*  These are not trivial questions.
*  The sort of general tendency of change, not every linguist would agree by any means, so
*  it's a personal opinion.
*  In the early stages, when the first question was asked seriously about 50 years ago as
*  to how we are capable of doing what we do all the time, how are we capable of understanding,
*  producing expressions which we've never heard, which may have never been uttered in the history
*  of the language and do it over infinite range, very strange properties that they have as
*  soon as you look at them, how can we do it?
*  The only answer seemed to be that each of us has a highly intricate computational system
*  in the brain which yields these very specific results.
*  But that then poses a paradox because it must be the case that we all, all humans, have
*  the same genetic capacity with marginal variation.
*  The reason is if you take a child from, say, a hunter-gatherer tribe in the Amazon and
*  the child is raised in Cambridge, Mass, it'll become a graduate student studying quantum
*  physics at MIT with no difference from anyone else, and conversely.
*  So we all have the same capacity.
*  And it's more or less understood why.
*  The capacity developed very recently in evolutionary time, probably in some window between 100,000
*  and 50,000 years ago, something like that.
*  And that's just a flick of an eye.
*  So whatever happened never changed except extremely marginally.
*  So we're all fundamentally identical for all practical purposes.
*  Human genetic variation is very slight anyway, superficial differences but not very profound.
*  If we were an outside, say, an extraterrestrial observer looking at us the way we look at
*  frogs, we'd say there's only one human and one language with minor variations.
*  So on the one hand, it's got to be uniform.
*  On the other hand, it seemed to be the case that each particular language had a highly
*  intricate and complex system of rules, computational system, and they were very different from
*  one another.
*  And that is a paradox, in fact, a serious paradox.
*  Well, over the years, there have been efforts to deal with it, to try to overcome the paradox.
*  A major step was taken, and here views on universal grammar, at least for many of us,
*  did change radically, was around 1980.
*  You were there, yeah.
*  It's her fault.
*  There's been a different view of the matter, sort of crystallized, what's sometimes called
*  the principles and parameters view.
*  The picture that there are fixed principles which are really invariant.
*  Nobody has to acquire them.
*  They're part of universal grammar.
*  And then there's a number of options that can be taken, called parameters, that the
*  child has to pick up from experience.
*  And they have to be pretty simple.
*  You have to be able to pick them up from limited evidence, because that's all there is.
*  So for example, in some languages, like English, it's called a head-first language.
*  So the verb precedes the object, and a preposition precedes the object of the preposition, and
*  so on.
*  Other languages, like, say, Japanese, are almost the mirror image.
*  The verb follows the object, the post position is not prepositions, and so on.
*  So the languages are virtually mirror images of each other, and you have to set the parameter.
*  The child has to set the parameter, which says, am I talking English or am I talking
*  Japanese?
*  And that can be determined from very simple data.
*  So that's a reasonable choice of a parameter.
*  And the hope was that you could find some finite set of parameters, like a finite switch
*  box, where you set the switch, the child has set switches one way or another, and can do
*  it on the basis of fairly simple data.
*  And then once this enters into a predetermined system of principles, you get things which
*  superficially look very different, but are actually almost identical, just differing
*  in superficial choices.
*  Well, if you could work that out, you'd have solved the paradox.
*  It's a long way to work that out.
*  But that made it possible, at least, to confront the issue seriously without facing an immediate
*  near self-contradiction.
*  And it set off a lot of a really rich period of research and inquiry, and nothing like
*  it in the thousands of years of history of study of language in the last 25, 30 years,
*  of a wide variety of typologically different languages, new questions at a depth that could
*  never have been proposed before, sometimes answers leading to new questions and so on.
*  It's been a very lively period.
*  And it also raised another question.
*  What about the principles?
*  Where do they come from?
*  And in fact, the choice of parameters.
*  Where do these things come from?
*  If they're in universal grammar, if they're part of the genetic endowment, then they had
*  to evolve somehow.
*  But not a lot could have evolved, because it's too recent.
*  You go back 100,000 years, there's, as far as we know, nothing.
*  Humans had the same anatomy.
*  Anything that's preserved in the fossil record is about the same, hundreds of thousands of
*  years back.
*  So some small change must have taken place in the brain, which somehow allowed all of
*  this to suddenly blossom.
*  And pretty soon after that, again, in evolutionary time, like maybe a couple of tens of thousands
*  of years, which is no time at all, humans started leaving East Africa, where we all
*  come from, as far as anyone knows.
*  So some small group developed this system and then spread all over the world.
*  Now they're all essentially the same.
*  But what evolved in that short period of time cannot have been very complex.
*  You wouldn't expect a series of extensive stages, like say, development of limbs, millions
*  of years.
*  Therefore, what you'd predict is that some other principle external to language, maybe
*  some principle of nature, a principle of computational efficiency or something like that, which is
*  not specific to language, interacted with a small mutation, which just gave rise to
*  the universal grammar.
*  Well, that sets forth a new goal of research to ask to see if you can determine that the
*  principles themselves do not have the intricacy that they appeared to have, but are actually
*  the result of application of non-linguistic, in fact, maybe non-human principles, like
*  general principles of computational efficiency, to whatever small change took place.
*  And the small change was probably the capacity to carry out recursive enumeration, basically
*  the capacity that gives you the number system, for example, to take two things, two objects
*  already constructed in the mind and make up a new object out of them, and then keep that
*  process up indefinitely so you get an infinite array of possible expressions, each with
*  some semantic interpretation and some mode of externalization, speech, sign, whatever
*  it may be.
*  That would be, and the goal would be to try to show that that was essentially instantaneous
*  once the small mutation took place, given this recursive enumeration operation that
*  allows you to create a discrete infinity of structured expressions.
*  Well, that's at least a feasible picture.
*  The trick is to show that it's true, or how close it is to true.
*  Can you cut away at the apparent complexity of the principles and show that they can actually
*  be accounted for in terms of general principles that hold for organisms generally, perhaps,
*  and maybe even elsewhere in the physical world, and that are instantly or almost instantly
*  applied once the original move is made to whatever small move it was to produce the
*  capacity for recursive enumeration?
*  Well, that's a goal.
*  It's far from being attained, but in the last 15, 20 years, there's been considerable
*  progress towards it.
*  That is, a lot of things that it seemed 20 years ago you had to assign to the genetic
*  endowment have now been rather plausibly shown to be possible consequences of just application,
*  particularly of principles of computational efficiency to a system which had only the
*  ability to construct an infinite hierarchy of expressions.
*  We don't know enough about the brain to know how that might have happened, but that could
*  have been a very small mutation, just changing something in somebody's genome and then spreading
*  through the small breeding group.
*  In that respect, it's a goal, and steps have been taken towards it, but you would expect
*  something like that ought to be true, just from what's known about the history of evolution
*  of homo sapiens in very recent times without much opportunity for selection to have had
*  any effect, maybe a small effect, but not much.
*  So that's, I think, that's the tendency of thinking, at least my thinking and some other,
*  many others, on how theories of universal grammar have changed.
*  But the idea that there is universal grammar that exists, that can't be controversial unless
*  you believe in magic, for the elementary reasons that I mentioned.
