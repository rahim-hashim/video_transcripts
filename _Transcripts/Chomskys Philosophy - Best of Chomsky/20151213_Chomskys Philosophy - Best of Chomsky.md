# Noam Chomsky - Intellectuals II
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [December 13, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huMUGm5z6RE)
*  Everyone has to line up and sing the hosannas to our leaders.
*  That's the job of intellectuals.
*  Round up the chorus so they all sing praises to your leaders while they march in the parade
*  and tell you how magnificent we are.
*  That's the historic task of intellectuals.
*  Not just here. It's a historic task.
*  Let's go back, say, to World War I, far enough away so we can think about it.
*  What did intellectuals do during World War I?
*  Well, the first thing that happened is 93 leading German intellectuals published a manifesto
*  calling on their colleagues and the rest of the world to support Germany and its magnificent aim
*  to bring justice and peace to the world.
*  What did the West, the European American intellectuals do?
*  Exactly the same thing.
*  In fact, they all lauded the magnificence of their own leaders.
*  There were some exceptions.
*  Most of them ended up in jail on both sides.
*  So in Germany, Rosa Luxemburg and Carl Liebknecht objected and were in jail.
*  In England, Bertrand Russell objected. He was in jail.
*  In the United States, Eugene Debs is the leading figure in US labor in the 20th century,
*  a socialist presidential candidate.
*  He went to jail for raising mild questions about Woodrow Wilson's war.
*  And others were just repressed, like Randolph Bourne was kicked out of all of his journals and so on,
*  because they didn't join the parade.
*  And intellectuals are supposed to join the parade. And they do.
*  Exceptions are so rare, you can practically list them.
*  There are exceptions, and there are honorable ones.
*  Actually, most of them are in the Third World. I'll give you quite a few.
*  But in the West, most intellectuals are very loyal and submissive.
*  And what you're hearing is not, don't talk about motivations, because they're very selective.
*  As I say, Wall Street Journal is okay. Current History is okay.
*  The Yale University volume on Age of Terror is okay.
*  It's critics who are not allowed to raise motivations, because critics are not allowed to exist.
*  So therefore, they're not allowed to do what other people do, or in fact, do anything.
*  They have to join the parade.
*  We've passed the point where you throw them into jail in the West, but you try to get rid of them in other ways.
*  By vilification, by lies, by defamation, you know, the various techniques that intellectuals know very well.
*  It's part of their, you know, metier.
*  So that's what you're hearing. And you can see that you're hearing that by the selectivity.
*  So we don't have to bother with the argument, because it's idiotic.
*  Of course, if you're serious, you're going to try to find out the motivation of the Nazis, too.
*  I mean, anybody who's serious about Nazism, of course, is going to ask about the motivation.
*  I mean, it's not even a question. Is that justification of them? Of course not.
*  It's just elementary rationality.
