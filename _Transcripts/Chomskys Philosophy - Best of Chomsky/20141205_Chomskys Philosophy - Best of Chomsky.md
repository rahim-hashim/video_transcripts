# Noam Chomsky on Adam Smith
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [December 05, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1GF_o7Fj0M)
*  Adam Smith is very rarely read. He's worshipped but not read. So for example, everyone's heard of the phrase invisible hand
*  But almost no one knows how he used it
*  And the term invisible hand actually does appear in his classic wealth of nations once
*  It appears in an argument against what's now called neoliberalism
*  Classical what's now called neoclassical economics that we're supposed to worship
*  So we're supposed to worship Adam Smith and neoclassical economics and that radically differ on the notion invisible hand
*  Adam Smith was concerned as David Ricardo later was
*  that if there was free movement of capital and
*  free import of goods
*  He was concerned about England. He said England will suffer
*  because British capitalists will invest abroad and
*  And they'll import from abroad and that'll harm the English economy Ricardo had similar concerns
*  And Adam Smith then gave an argument was not a very good argument, but his argument was that
*  English investors will prefer to invest in England
*  Because of what some called a home bias
*  They'll have a preference for investing close by and therefore as if by an invisible hand
*  England will be saved from the menace of free capital movement and the free imports that's invisible hand
*  What's that got to do with?
*  the Cato Institute or the or the modern enthusiasm about free capital flow and
*  You know having
*  US corporations
*  Invest in China so they can send stuff back here to sell cheap exploiting Chinese workers. That's not Adam Smith
*  And it goes right across the board. I mean everyone who went to college
*  Learned the first paragraph of wealth of nations in which he talks about how wonderful division of labor is, you know
*  files for all kind of efficiency and productivity and so on and not very many people got to page
*  You know, whatever it is page 400 in which he points out that division of labor is monstrous
*  Because it turns people into creatures as stupid and ignorant as a person can possibly be
*  it's a person who just becomes a machine and that's a
*  Terrible attack on fundamental human rights and therefore he says in any civilized society
*  The government is going to have to intervene to prevent division of labor
*  How many people get that far?
*  In fact Smith does give arguments for markets rather nuanced arguments
*  I'm going to just take what they call trade. You know, the so-called conservatives are very excited that trade is increasing
*  so for example NAFTA is supposed to be a great triumph of conservatism it
*  Increased trade between Mexico and the United States. Well, it it's true that cross-border interactions
*  Between Mexico and the United States increased
*  But would Adam Smith or any classical liberal or traditional conservative have called that trade? I mean suppose General Motors
*  assembles parts in Indiana and sends them to Illinois for
*  Assembly and then to New York to sell is that trade?
*  Well, let's suppose happens across the Mexican border, but it's still internal to a huge command economy
*  Is that trade? Well, it turns out that if you look at the rough figures, which are all that we have
*  before and after
*  the
*  part of
*  cross-border interactions between
*  Mexico and the US that was
*  Internal to a corporation was about 50% and now it's about two-thirds
*  that's no more trade than if the Kremlin
*  produced things in
*  Leningrad and sent them to Ukraine for assembly and the Poland to sell that just operations internal to command economies
*  We have just simply you know, they just even to talk about trade or free trade or
*  entrepreneurial values or consumer choice or democratic functioning and so on is putting us in a world of illusion and fantasy
*  That's why these terms are all demeaned not just conservative
