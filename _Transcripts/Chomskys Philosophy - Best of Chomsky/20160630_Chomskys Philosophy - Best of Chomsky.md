# Noam Chomsky - Hume's Paradox
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [June 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF8DsIVWDcs)
*  all kind of authoritarian structures in the world, they all ought to be challenged.
*  Very few of them can resist that challenge. They survive mainly because they're not challenged.
*  They're not really very strong. They look strong, but there's a point that was made by David Hume
*  a couple hundred years ago, which is worth bearing in mind. He raised a kind of paradox of power.
*  He said, how does power sustain itself? He said, if you think about it, power is always in the hands
*  of the people who are oppressed. It's in the hands of the governed. They really have power.
*  And he says this is true of the most oppressive society, what we would call totalitarian society,
*  as of the most free. Power is in the hands of the governed, so how come they submit themselves
*  to the authority of others? He said, well, force is an element, but he said the real element is
*  opinion. You have to control their opinion. Of course, he was in favor of it. He's a Tory.
*  So he says, well, what you have to do is make sure you control the opinion of the people,
*  meaning make them believe, you know, make them saturate their minds with ideology, carry out
*  what we call propaganda. Didn't have that term in those days. And control their opinion and you got
*  them. That means you change their aspirations, you restrict their aspirations to personal things,
*  to commodities, to break down the natural bonds among people, force them to forget what they
*  understand, you know, that they basically want freedom and independence and justice and so on.
*  Every child understands that. So you have to work really hard to drive it out of their heads.
*  And if you can drive it out of their heads and you control their opinion, then they'll submit,
*  you know, and they'll submit whether you're a brutal state or a more free society. In fact,
*  it's more important in the free societies in the 20th century. When it be, you know, in Hume's day,
*  there wasn't much difference. Every society was absolutist. But as the societies differentiated
*  over the years with popular struggles and winning the franchise and so on and so forth,
*  the difference between the freer societies and the more, you know, totalitarian or command societies
*  became clearer. And a point was began to be understood that Hume didn't talk about. And that
*  is that control of opinion is much more important than the free societies. So if I can say Soviet
*  Russia, they didn't really care much what people thought. Franco Spain, let's say, you know,
*  fascist state, people read much more broadly and widely than they do in the United States.
*  I would like to say, I mean, it's true, you know, you go to a Marxist bookstore, you know, I mean,
*  if you got out of line too much, okay, they send you to the torture chamber in downtown Madrid. But
*  the since there were techniques of control, just by force, there was not much, you know,
*  wasn't much concern about what people thought. It's sort of believe what you like, we'll beat you
*  over the head with a bludgeon, you know, when you get to the freer societies, there's a lot more
*  concern with what people think. And that has been understood. That's part of the reason for the rise
*  of the public relations industry in the United States. Public relations industry is propaganda
*  agency of business, which was it's an American creation, you know, it was created in the early
*  part of the century, to try to, as they put it in to control people's minds. And that's, you know,
*  I don't know if they read Hume, but you know, it's not a deep point, anybody can understand it
*  without reading Hume. They understood that unless you control people's minds, we're going to be in
*  trouble. People's mind, you know, the what's called in the business press, the greatest hazard
*  facing industrialists is the rising political power of the masses. I'm quoting, I mean,
*  he recognized that the business press is very Marxist, super Marxist. And all the values are
*  inverted, you know, but they believe in class struggle, they talk about the masses, you know,
*  and beating down the masses and all that sort of thing. In fact, business press reads kind of like
*  Maoist tract, little red books and things just with all the values reversed. And they understood
*  that you've got to control people's opinion because as Hume put it, power is in the hands
*  of the governed, if they ever realize it. And if they realize it, and they try to recognize what
*  their own values are and pursue them, we're really going to be in trouble, because there's not going
*  to be any way to control people.
