# Noam Chomsky - Greed
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [April 21, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_4Rmb2wvJ4)
*  One of the leading political scientists, Martin Gillens, came out for the study of the relation
*  between public attitudes and public policy.
*  What he shows is that about 70% of the population has no way of influencing policy.
*  They might as well be in some other country.
*  And the population knows it.
*  What it's led to is a population that's angry, frustrated, hates institutions.
*  It's not acting constructively to try to respond to this.
*  There is popular mobilization and activism, but in very self-destructive directions.
*  It's taking the form of unfocused anger, attacks on one another, and on vulnerable
*  targets.
*  That happens in cases like this.
*  It is corrosive of social relations, but that's the point.
*  The point is to make people hate and fear each other and look out only for themselves
*  and don't do anything for anyone else.
*  One place you see it strikingly is on April 15th.
*  April 15th is kind of a measure, the day you pay your taxes, of how democratic a society
*  is.
*  If a society is really democratic, April 15th would be a day of celebration.
*  It's a day when the population gets together, decides to fund the programs and activities
*  that they have formulated and agreed upon.
*  What could be better than that?
*  So you should celebrate it.
*  It's not the way it is in the United States.
*  It's a day of mourning.
*  It's a day in which some alien power, you know, has nothing to do with you, is coming
*  down to steal your hard-earned money and you do everything you can to keep them from doing
*  it.
*  Well, that is kind of a measure of the extent to which, at least in popular consciousness,
*  democracy is actually functioning.
*  Not a very attractive picture.
*  The tendencies that we've been describing within American society, unless they're reversed,
*  it's going to be an extremely ugly society.
*  I mean, a society that's based on Adam Smith's vile maxim, you know, all for myself, nothing
*  for anyone else.
*  A society in which normal human instincts and emotion of sympathy, solidarity, mutual
*  support, in which they're kind of like driven out.
*  That's a society so ugly, I don't even know who would want to live in it.
*  I wouldn't want my children to.
*  If the society is based on control by private wealth, it will reflect the values that it
*  in fact does reflect.
*  The value that is greed and the desire to maximize personal gain at the expense of others.
*  Now any society, maybe a small society based on that principle is ugly, but it can survive.
*  A global society based on that principle is headed for massive destruction.
