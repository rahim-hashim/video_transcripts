# Noam Chomsky - Communication and Language
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 21, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAm8ee_fooI)
*  It's another dogma that language and communication are about the same thing.
*  But if you think about it, it's extremely implausible.
*  For one thing, almost any behavior you carry out communicates something.
*  Gesture, hairstyle, almost anything.
*  So sure, language behavior also communicates something.
*  Beyond that, almost all language is not involved in communication.
*  And we all know that.
*  I mean, you can't go one minute without talking to yourself.
*  I mean, it takes a tremendous effort of will not to be
*  doing whatever you're doing when what's going on in your head.
*  Well, that's plainly not communication.
*  You're doing it yourself.
*  That's about 99.9% of the use of language.
*  Now, in fact, when you really think, it's never been investigated.
*  But if you introspect about it, it could be investigated seriously,
*  from kind of third person point of view, but it hasn't been.
*  So you can only sort of think about it yourself.
*  But I can only tell you my introspections.
*  You can figure out yours.
*  But my introspections are that when I am thinking in language,
*  it's not really language.
*  There's just like an occasional wordal flittle on and
*  I know what I want to say.
*  And then I can express it somehow, sometimes, either internally or externally.
*  But if it's the same for you, then that suggests that there's some kind of
*  language use going on in there that isn't even using the articulated language system.
*  And it's just kind of hovering in there somewhere.
*  Occasionally, bits and pieces come out and if you try,
*  you can say them to yourself or say them outside.
*  And you know when you get it right, which means that you must have meant something.
*  And the articulation that you produce can match what you meant.
*  But what you meant is in some internal language.
*  And furthermore, even if you look at the part of language,
*  very small part, that's external, like what we're doing.
*  A very small part of that is communication in a serious sense.
*  A lot of it is just setting up social religions, telling jokes to your friends,
*  passing time.
*  It's not communication in a meaningful sense of the word communication.
*  So I think it's just a big mistake to identify communication with language.
