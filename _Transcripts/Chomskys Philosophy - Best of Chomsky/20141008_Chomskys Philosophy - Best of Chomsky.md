# Noam Chomsky on Religion
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [October 08, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ51k8EiKh0)
*  Thank you for joining us.
*  Would you or do you consider yourself a person of faith?
*  I try not to have faith.
*  I believe in a principle that was enunciated rather well by Bertrand Russell, which is
*  that you should try to keep away from having irrational beliefs.
*  You should believe some things for which you can find some evidence or some support apart
*  from commitment to principles like equality and freedom and justice and so on.
*  Those I wouldn't say that's faith.
*  Those are things you're committed to.
*  But as far as beliefs about the world, reality, my feeling is one should try to as much as
*  possible have substantiated beliefs or at least beliefs for which evidence could be
*  appropriate.
*  Well then, would you consider yourself paradoxically a person who has faith in the scientific method?
*  I think it's the only method we have to try to get some approximate understanding of the
*  world.
*  I don't have faith that it will reach the truth or even that it's leading us in the
*  true direction.
*  In fact, as someone committed to the scientific method, I'm also committed to its consequences.
*  And among them are that you and I and the rest of the species are organic creatures
*  who have their specific capacities and limitations.
*  And we simply don't know and have no reason to believe that these capacities are such
*  that we can gain the truth about the world.
*  We do our best, but that's the most we can do.
*  But people would say that you cannot have moral principles unless you adhere to a faith
*  If I attribute those principles to a divine creature who I define as ordering me to have
*  those principles, the principles don't become any more better established.
*  So that's a useless step.
*  It's true that our moral principles are not firmly grounded in unshakable evidence and
*  argument, but nothing is going to make them any more firmly grounded.
*  As for having a meaningful life, it seems to me irrelevant.
*  People who have meaningful lives with faith and without faith.
*  Do you think holding a supernatural worldview is healthy and beneficial for humanity?
*  It's not for me.
*  I don't see any point to it at all.
*  On the other hand, I know that it means religious beliefs and other forms of supernaturalism
*  happen to mean a lot to a lot of people.
*  If I find someone who's mourning the loss of a dead child and is comforted by the idea
*  that they'll be reunited with the child in heaven, it's not my business to try to convince
*  them that their belief is incorrect.
*  In fact, in a way, I think they're lucky to be able to have such a belief.
*  I don't have it and I don't think in the long run it's healthy.
*  We can't legislate to other people what they should believe in order to say comfort themselves.
*  What in general do you feel then about religion's role in human society, both historically and
*  here in the 21st century?
*  Overall, I think in terms of its effect on policy, ranging from social policy to war,
*  I think it's been mostly negative.
*  In fact, often extremely negative.
*  With regard to individuals, it varies.
*  For a lot of people, it just means a lot and always has.
*  What do you attribute to that?
*  Do you think there's something biological, like many people have argued, that we're sort
*  of hardwired for religion?
*  Do you think that religion is sort of keeping in lockstep with evolutionary processes?
*  First of all, we know very little about the evolution of humans in any relevant respect.
*  I mean, we know a lot about the fossil record and so on.
*  But when you get to human cognitive capacities and so on, what we call sometimes higher metal
*  faculties, the evolutionary record is just extremely thin.
*  We're a very recent product of evolution.
*  Modern humans from a cognitive perspective, cognitive behavioral perspective, only emerged
*  within roughly the last 100,000 years, which is like a flick of an eye in evolutionary
*  time.
*  And we're all more or less identical.
*  There's very little genetic variation among relevant, genetic variation among humans because
*  there's been, we probably come from a small breeding group somewhere in East Africa, probably
*  no later than say 50,000 years ago.
*  There's no time for anything to have happened.
*  And to see, in a sense, it's like almost in my view, virtually a tautology to say that
*  the commitment to religious belief is the result of evolution because we're the result
*  of evolution, just like my chin is, my toenails are.
*  So so are my higher metal faculties.
*  But that just doesn't tell you very much.
*  I mean, we all know without playing, kind of doing pop science, that people do want
*  to find ways to give an intelligible picture of the universe around them, to find comfort,
*  to find association with others.
*  And they do it in all kinds of ways.
*  Some of them we call religion, a lot of some of them we call magic.
*  In modern, in the modern period, period of the rise of organized modern science, of course,
*  goes way back, but really as a major phenomenon in human life, there's been a concerted attempt
*  to explain, to gain an understanding of the world by means that do permit confirmation,
*  disconfirmation, building on the results of others and so on, as we call science.
*  Okay, we should push that as far as we can.
*  Surely we want to understand as much as we can about the world
*  and that's the best way to understand it.
