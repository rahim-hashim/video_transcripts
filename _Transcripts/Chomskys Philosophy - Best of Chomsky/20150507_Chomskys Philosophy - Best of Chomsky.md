# Noam Chomsky - Becoming a Political Activist
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 07, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikCgqzekFqM)
*  You were already established, you were a professor at MIT, you had made a reputation, you had
*  a terrific career ahead of you, you decided to become a political activist.
*  Now, here is a classic case of somebody whom the institution does not seem to have filtered
*  out.
*  I mean, you were a good boy up until then, were you?
*  Well, you'd always been a slight, sometimes you were a rebel.
*  Yeah, pretty much.
*  I had been pretty much outside.
*  You felt isolated.
*  You felt out of sympathy with the prevailing currents of American life, but a lot of people
*  do that.
*  Suddenly in 1964, you decide, I have to do something about this.
*  What made you do that?
*  Well, that was a very conscious decision and a very uncomfortable decision because I knew
*  what the consequences would be.
*  I was in a very favorable position.
*  I had the kind of work I liked.
*  We had a lively, exciting department, the field was going well, personal life was fine,
*  I was living in a nice place, children growing up, everything looked perfect, and I knew
*  I was giving it up.
*  And at that time, remember, it was not just giving talks, I began involved right away
*  in resistance.
*  And I expected to spend years in jail and came very close to it.
*  In fact, my wife went back to graduate school in part because we assumed she was going to
*  have to support the children.
*  These were the expectations.
*  And I recognized that if I returned to these interests, which were the dominant interests
*  of my own youth, life would become very uncomfortable.
*  Because I know that in the United States, you don't get sent to a psychiatric prison
*  and they don't send a death squad after you and so on.
*  But there are definite penalties for breaking the rules.
*  So these were real decisions.
*  And it simply seemed at that point that it was just hopelessly immoral not to.
*  I'm Noam Chomsky, I'm on the faculty at MIT, and I've been getting more and more heavily
*  involved in anti-war activities for the last few years.
*  Beginning with writing articles and making speeches and speaking to congressmen and that
*  sort of thing, and gradually getting involved more and more directly in resistance activities
*  of various sorts.
*  I've come to the feeling myself that the most effective form of political action that
*  is open to a responsible and concerned citizen at the moment is action that really involves
*  direct resistance, refusal to take part in what I think are war crimes, to raise the
*  domestic cost of American aggression overseas through non-participation and support for
*  those who are refusing to take part, in particular draft resistance throughout the country.
*  I think that we can see quite clearly some very, very serious defects and flaws in our
*  society, our level of culture, our institutions, which are going to have to be corrected by
*  operating outside of the framework that is commonly accepted.
*  I think we're going to have to find new ways of political action.
*  You say the war is simply an obscenity, a depraved act by weak and miserable men.
*  Including all of us, including myself, including every... that's the next sentence.
*  Yeah.
*  Same sentence.
*  Sure, sure, sure, because you count everybody in the company of the guilty.
*  I think that's true in this case.
*  Yeah, but this is a sense of theological observation, isn't it?
*  No, I don't think so.
*  Because as somebody points out, if everybody's guilty of everything, then nobody's guilty
*  of anything.
*  No, I don't believe that.
*  See, I think the point that I'm trying to make, and I think ought to be made, is that
*  the real... at least to me, I say this elsewhere in the book, what seems to me a very, in a
*  sense, terrifying aspect of our society and other societies is the equanimity and the
*  detachment with which sane, reasonable, sensible people can observe such events.
*  I think that's more terrifying than the occasional Hitler or LeMay or other that crops up.
*  These people would not be able to operate were it not for this apathy and equanimity.
*  Therefore I think that it's, in some sense, the sane and reasonable and tolerant people
*  who share a very serious burden of guilt that they very easily throw on the shoulders of
*  others who seem more extreme and more violent.
