# Noam Chomsky - Postmodernism and Post-structuralism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [August 18, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3cm0OCA4So)
*  Are the trends you've been speaking about in US universities, do you think they're responsible for a lot of what's coming out of the academic collapse, mainly postmodernism?
*  Do you think that has a particular place in the doctrinal system, mainly people wanting to be subversive but not rock the boat, or do you think there's some other explanation for that?
*  Well, you know, individuals have their own reasons and you have to look and ask why they're doing things.
*  But if you look at the phenomena as a whole, its effect has been, I think the effect is pretty clear, it allows people to take a very radical stance, you know, more radical than thou,
*  but to be completely dissociated from anything that's happening for many reasons. One reason is nobody can understand a word they're saying, so they're already dissociated.
*  It's kind of like a private lingo, and it's very, you know, there's a lot of material reward that comes from it.
*  Like if you're part of that system, you can run around the conferences and get big professorships and, you know, all this kind of stuff.
*  So there's a lot of sort of conventional material reward, and it has this very radical look to it, so you feel, you know, every...
*  Well, let me just give you an example. I gave a talk a couple days last Saturday, last Saturday, at Pierszate University, you know, the Palestinian University at the West Bank,
*  and it was, you know, like everywhere, big mass audience, political talk, mostly criticizing the Palestinian authority, because I was in, you know, you always tell people what they don't want to hear,
*  so I want to criticize Israel, I do it on the other side of the border. But the... And the audience, most of the audience, you know, very supportive, and they liked it and they understood it.
*  The guys with the jackets and ties were pretty angry, but that's normal. However, as I left with an Arab friend of mine who organized it, he's actually an Arab, he's an Israeli Arab,
*  he's a member of the Knesset Parliament, but an old kind of good guy. He sort of... He was sitting in the back of the... As we walked out, he kind of laughed, and he told me that, you know,
*  he said most of the especially younger people liked it a lot, but he heard one critical, really critical comment from a young woman faculty member who sort of liked the general political thrust of it,
*  and he told him it was very naive. And I said, you know, why was it naive? And he laughed, and he said, well, it's because you said that people do things on moral grounds and you talked about truth, okay?
*  And that's old fashioned nonsense, you know, that's kind of this old enlightenment stuff. We know perfectly well that nobody does it. I mean, I talked about how apartheid was overthrown, you know,
*  how it was necessary to have splits inside the white society, which there were. If the white society had been unified, they would have smashed the ANC. But there were splits from the inside and basically on moral grounds.
*  People didn't want to tolerate it, and that was quite important. Somebody, you know, talked about that. Well, that's naive because nobody does anything on moral grounds. All power plays, you know, read Foucault and so on and so forth,
*  if you can understand it. And truth is kind of like an old fashioned concept, you know, there's no truth and so on and so forth. Yeah, that stuff goes on all over.
*  I mean, the next day I gave a talk at an Israeli university, and then it was critical of Israel and the United States and talk about the Palestinians. And there were commentators, and one of the commentators was the dean,
*  and, you know, he hated it, of course, and historian. And he said, he also said it was naive because I was talking as if there's, there's an objectivity in history. I was running through the history of what happened and saying how you should interpret what's going on now in those terms.
*  It is complete naive. I mean, everybody knows there's no objectivity and there's no truth and it's this narrative and that narrative and so on and so forth. That's very convenient. It sounds very radical, you know, and it's extremely convenient.
*  You can beat people over the head with perfect, you know, self-confidence because there's no reality anyway. And it's just their narrative and your narrative. In the third world, it has, it's particularly grotesque in my opinion. It's bad enough here.
*  I don't like it here or other rich countries. But when you get to third world countries, it's really grotesque because the, you know, they're the separation of the radical intelligentsia from popular struggle is much more, you know, it shows much more dramatically.
*  I mean, people are much poorer and they're suffering much more. And these guys are usually pretty, pretty very rich in fact often. And it's ugly. But I think it has served a function. I don't want to say that the people who are involved in it necessarily do it for this reason.
*  In fact, I know extremely good people who are very active and I respect and like and so on who are right in this stuff. I don't know why, but that's there means something to them. But as a general phenomenon, I think that's the way it's worked.
*  It's worked as a way of insulating sectors of a kind of radical intelligentsia from popular movements and actual activism and serving as and it served as an instrument of power.
*  I think I suspect that's the reason why it's so readily tolerated in the universities. It's all over the place in the third world as well because of the function it serves.
*  I have to say there's a lot of postmodern work I just don't understand so I can't comment on it. That seems to me some exercise by intellectuals who are talking to each other in very obscure ways and I can't follow it and I don't know if anybody else can.
*  Postmodern views of science by and large have been pretty embarrassing I think. There's some interesting work on this. There's a book by two physicists, Jean Broukman and Alan Soquel. Both of them happen to be political radicals just running through.
*  It's mostly Paris postmodernism, what postmodern commentators have said about science and it is really embarrassing to the extent you can understand it. On the other hand there is a point.
*  There is a point. Insofar as they say that everything that people do is some kind of social construction. It depends on the historical context, cultural context. I don't know if you need the whole postmodern baggage to say those things.
*  My feeling is not, at least personally I haven't seen anything that doesn't seem to be, has to be said in anything but monosyllables. Insofar as I understand it, it's pretty straightforward. I get the feeling that it's kind of, there isn't a drive among intellectuals to make things look difficult.
*  It's a kind of self-protection. I mean if what I'm doing can be done by the guy who is repairing my furnace, okay then who am I? And then there's those physicists over there who talk complicated things and have to, I don't understand them so I'd like to be like them. That drive is clearly there. I think it should be resisted. We can say things simply so that people can understand them.
*  Like anything that we understand about at all with regard to things as complicated as human affairs, the answers are pretty trivial. If they're not trivial we don't understand it. There is a category of intellectuals who are undoubtedly perfectly sincere.
*  If you look at it from the outside what they're actually doing is using polysyllabic words and complicated constructions which apparently they seem to understand because they talk to each other. Most of the time I can't understand what they're talking about.
*  And even people are supposed to be in my field. And it's all very inflated and a lot of prestige and so on. It has a terrible effect in the third world. In the first world, the rich countries, it doesn't really matter that much. So if a lot of nonsense goes on in the Paris cafes or the Yale comparative literature department, well okay.
*  On the other hand, in the third world, popular movements really need serious intellectuals to participate. And if they're all ranting of postmodern absurdities, well they're gone. I mean I've seen real examples. So there is that category.
*  And it's considered very left wing and very advanced and so on and so forth. Well some of what appears in it actually makes sense. But when you reproduce it in monosyllables, it turns out to be truisms.
*  So yes, it is perfectly true that if you look at scientists in the West, they're mostly men. It's perfectly true that women have had a hard time breaking into the scientific fields. And it's perfectly true that there are institutional factors determining how science proceeds that reflect power structures.
*  I mean all of this can be described literally in monosyllables. And it turns out to be truisms. On the other hand, you don't get to be a respected intellectual by presenting truisms in monosyllables.
*  Now a lot of the left criticism, so when the left so-called left, I don't consider it left, when the left criticism so-called happens to be accurate, well okay that's fine. So if you point out a lot of things, just like what I mentioned, there are a lot of, no that's fine.
*  Point it out, everybody can understand it. Take a look, you see it's true and so on. On the other hand, a lot of the so-called left criticism seems to be pure nonsense. In fact, that's been demonstrated conclusively.
*  So there's a very important book by Jean Briquand, Alan Soquel, I forget what it's called, Dangerous Solutions or something, where they simply go through the, they happen to concentrate on Paris, which is the center of the rut, but it's all over.
*  And they go through the most respected French intellectuals and run through what they say about science. And you know, it is so embarrassing that you kind of cringe when you read it, actually sometimes.
*  One of my most striking ones is one of the very few who actually is a scientist and knows something about science, Latour has a background in science and philosophy of science.
*  They go through an article of his, and I think I'm remembering correctly, in which he, somebody in France or somewhere had discovered that one of the pharaohs had died of tuberculosis.
*  And they did it by analysis of whatever, DNA or something. Latour wrote an article ridiculing this, because it's totally absurd.
*  Because nobody had talked about it.
*  Yeah, tuberculosis was only discovered in the 19th century, and everything's a social construction.
*  And therefore it wasn't constructed yet.
*  So it didn't happen. I mean, you know, it's kind of at the level of Bush and Shurak, but it's taken very seriously. This is considered very leftist.
*  But one point to look at, I think, is that the description of intellectuals, the description of journalists, and now the description of this sector, a part of what calls itself the left.
*  You have something similar going on, even though the price is much lower.
*  You have those guys sitting in the air-conditioned rooms bombing the hell out of the world for their careers, for their status, because of their reflexive lessons that they've learned.
*  And then over here you have people who are in literary criticism or whatever field they might be in, who are also completely divorced from reality or obscuring it or dolling it up for similar reasons.
*  Of course, the price is much less. I mean, it's high, but it's still not like bombing the world. But it's the same phenomenon.
*  It's hard to understand. I mean, they're nice people, a lot of them are friends. If you look at what's happening, I think it's pretty easy to figure out what's going on.
*  I mean, suppose you're a literary scholar at some elite university or anthropologist or whatever.
*  I mean, if you do your work seriously, that's fine. But it's not very... I mean, you don't get any big prizes for it.
*  On the other hand, you take a look over in the rest of the university and you've got these guys in the physics department and the math department.
*  And they have all kinds of complicated theories, which of course we can't understand, but they seem to understand them.
*  And they have principles and they deduce complicated things from the principles and they do experiments and they find either they work or they don't work.
*  And that's really impressive stuff. So I want to be like that too. So I want to have a theory in the humanities, literary criticism, anthropology and so on.
*  There's a field called theory. We're just like the physicists. They talk incomprehensibly. We can talk incomprehensibly. They have big words. We'll have big words.
*  They draw far-reaching conclusions. We'll draw far-reaching conclusions. We're just as prestigious as they are.
*  Now, if they say, well, look, we're doing real science and you guys aren't, that's white, male, sexist, bourgeois, whatever the answer is.
*  How are we any different from them? Okay, that's appealing. And there are other things that went on.
*  Remember that a lot of this stuff comes from Paris. And interesting things were happening in Paris in the 1970s.
*  The French intellectuals were the last group of intellectuals in the world who were dedicated overwhelmingly, not 100 percent, but it was very standard and respected to be a dedicated Stalinist and Maoist.
*  Okay, by the mid-70s, I was getting to be a pretty hard position to uphold.
*  So what you had, if you take a look at what happened is there was a sudden shift.
*  People who had been flaming Maoists and Stalinists suddenly became the first people in the world to have discovered the gulag.
*  And went on a tear about how everyone else supports Stalinist and Maoist atrocities.
*  And we're France, of course, so we have to be in front of everyone. So therefore we've exposed it.
*  And now we're open. This was called the new philosophy, the new philosophy or something.
*  And it went over all kinds. I remember meeting, I won't mention names because it's embarrassing, one of the leading French cultural theorists who happened to go to Paris.
*  One of the theorists who happened to visit me around 1974. And she was a flaming Maoist.
*  A couple of years later she was one of the first people who understood to have discovered the Stalinist and Maoist atrocities.
*  Well, okay, when you went through that transition, you've got to do something else. How are you going to be on the front pages?
*  Okay. Along comes the invention of post-structuralism.
