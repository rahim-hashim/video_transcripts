# Noam Chomsky on States and Popular Movements
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [February 07, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEeY-_3hgOU)
*  What state does function according to what you call the minimal levels of honesty?
*  None. States are power centers. The only thing that imposes constraints on them is either outside force or their own populations.
*  Internal criticism, critical dialogue.
*  That's exactly why the intellectuals who we're talking about are so adamant at preventing people in the United States and Britain from learning the most elementary facts about themselves.
*  It's impossible that if you say no state functions, like no nations...
*  It's not only possible, it happens. The United States, for example, is far more civilized than it was 40 years ago. Let's just take that.
*  This March happened to be the 40th anniversary of the public announcement by the Kennedy administration that the U.S. Air Force is bombing South Vietnam.
*  It also initiated chemical warfare to destroy crops, initiated napalm, started driving millions of people into concentration camps to separate them from the guerrillas they knew they were supporting.
*  This was all public. Did we commemorate the 40th anniversary? No. Why? Because 40 years ago, nobody cared.
*  If the government announces, okay, we're going to start bombing another country and use chemical warfare to wipe out the crops and drive them to concentration camps, fine. Not a problem.
*  So there was no protest and no discussion. But now there's more protest and discussion. Yes, because the country has gotten more civilized.
*  No U.S. president today, or for the last 20 years, could conceivably do what Kennedy could do with total impunity 40 years ago.
*  And the reason is because there was massive popular protest, opposed by the intellectual classes, of course, who hate it.
*  But it did, it led to all sorts of things, including opposition to aggression and violence.
*  It also spawned the contemporary civil rights movement, the feminist movement, the environmental movements and all sorts of other things.
*  And it imposed important constraints on straight violence. So in fact, that's how we got rid of slavery. That's how we got rid of feudalism.
*  That's how every step of- So are we moving towards an emancipation from these things? Slowly. You're optimistic about it?
*  Yes. Over time, there has been agonizingly slow progress, but very real, always opposed by the intellectuals who support violence and atrocities
*  and try to justify them and try to prevent the population from knowing about them. But fortunately, their control is limited.
*  And what will the state look like at the end? At the end? The end is a long time.
*  Okay, but what would we look like at the end? At the end, I think states ought to dissolve because I think they're illegitimate structures.
*  But that's a long time. But it is the end of the nation state that you foresee in the vision.
*  I don't foresee anything. What I'm saying is that as long as people, ordinary people, are able to free themselves from the doctrinal controls
*  imposed on them by their self-appointed betters and mentors, as long as they're able to do this, they'll continue to be able to struggle for peace and justice
*  and freedom and limitations on violence and constraints on power, as they've been doing for hundreds of years.
*  And I don't see any end to that. Where it'll end up in the long run, I can tell you where I'd like it to, but I wouldn't even dream about that.
*  The immediate problem is to free ourselves from the shackles imposed very consciously by the kind of people you're talking about,
*  who don't want the facts to be known, and for very good reasons. Because if people know the facts, they're not going to tolerate them.
*  So therefore you have to prevent them from knowing. You have to indoctrinate them. You have to tell them stories about how we're really good guys,
*  and if we use violence, it must be for the general good, because we represent the course of history.
*  That's the job of propagandists for power and violence. And it's the task of populations to free themselves from those kinds of controls and domination.
