# Noam Chomsky - Drugs
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [January 27, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIK46KSEXJU)
*  So if I take that cocaine and sell it to some particular person on the street...
*  Going to, but that's, to have it is not a crime.
*  Shouldn't be a crime in a civilized country.
*  Well certainly, I mean, again, whether it's an ounce of cocaine is, his intent is to sell it.
*  Well how about having a pack of cigarettes?
*  Having a pack of cigarettes?
*  That's going to kill people too. In fact it kills a lot more people than hard drugs do.
*  So you can't tell me where to get the cocaine and get behind a car, you know...
*  Sorry, if you want to compare it with being in the car, how about a can of beer?
*  A can of beer is far more lethal behind a car than cocaine is.
*  So in fact the matter is that having a substance should not be considered a crime because so far it's been the case.
*  If you want to talk about distributing substances that are lethal, yeah, that ought to be brought up.
*  But then let's be serious.
*  Tobacco is far ahead of anything else.
*  Alcohol is second.
*  Hard drugs are way down the bottom.
*  And furthermore most drug use, though it's very harmful for the person, has very little social effect.
*  The crime associated with hard drugs is mostly a consequence of criminalization.
*  Should we go after the people who sell cigarettes, make them cigarettes?
*  If the principle is let's not sell, let's not get lethal substances out to the public, the first one you'd go after is tobacco.
*  The next one you'd go after is alcohol.
*  Way down the list you'd get the cocaine and sort of invisibly low you'd get the marijuana.
*  In fact there have been...
*  A lot more violence comes from someone smoking some coke.
*  No it doesn't.
*  No it doesn't.
*  Someone smoking a cigarette?
*  No that's not true.
*  It comes from purchasing coke and selling coke, but that's because it's illegal.
*  That's because of the criminalization of it.
*  That's because of the criminalization, not the effect.
*  There are good studies of this.
*  The consequences...
*  Tobacco doesn't happen to cause violence, but alcohol definitely does.
*  The deaths that are alcohol related are way beyond the deaths that are hard drug related.
*  If you separate in the hard drug case the deaths that are the result of criminalization.
*  So yeah when you have drug gangs and narcotraffickers fighting for turf and so on, sure then there's going to be plenty of killings.
*  Just like when you had Al Capone running Chicago.
*  But that's a consequence of the criminalization, not the drugs.
*  What drugs tend to do is make people passive.
*  Alcohol on the other hand makes them violent.
*  That's the opposite of me.
*  It might be unusual.
*  But there's extensive studies of this.
*  There are extensive studies in the criminology literature.
*  And you can take a look at the results.
*  The basic result is that tobacco related deaths are way beyond anything else.
*  Just an order of magnitude greater.
*  Furthermore those are not just to the user, they're to everybody else.
*  So deaths from passive smoking alone are much higher than drug related deaths from passive smoking.
*  Furthermore they're transferred on to the next generation.
*  Alcohol is the next biggest killer.
*  And it's a killer not only for the people who use it, which is bad enough, but also to others because of its relation to violence.
*  Then comes next is things like hard drugs.
*  And they are rarely harmful to others.
*  They're harmful to the user.
*  When you get down to marijuana, last time I looked there had been about 60 million users and not one known case of overdose.
*  I mean it's not good for you undoubtedly.
*  But it's probably at the level of coffee.
*  And in fact notice that there has never been a medical reason for criminalizing marijuana.
*  I've looked through the history of this if you're interested.
*  I don't know if you want me to run through it.
*  But it's an interesting history.
*  Marijuana was criminalized.
*  See very commonly substances are criminalized because they're associated with what were called the dangerous classes.
*  You know, poor people or working people.
*  So for example in England in the 19th century there was a period when gin was criminalized and whiskey wasn't.
*  Because gin is what poor people drink.
*  That's kind of like the sentencing for crack and powder.
*  When in the early stages of prohibition in the United States, one of the targets was immigrant workers.
*  You know these guys hanging around the saloons in New York.
*  Got to go after them.
*  The rich guys in upstate New York.
*  They're going to drink no matter what.
*  They want to come home after work they'll drink.
*  But go after those guys.
*  What about marijuana?
*  Marijuana was brought in by Mexicans.
*  And the first criminalization of marijuana was in the Southwest in the States.
*  It was in New Mexico, later Utah and so on.
*  And it was specifically targeted against Mexicans.
*  It didn't get criminalized in the United States until shortly after prohibition ended.
*  After prohibition ended we had this huge bureau of narcotics.
*  And they had to do something.
*  So they discovered that marijuana is going to do all kind of horrible things to you.
*  The Senate testimony about this is mind-boggling.
*  They did have a representative of the American Medical Association who said we don't have any medical evidence about this.
*  He was shut up, denounced, you know, get rid of him right away.
*  Then they found somebody else.
*  This is literally true.
*  They found a pharmacologist, a guy teaching at Temple University, who was doing experiments with marijuana and dogs.
*  And they brought this guy in.
*  The testimony is hilarious.
*  You really have to read it.
*  They brought this guy in.
*  He testified that when he gave marijuana to the dogs they went insane.
*  They did all kind of things.
*  And then some senator or somebody asked him, this is from memories, it was probably a loft, but something like this.
*  I was in the 30s.
*  They asked the guy, well have you ever tried marijuana on humans?
*  So he said, yeah, he tried it on himself.
*  And he said, well what happened?
*  He said, I turned into a vulture.
*  I started flying around the room.
*  So they thought, oh my god, this stuff is terrible.
*  It makes people insane.
*  And marijuana, it was declared by Congress that marijuana makes people insane.
*  But then something happened.
*  It turned out that lawyers, defense lawyers, got the idea, okay, I can use this for an insanity defense.
*  So if a guy was found, you know, who killed three cops, his lawyer would say, well, you know, he had marijuana before, so he was insane.
*  So he can't do anything.
*  And people were getting off on charges, you know, like cop killing, for example, on the claim that they had marijuana.
*  So all of a sudden it was discovered that marijuana doesn't make you insane.
*  Congress decided, sorry, it doesn't make you insane because we want to wipe that out.
*  The next idea was marijuana is an entry drug.
*  It's the drug you take and then you go on to something else.
*  Well, there was never any evidence for that.
*  But that was decided.
*  And then in the early 50s, something else happened.
*  Marijuana is being brought in here by red Chinese to poison the American population and destroy us.
*  So therefore we got to stop marijuana.
*  And it kind of goes on like this.
*  Actually, the peak of marijuana use was, as I said, in the 70s.
*  But that was rich kids.
*  So you don't throw them in jail.
*  And then it got seriously criminalized.
*  You know, you really throw people in jail for it when it was poor people.
*  I mean, that's roughly the history.
*  The detailed history is quite interesting.
