# Noam Chomsky on Sitdown Strikes and Worker Ownership
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [January 23, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHGpEEt0aQI)
*  I mentioned before that in the 1930s one of the most effective actions was a sit-down strike.
*  The reason is very simple. That's just a step before takeover of the industry.
*  Well, through the 70s, as the decline was setting in, there were some very important events that took place.
*  One was in the late 70s, 1977, US Steel decided to close one of its major facilities, Youngstown, Ohio.
*  And instead of just walking away, the workforce and the community decided to get together and buy it from US Steel
*  and hand it over to the workforce to run and turn it into a worker-owned, worker-management facility.
*  They didn't win, but with enough popular support they could have won.
*  And it was a partial victory. It's a topic that Igor Alperovitz particularly has discussed in detail.
*  It was a partial victory because even though they lost, it set off other efforts.
*  And now throughout Ohio, but in fact in other places, there's a scattering of hundreds, maybe thousands of sometimes not so small,
*  worker-owned or at least partially worker-owned industries which could become worker-managed.
*  And that's the basis for a real revolution. That's how it takes place.
*  It's happening here too. Just in one of the suburbs of Boston about a year ago, something similar happened.
*  The multinational decided to close down a profitable functioning manufacturing facility,
*  bring some high-tech manufacturing, not profitable enough for them.
*  The workforce and the union offered to buy it and take it over and run it themselves.
*  The multinational decided to close it down instead probably for reasons of class consciousness.
*  I don't think they want things like this to happen.
*  If there had been enough popular support, if there had been something like this movement that could have gotten involved,
*  they might have succeeded. And there are other things going on like that.
*  In fact, some of them are major. So not long ago, Obama took over the auto industry.
*  It's basically owned by the public. And there were a number of things that could have been done.
*  One was what was done. Reconstitute it so that it can be handed back to the ownership or very similar ownership
*  and continue on its traditional path.
*  The other possibility was to hand it over to the workforce, which owned it anyway,
*  turn it into a worker-owned, worker-managed major industrial system that's a big part of the economy,
*  and have it produce things that people need.
