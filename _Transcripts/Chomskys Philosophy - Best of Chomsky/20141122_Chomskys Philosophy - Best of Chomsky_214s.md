# Noam Chomsky - The Population vs. Big Business
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [November 22, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BebN0Fx3_mA)
*  We have time for one more question.
*  So for those of you who've been standing, I apologize.
*  Professor Chomsky, I think one of the reasons that you see
*  crowds like this is people are interested in hearing these
*  things that don't get said very often and generally agree that,
*  gee, these are bad things.
*  How could the US government be involved in them?
*  Why do you think it is that most of the people feel one way
*  and yet our leaders invariably, and you cited Democratic
*  and Republican leaders, all of them across the board.
*  You said Carter, Clinton, both Bushes, Reagan.
*  Why do you think it is that our leaders don't feel the same way
*  that we do?
*  And when you say, OK, let's change policy so we're not the
*  major impediment, that's a great question.
*  Why don't they feel the same way we do?
*  It's brilliant.
*  Don't try to elaborate.
*  I don't think I mean, you know, I don't want to over generalize
*  there are a lot of different people in Congress and the
*  White House and so on.
*  But by and large, overwhelmingly, they simply
*  respond to different interests.
*  Seventy-five percent of the population who was skeptical of
*  the election were basically correct.
*  Policy is determined by power, by concentration of domestic
*  power, and it's not a big secret how power is concentrated
*  domestically.
*  It's concentrated in huge conglomerates, which are
*  internally tyrannies in effect.
*  They're mostly unaccountable to the public.
*  They're given enormous rights, far beyond the rights of
*  persons.
*  They're linked to one another in all kinds of alliances.
*  They have an overwhelming effect on state policy, which
*  largely keeps to what they want.
*  And if they happen to differ, if there's splits among them,
*  you get things coming up in elections.
*  Where they agree, it doesn't come up.
*  Like some of the major issues for the US population are
*  things like the International Economic Agreement, what are
*  called trade agreements, so they don't have much to do with
*  trade, or say the free trade area of the Americas, or the
*  trade deficit, and so on.
*  These are really top issues.
*  They don't come up in the elections.
*  And they don't come up in the elections for a
*  very simple reason.
*  The business world is on one side, and the population is on
*  the other side, very largely.
*  And they know it.
*  So like in the Wall Street Journal, they say the problem
*  is if these things come up, opponents of these agreements
*  have what they call an ultimate weapon, namely the general
*  population.
*  So therefore, we have to keep them from coming up.
*  And they don't come up in elections, and they're not
*  discussed.
*  And the population more or less knows that, even if they
*  don't know all the details about GATs and so on.
*  One day, or in front of them?
*  Yeah, except anyone who tries to break out of that rather
*  rigid framework is going to be marginalized, because they
*  don't have the resources, and they don't control them.
*  They don't have the media, and they don't have the
*  organization, and so on.
*  It's going to take large popular
*  movements to change this.
*  And that can happen.
*  It's happened in the past.
*  I mean, that's why freedom and justice have expanded over the
*  centuries.
*  It's never been gifts.
*  It wasn't gifts from the rich and powerful.
*  These are things that were won.
*  They were won by the labor movement, and by the women's
*  movement, and by the civil rights movement, and by human
*  rights movements.
*  They were won by popular struggle.
*  Then you move forward.
*  But they're never given as gifts, and they won't be in
*  the future.
