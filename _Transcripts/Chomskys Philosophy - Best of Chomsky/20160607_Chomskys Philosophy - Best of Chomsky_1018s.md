# Noam Chomsky - The Threat of Nuclear War
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [June 07, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBvE5TkKGYk)
*  Let's turn to the threat of instant destruction by nuclear weapons.
*  The record on that is extremely interesting and it demonstrates quite clearly that from
*  the earliest days, the security of the population has been a non-issue and remains so to the
*  present.
*  The record is shocking and insufficiently recognized.
*  I really urge you to look at it closely.
*  It strongly supports the lament of the General Lee Butler.
*  He's the last commander of the Strategic Air Command, which controls nuclear weapons
*  and weapons policy.
*  In his words, we have so far survived the nuclear age by some combination of skill,
*  luck and divine intervention, and I suspect the latter in the greatest proportion.
*  He goes on to say that we can hardly count on divine intervention as we continue to play
*  roulette with the fate of the species in pursuit of the driving factors in state policy.
*  He didn't add that, I added it.
*  So take a couple of illustrative examples beginning at the start of the atomic age.
*  At that time, this was 1950, the US was overwhelmingly powerful, enjoyed remarkable security, nothing
*  like it in history, controlled the Western Hemisphere, controlled both oceans, controlled
*  the opposite sides of both oceans, had 50% of the world's wealth, just incomparable
*  power and security.
*  There was, however, one potential threat, potential at that time, that was ICBMs with
*  hydrogen bomb warheads.
*  They didn't exist, but they might exist someday.
*  There is actually a standard scholarly review of nuclear policies written with access to
*  high-level documents.
*  It's by McGeorge Bundy, who was the national security advisor for the Kennedy and Johnson
*  administrations.
*  And what he writes is that he describes the development of ICBMs with nuclear warheads
*  as one of the great achievements of the Eisenhower administration.
*  But he then adds that it's useful to recognize that both the United States and the Soviet
*  Union might be in much less nuclear danger today if these missiles had never been developed.
*  And he adds a very instructive comment.
*  He says, I am aware of no proposal, could find no proposal in the literature, either
*  in or out of government, that these missiles should be banned by agreement.
*  Nobody even considered it.
*  There was no thought at all of trying to prevent the sole serious threat to the United
*  States, threat of utter destruction.
*  And this striking fact merits a phrase in the standard comprehensive history and has
*  been ignored in commentary.
*  I can't find anyone who's ever even referred to it.
*  Well, could it have been prevented?
*  Would a treaty have been possible?
*  I can't be sure, of course, but there's some indication that it would have been possible.
*  One suggestive indication is a remarkable proposal by Stalin in 1952.
*  He offered to allow Germany to be unified with free elections, which, of course, the
*  communists would lose, but with a condition that it not join a hostile military alliance.
*  Again, hardly an extreme condition in the light of history.
*  Well, Stalin's proposal was received in the United States, but it was ignored or,
*  whenever mentioned, just ridiculed.
*  Actually, recent scholarship, which now has access to Russian archives, has begun to take
*  quite a different view and an illuminating one.
*  One case is Adam Ulam.
*  He's a bitterly anti-communist Harvard scholar, leading specialist on Bolshevik Russia.
*  Here's what he says.
*  He says, the status of Stalin's proposal is an unresolved mystery.
*  Washington wasted little effort in flatly rejecting Moscow's initiative on grounds
*  that were embarrassingly unconvincing, leaving open the basic question.
*  Was Stalin genuinely ready to sacrifice the GDR on the altar of real democracy with consequences
*  for world peace and real security that would have been enormous?
*  One of the most prominent Cold War scholars, Melvin Loeffler, reviewing recent research
*  Soviet archives writes that scholars are surprised to discover that Lavrenty Beria,
*  the sinister, brutal head of the secret police, proposed that the Kremlin offer the West a deal
*  on unification and neutralization of Germany, agreeing to sacrifice the East German
*  communist regime to reduce East-West tensions and, of course, to improve political and economic
*  conditions in Russia, opportunities, he points out, that were squandered in favor of gaining
*  West German participation in NATO.
*  Well, under those circumstances, it's not at all impossible that agreements might have
*  been reached that would have protected the security of the population from the gravest
*  imaginable threat, total destruction.
*  But the possibility was not considered.
*  Another striking indication of how slight a role authentic security plays in state policy.
*  Incidentally, this tells us quite a lot about intellectuals in the United States and Europe.
*  Try to find any discussion of this.
*  Well, that was revealed again in the years that followed.
*  A couple of years later, Nikita Khrushchev took office.
*  He recognized right away that Russia could not compete militarily with the United States,
*  the richest, most powerful country in history.
*  And he recognized that if Russia hoped to escape from its economic backwardness, and,
*  of course, the devastating effects of the Second World War, it would be necessary to
*  reverse the arms race.
*  So he proposed sharp reductions in offensive weapons, mutual reductions.
*  The incoming Kennedy administration considered the offer and rejected it.
*  Instead, they turned to rapid military expansion.
*  Late Kenneth Waltz, one of the leading, most respected international relations scholars,
*  describes it like this.
*  He said, the Kennedy administration undertook the largest strategic and conventional
*  peacetime military buildup the world has yet seen as Khrushchev was trying to carry through
*  a major reduction in conventional forces and to follow a strategy of minimum deterrence.
*  And we did so.
*  The U.S. did so, though the balance of strategic weapons greatly favored the United States.
*  Again, a decision to harm national security, security of the population, while enhancing
*  state power.
*  That's Kennedy.
*  A major reason why Kennedy barely squeaked to victory in 1960 was his charge that Eisenhower
*  and Nixon had permitted the Russians to leap ahead in offensive weaponry, creating what
*  they called a missile gap that severely threatened U.S. security.
*  That frightened the population enough so that Kennedy barely won the election.
*  In reality, the U.S. was far in the lead.
*  The Russians had four operational ICBMs, a tiny fraction of the U.S. arsenal.
*  And this was quickly understood.
*  And speaking for the administration, McGeorge Bundy again, he explained that they had nevertheless
*  been right in emphasizing a fake missile gap because, as he put it, the phrase had a useful
*  shorthand effect of calling attention to our basic military posture.
*  That's an allusion to the posture of rapidly expanding, overwhelming U.S. dominance and
*  threat and rejecting security and the prospects for survival.
*  Well, the Russians did react.
*  The reaction was to place missiles in Cuba in October 1962.
*  That move was motivated also by Kennedy's huge terrorist campaign against Cuba, which
*  is mostly suppressed, but there's plenty of evidence about it, which was scheduled to
*  lead to invasion in October 1962, the month when the missiles were in place.
*  That brought the world to the most dangerous moment in history, Kennedy advisor Arthur
*  Schlesinger's phrase historian.
*  As the crisis peaked in late October, Kennedy received a secret letter from Khrushchev offering
*  to end the crisis by simultaneous public withdrawal of Russian missiles from Cuba and U.S. Jupiter
*  missiles from Turkey.
*  These Jupiter missiles were obsolete missiles.
*  Withdrawal order had already been given for them because they were being replaced by far
*  more lethal, essentially invulnerable Polaris submarines.
*  Kennedy's subjective estimate was that if he refused this offer, the probability of
*  nuclear war was between a third and a half, a war that would have destroyed the Northern
*  Hemisphere, as President Eisenhower had stated.
*  He refused.
*  It's hard to think of a more horrendous decision in human history, and worse, he's praised
*  for his cool courage and statesmanship.
*  Ten years later, Henry Kissinger called a nuclear alert in the last days of the 1973
*  Israel-Arab war.
*  The purpose was to warn the Russians not to interfere with his delicate diplomatic maneuvers.
*  These were designed to ensure an Israeli victory, but a limited victory so that the U.S. would
*  still be in control of the region unilaterally.
*  And the maneuvers were indeed delicate.
*  The United States and Russia had jointly imposed a ceasefire, but Kissinger secretly informed
*  Israel that they could ignore it, and therefore he called a nuclear alert to frighten the
*  Russians away.
*  The security of the population had its usual status, zero.
*  Ten years after that, the Reagan administration came in, and they decided to launch operations
*  to probe Russian defenses.
*  The way they did it was by simulating air and naval attacks against Russia, and also
*  calling the highest-level nuclear alert, which is, of course, known to the Russians.
*  All of this was undertaken at a very tense moment.
*  Pershing II missiles were being deployed in Europe.
*  These had a five-minute flight time to Moscow.
*  Reagan announced the so-called Star Wars program, missile defense, which the Russians understood
*  to be a first-strike weapon.
*  That's how missile defense is understood on all sides for good reasons.
*  And other tensions were rising.
*  Well, naturally, the Russians were quite alarmed by this.
*  Unlike the United States, Russia is quite vulnerable, had repeatedly been invaded, almost
*  destroyed.
*  And that led to a major war scare in 1983.
*  There are newly released archives that reveal that the danger was much more severe than
*  historians had previously assumed.
*  There's a CIA study that just appeared.
*  It's called The War Scare Was for Real.
*  They conclude that CIA concludes that the US underestimated Russian concerns and the
*  threat of a Russian reaction.
*  The major journal on this topic, Journal of Strategic Studies, writes that these Reagan
*  exercises almost became a pre-prelude to a preventive nuclear strike, which would have
*  wiped out the Northern Hemisphere.
*  And in fact, it was more dangerous than that.
*  We learned last September.
*  It was revealed that right in the midst of these world-threatening developments, Russia's
*  automated early warning systems detected an incoming missile strike from the United States,
*  sending the highest level alert.
*  Well, the protocol for the Soviet military, like the American military, is to retaliate
*  at once with a nuclear attack of its own.
*  There was an officer on duty, Stanislav Petrov.
*  He decided to disobey the orders and not to report the warning to his superiors.
*  And thanks to his dereliction of duty, we're alive to talk about it.
*  That was 1983.
*  You can determine how much publicity has been given to all of this.
*  Well, security for the population was no more a priority for the Reagan planners than
*  for their predecessors, and that continues right to the present.
*  In fact, pretty obvious when you take a look at what's going on in Ukraine.
*  And plans for the future are even more frightening.
*  Obama came into office with nice rhetoric about cutting back the arms race.
*  In fact, he's exceeding his predecessor, George Bush, in expanding the nuclear weapons arsenal.
*  The United States under Obama is now planning to spend more than a trillion dollars on the
*  nuclear arsenal in the next 30 years.
*  And of course, the United States is not alone, though it's in the lead.
*  So going back to General Butler, it's a near miracle that we've escaped destruction so far,
*  and the longer we tempt fate, the less likely it is that we can hope for divine intervention
*  to rescue us from our folly.
*  Well, we're all surely aware, just to conclude, that we now face the most ominous decisions in human history.
*  There are lots of problems that should be addressed, but two of them are overwhelming in their significance.
*  Environmental destruction, nuclear war.
*  For the first time in history, we face the prospects of destroying the possibility of decent existence
*  and not in the distant future.
*  For this reason alone, it's imperative to sweep away the ideological clouds, face honestly and realistically
*  the question of how policy decisions are made and what we can do to alter them before it's too late.
