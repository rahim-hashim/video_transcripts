# Noam Chomsky - Materialism, Limited Understanding and Innate Moral Principles
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [December 16, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ARDKad9KwU)
*  There was a concept of materialism right through the early scientific revolution, right through Newton.
*  Newton still accepted it. In fact, the great scientists of the next century accepted it.
*  You know, Lagrange and others kept trying to develop a material mechanistic concept of the universe
*  that went right through the 19th century, Aether theories and so on.
*  It was finally given up in the 20th century, you know, finally recognized, look, we're never going to get it.
*  And totally different ways of looking at things were developed, which have no relation to traditional materialism.
*  Friedrich Lang is correct. So since, and nobody's ever suggested another notion,
*  materialism just is like anything we more or less understand.
*  It includes thinking, it includes reasoning and so on and so forth, block suggestion.
*  So we can't leave it behind unless someone tells it what it is, but there's no reason why we can't study it.
*  We can study what the human capacity of understanding is.
*  In fact, we know some things about it. We know some negative things.
*  For example, we can't understand the way the world works because our concept of understanding is too limited
*  to incorporate what Newton described as an absurdity.
*  You know, people like Newton and Hume and Locke were not idiots.
*  I take them seriously. They regarded it as an absurdity for very good reasons.
*  And modern cognitive science, which somehow tries to recapitulate some of this, finds pretty much that.
*  So, as I mentioned, an infant presented with presentations
*  which indicate that there's some kind of causality, like, you know, when the wall rolls this way, light turns red or something.
*  They will invent a mechanical cause and they don't care if it's not visible
*  because infants understand that most of what goes on is invisible.
*  You know, but there's got to be some mechanical cause, otherwise no way for it to influence anything else.
*  So that does seem to be the way our minds work.
*  And that tells us something about the limits of our understanding.
*  In fact, a classical, crucial case. And it can go on to other cases.
*  So, and we can't study it directly. In principle, we can study it directly.
*  It's not simple. I mean, it's not easy to understand why a rat can't understand, can't deal with a prime number maze.
*  Even that's hard. And we have good evidence that's true.
*  But why it's true is unclear.
*  There's nothing known about the brains of rats that explains why they can't do that.
*  In fact, we can't explain why, say, the tiniest organism that's seriously studied,
*  C. elegans, nematodes, 800 cells, 300 neurons, entire wiring diagram known.
*  There have been years of study trying to explain why this thing, it goes left instead of right, let's say.
*  It's just, we don't know how to explain that.
*  It's not as an answer, but these are hard scientific questions.
*  When you talk about how human intelligence works, it's incomparably more difficult.
*  So you can ask the questions. You can, you know, cut away at them.
*  But we shouldn't exaggerate. It's kind of striking that going back to what philosophy ought to do.
*  Philosophers often appear to intend to want to get answers about humans that we can't get about insects.
*  And that's too much, you know.
*  Science sort of works at the edges of understanding, and it faces hard questions all the way.
*  So we can sort of talk about it.
*  But if you want to seriously work on it, you have to take a look at what is understood and try to see if you can formulate questions,
*  which can be investigated and will tell us more about what's understood.
*  Actually, there's interesting work going on on this having to do with things like the human moral instinct.
*  In the past 20, 30 years, that's become an experimental subject with interesting experimental work on universal, probably universal moral principles.
*  A very important book just came out a couple of weeks ago by John Michael.
*  He's a philosopher who now teaches law at Georgetown University, who gives a very acute, he more or less initiated this modern study.
*  He didn't publish much, but other people have drawn off his work.
*  Combination of reanalysis of traditional moral philosophy, mainly Rawls and his antecedents, and analysis, a lot of the critique of Rawls,
*  and then on to developing experimental programs to investigate some of these questions.
*  And it's feasible.
*  Maybe we can get some insight into innate human moral concepts that are that are cross-cultural,
*  like you're going to find them in every culture and that you can find with young children,
*  pre any serious cultural impact.
*  Those are all things that can be studied, and there's beginnings of study.
