# Noam Chomsky - The Alternative to Capitalism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [February 05, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUzquEya6Lw)
*  First of all, we should bear in mind that we don't have a capitalist system.
*  No capitalist system has ever survived.
*  It would self-destruct in five minutes.
*  So what we have is a kind of state capitalist system with a state playing a substantial
*  role in American history, a very substantial role in economic development, in production,
*  in research and development, a lot of other bailouts, lots of other devices to keep the
*  private sector viable.
*  So it's a kind of a state capitalist system like others, but they vary a little on how
*  they do it.
*  So is there an alternative to this, of course?
*  For example, the alternative that was taken for granted by 19th century workers before
*  it was sort of beaten out of people's heads by massive propaganda.
*  If you go back to the early Industrial Revolution, which was right around here in eastern Massachusetts,
*  it was the period probably the freest press ever in the United States.
*  There were lots and lots of newspapers representing different ethnic groups, class workers, all
*  sorts of people.
*  And there was a lot of participation, direct participation, very lively press, widely read
*  and so on.
*  And if you look at the working class press, they were expressing the common view of working
*  people, namely that those who work in the mills should own them and run them.
*  Yeah, that's very natural.
*  And as I say, we've come close to that a number of times, terrifying to private owners.
*  They also held that wage labor is basically no different from chattel slavery, except
*  that it's temporary.
*  And that was such a popular idea that it was a position of the Republican Party that Abraham
*  Lincoln espoused.
*  And that makes sense.
*  I mean, there's nothing wholly about wage labor.
*  You are renting yourself, which is not very different from being a slave, except that
*  maybe it'll end sometime.
*  Okay, so those are alternatives.
*  There's democratic control of institutions, whether they're communities or workplaces
*  or any others, alliances among them, federal arrangements.
*  These are all perfectly feasible alternatives.
*  There's no economic or political theory that tells us there's anything wrong with them.
*  They conflict with the structure of existing power systems, and therefore the educational
*  and cultural system tries to drive them out of your minds and make them seem insane or
*  crazy or unthinkable.
*  But there's nothing unthinkable about them.
*  And you can move towards realizing them.
*  In fact, even in the United States, where you get no major discussion of these things,
*  there are probably thousands of self-managed enterprises, not huge ones, but lots of them,
*  and they're growing.
*  And they could, as I mentioned, they could reach the scale of, say, producing the green
*  technology, high-speed rail and so on, that the country badly needs.
*  It's not a law of nature that we have to import solar technology from China, a poor developing
*  country, or that we have to get high-speed rail facilities from Spain.
*  Those aren't laws of nature.
*  Those are political decisions, social, economic, and political decisions.
*  They can be made differently.
*  If they're made differently enough, we'll be moving towards a kind of an anarchist-type society.
