# Noam Chomsky - Your Moral Responsibility
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [September 05, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9ahT5A5uzw)
*  You say that what the media do is to ignore certain kinds of atrocities that are committed by us and our friends,
*  and to play up enormously atrocities that are committed by them and our enemies.
*  And you posit, in fact you say in the Massie lecture, is that there's a test of integrity and moral honesty,
*  which is to have a kind of equality of treatment of corpses.
*  Equality of principles.
*  I mean, that every dead person should be in principle equal to every other dead person.
*  Well, I'm glad that's not what you're saying, because that's not what you do.
*  Of course it's not what I do, nor would I say it. In fact, I say the opposite.
*  What I say is that we should be responsible for our own actions primarily. That's something quite different.
*  But it is different with 100 priests.
*  I wasn't equating them. I was comparing the treatment of them.
*  If you want my value judgment, we should give much more attention to one priest who we've killed than to 100 priests that they've killed.
*  Notice that this is exactly the method.
*  Because your method is to ignore, is not so much to, not only to ignore the corpses created by them,
*  but also to ignore the corpses that are created by neither side, but which are irrelevant to your ideological...
*  That's totally untrue.
*  Well, let me give you an example.
*  That one of your own causes that you take very seriously is the cause of the Palestinians.
*  And a Palestinian corpse worries very heavily on your conscience.
*  And yet a Kurdish corpse does not.
*  That's not true at all.
*  I've been involved in Kurdish support groups for years.
*  That's absolutely true. That's absolutely false.
*  I just ask the Kurdish, ask the people who are involved, and they come to me, I sign their petitions, and so on and so forth.
*  And if you look at the things we've written, and it takes like, take a look, I'm not Amnesty International.
*  I can't do everything on a single universal person.
*  But if you read, say, take a look, say, at the book that Edward Herman and I wrote on this topic.
*  We wrote a book about this in 1979.
*  In it, we discuss three kinds of atrocities.
*  Not two, three kinds of bloodbaths.
*  What we call benign bloodbaths, which nobody cares about, constructive bloodbaths, which are the ones we like,
*  and nefarious bloodbaths, which are the ones that the bad guys do.
*  Constructive bloodbaths are things like the Indonesian massacres, which we supported.
*  Nefarious bloodbaths are like Palpat.
*  But we also discuss ones that nobody cares about, like Burundi.
*  For example, we have probably the only discussion in the literature, I guess, of the massacres that were going on in Burundi at that time.
*  We probably have the only discussion of literature that I know of, of the massacres that were going on in Burma.
*  In fact, not only is what you say not true, but it's the opposite of the truth.
*  We went out of our way to find the kinds of bloodbaths that are just ignored because nobody cares about them.
*  Now, again, let me stress, I'm not Amnesty International.
*  I do not have the ludicrous egotism, which makes me the arbiter of all atrocities over the world.
*  I'm not trying to give an A to this country and a B minus to this country and so on.
*  The principle that I think we ought to follow is not the one that you stated.
*  It's the principle that we rightly expect Soviet dissidents to follow.
*  What principle do we expect Sakharov to follow, let's say?
*  What lets us decide whether Sakharov is a moral person? I think he is.
*  Sakharov does not treat every atrocity as identical.
*  He has nothing to say about American atrocities.
*  When he's asked, he says, I don't know anything about them. I don't care about them.
*  What he talks about is Soviet atrocities, and that's right, because those are the ones that he's responsible for.
*  It's a very simple, ethical point.
*  You're responsible for the predictable consequences of your actions.
*  You're not responsible for the predictable consequences of somebody else's actions.
*  Now, we understand this when we're talking about dissidents in the Soviet Union.
*  But we refuse to understand it when we're talking about ourselves for very good reasons.
*  Commissars in the Soviet Union don't understand it about dissidents.
*  Commissars in the Soviet Union attack Sakharov and other dissidents because they don't talk about American crimes.
*  We understand exactly why that's just hypocrisy and cynicism when they do it, and we should understand the same when we do it.
*  Now, the fact of the matter is that I spend a fair amount of effort on crimes of official enemies.
*  There are a fair number of people in the United States and Canada from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe who are there because of my personal activities on their behalf.
*  I don't take any pride in that particularly. I just do it because I'm interested in it.
*  The most important thing for me and for you is to think about the consequences of your actions.
*  What can you affect? Those are the ones you primarily ought to be concerned about.
*  Of course every corpse is a corpse, but there's some that you can affect and there are others you can't do much about.
*  I can be worried about things that happened in the 18th century, but I can't do much about them.
