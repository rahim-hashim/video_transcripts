# Noam Chomsky - The Evolution of Cognition
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [March 21, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuVyusAu-mo)
*  Dr. Chomsky, if I understand correctly, you hypothesize a natural language that's kind
*  of a functionality in the brain and what we actually speak is kind of a simple epiphenomenon
*  on top of that and that the actual language is more complex and rich than we actually
*  ever use. Do you have any hypothesis on how all the sexist capacity came to be there?
*  Yeah. So, and it just seems to be a fact that our language capacities involve, I mean, some
*  things just seem to be factually correct, say that there are garden path sentences.
*  There are sentences which where our mind, the mechanisms of our mind assign to them
*  a certain set of properties, but when we perceive the sentence, our interpretive capacity doesn't
*  assign them those properties. We have to go through some other course of inquiry using
*  our scientific capacities and so on to notice that discrepancy. There seem to be things
*  like that and that just looks well established. So, why did it happen? Why did we get this
*  system? That's like asking how we got anything else. Why did we get a circulatory system?
*  Why do we have arms? Virtually nothing is known about those questions. I mean, there
*  are things known at the very, there's something known about why a mixture of simple gases
*  with an electrical spark going through it can ultimately turn into something remotely
*  like, not really like, but the beginnings of a bacterium. I mean, at that level some
*  things are understood and they're understood because the physical laws involved are more
*  or less grass. There are things understood, some things understood about the basic forms
*  that exist in life, you know, bilateral symmetry, you know, there's some biophysical things
*  that are understood more or less. But when you ask why particular organs exist, you can't
*  say any. You can say some weak things. You can say that things won't be around if they're
*  harmful to reproduction because then they'll die off through natural selection. That you
*  can say. And you can say a few other things. You can say some things about population genetics
*  and so on. But you can't say anything much about these topics. And in fact, you know,
*  I don't think serious evolutionary biologists have any doubts about this. If you want to
*  get a good picture of it from the point of view of one of the best, have a look at Richard
*  Lewontin's article on the evolution of cognition in the third volume of the Encyclopedia of
*  Cognitive Sciences that was published, edited by Daniel Osherson and other people, published
*  by MIT Press a year or so ago, where he goes on to give, I think, a very plausible argument
*  as to why not only do we know nothing about the evolution of cognition, but it's not even
*  clear that there's a question there that we can ask seriously. I mean, the reason why
*  we have the kinds of systems we do in the brain is probably because that's the way physics
*  works. As he says pretty reasonably, for all we know, when the brain reaches a certain
*  level of, you know, the brain may have gotten very big in order to do things like to take
*  a semi-joke which he gives to cool the blood. I mean, it could have been a thermoregulator.
*  It's not impossible, like Aristotle thought, that the brain was a thermoregulator, cooled
*  the blood, that's why it got so much blood flowing around. When it reached a certain
*  scale and complexity, because of the way physics works and biology works and so on, it just
*  had certain properties. One of those properties could have been, you know, sort of ability
*  to solve some kind of problems or a language capacity or something else. If cognitive capacities
*  are like other things in the biological world, that's probably the right kind of answer.
*  Now, you know, once some of those capacities were around, it's conceivable that they contributed
*  to differential reproduction, in which case you would tend to have, you know, more individuals
*  around with those properties. But as he points out, even that isn't very reasonable. I mean,
*  if you remember that most of human evolution was sort of small hunter-gatherer societies,
*  you know, little groups of people who were sort of foraging around for food and trying
*  to avoid saber-toothed tigers and things like that. And as Lewontin points out, if
*  you want to construct, you can construct all kinds of fairy tales and stories about this.
*  He says, well, how about the following fairy tale? How about the one that says that you
*  were more likely to live and hence reproduce if you were dumber and less imaginative? Now,
*  as he points out, there's some plausibility to that. I mean, if you've got a group of
*  hunter-gatherers and one of them happens to be courageous and, you know, imaginative and
*  he wants to try to see where that saber-toothed tiger is going and so on, he'll probably get,
*  he's more likely to get killed. Now, his presence in the tribe may help the tribe survive, but
*  his genes aren't going to be transmitted because he's more likely to get killed. The ones who
*  are more likely to survive are the ones who are cleverly sitting at home and waiting for
*  him to kill the tiger and bring in the food. So maybe there's selection for stupidity and
*  for lack of imagination and so on, so that then you get the opposite of the development
*  of cognitive development. As he points out, that's as good a fairy tale as any other.
