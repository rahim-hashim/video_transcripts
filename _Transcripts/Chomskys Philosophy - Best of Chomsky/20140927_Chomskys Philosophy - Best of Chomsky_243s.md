# Noam Chomsky - Legal vs Illegal
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [September 27, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w_mTXrGe-E)
*  One does not necessarily allow the state to define what is legal.
*  Now, the state has the power to enforce a certain concept of what is legal,
*  but power doesn't imply justice or correctness even.
*  So the state may define something as civil disobedience and may be wrong in doing so.
*  For example, in the United States, the state defines it as civil disobedience to,
*  let's say, derail an ammunition train that's going to Vietnam,
*  and the state is wrong in defining that as civil disobedience
*  because it's legal and proper and should be done.
*  It's proper to carry out actions that will prevent the criminal acts of the state,
*  just as it's proper to violate a traffic ordinance in order to prevent a murder.
*  If I was standing at a street corner and the traffic light were red,
*  let's say I was standing in my car and I drove across the traffic light
*  to prevent somebody from, let's say, machine gunning a group of people,
*  of course that's not violation of law.
*  It's an appropriate and proper action.
*  No sane judge would convict you for such an action.
*  Similarly, a good deal of what the state authorities define as civil disobedience
*  is not really civil disobedience.
*  In fact, it's legal, in fact obligatory behavior in violation of the commands of the state,
*  which may or may not be legal commands.
*  So one has to be rather careful about calling things illegal, I think.
*  Which I regard as illegal, not just the state.
*  No, the state regards as illegal.
*  The state considers as illegal.
*  Yeah.
*  I understand.
*  Yeah.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Yes.
*  Again, very often when I do something which the state regards as illegal,
*  I regard it as legal.
*  Yes.
*  Because I regard the state as criminal.
*  But in some instances that's not true.
*  That is, let me be quite concrete about it,
*  and move from the area of class war to imperialist war,
*  where the situation is somewhat clearer and easier.
*  Take international law, a very weak instrument as we know,
*  but nevertheless it incorporates some rather interesting principles.
*  Well, international law in many respects is the instrument of the powerful.
*  That is, international law permits much too wide a range
*  of international forceful intervention
*  in support of existing power structures that define themselves as states
*  and against the interests of masses of people
*  who happen to be organized in opposition to states.
*  But in fact, international law is not solely of that kind.
*  And in fact, there are interesting elements of international law,
*  let's say embedded in the United Nations Charter,
*  which permit, in fact I believe require the citizen to act against his own state
*  in ways that the state will falsely regard as criminal.
*  But nevertheless he's acting legally,
*  because international law also happens to prohibit the threat
*  or use of force in international affairs,
*  except under some very narrow circumstances of which, for example,
*  the war in Vietnam is not won,
*  which means that in the particular case of, let's say, the Vietnam War,
*  the one that interests me most,
*  the American state is acting in a criminal capacity
*  and people have the right to stop criminals from murdering people.
*  Just because the criminal happens to call your action illegal
*  when you try to stop him, that doesn't mean it is illegal.
*  I mean, a perfectly clear case of that is the present case of the Pentagon Papers
*  in the United States, which I suppose you know about.
*  Reduced to its essentials and forgetting legalisms,
*  what is happening is that the state is trying to prosecute people
*  for exposing its crimes.
*  That's what it amounts to.
