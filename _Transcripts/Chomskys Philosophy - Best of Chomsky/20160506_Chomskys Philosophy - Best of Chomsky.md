# Noam Chomsky - Artificial Intelligence I
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 06, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfxqqmIjLOs)
*  There's two kinds of AI. One kind seeks to carry out computer modeling to try to discover
*  the nature of some biological system, usually human intelligence, but it could be insect
*  intelligence. That's just normal science. It's part of normal science, just like work
*  and physics and chemistry and so on. There's another kind of AI which is oriented towards
*  developing things that are useful for some purpose, like a robot that can go into a radioactive
*  environment or will clean your floor or something like that. Now these two types of AI aren't
*  totally separated. They interact, but they're two quite different conceptions. The first kind,
*  as I said, is normal science. So in that sense, I work in AI. The second kind is basically
*  engineering, which can be useful or not useful. Well done, not well done. As for the future of
*  AI, it's essentially the question. There's two answers. The engineering applications can
*  presumably be improved, do lots of important things that will contribute to better life and
*  so on, maybe remove the boring aspects of work and free people up to be more creative and so on.
*  That's all to the good, if that's the way it goes. The second kind is a question of the limits of
*  our scientific understanding as a technique, as a method for investigating cognitive systems,
*  maybe human, maybe insect navigation, whatever you happen to be studying. We can't predict the
*  future of science. As to these concerns about AI somehow leading to some result that's going
*  to be catastrophic for humans, I think that's fantasy. It vastly exaggerates what's understood
