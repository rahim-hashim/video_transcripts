# Noam Chomsky on Libertarian Socialism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [October 21, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3m4aRQ9QvQ)
*  Here the term libertarian means the opposite of what it always meant in history.
*  Libertarian throughout modern European history meant socialist anarchists.
*  It meant the anti-... I mean the socialist movement, the workers movement and socialist movements,
*  sort of broke into two branches roughly, one statist, one anti-statist.
*  The statist branch led to Bolshevism and
*  Lenin and Trotsky and so on. The anti-statist branch which included Marxists, left Marxists,
*  Hancock, Groseluxenburg, others, it's kind of merged more or less into an amalgam with a
*  big strain of anarchism into what was called libertarian socialism. So libertarian in Europe
*  always meant socialist. Here it means ultra, you know, Ayn Rand or Cato Institute or something
*  like that, but that's a special U.S. usage having to do with a lot of things quite special about the
*  way the United States developed and this is part of it. There it meant and always meant to me
*  socialist, anti-socialist, anti-state, the anti-state branch of socialism which meant
*  a highly organized society, totally completely organized, nothing to do with chaos,
*  but based on a democracy all the way through. That means democratic control of communities,
*  of workplaces, of federal structures built on systems of voluntary association
*  spreading internationally. That's traditional anarchism. At least, you know, anybody can have
*  the word if they like, but it's a mainstream, probably the mainstream of traditional anarchism
*  and it has roots in the coming back to the United States. It has very strong roots in the American
*  working class movements. So if you go back to say the 1850s, the beginnings of the industrial
*  revolution, so right around the area where I live in eastern Massachusetts, textile plants and so on,
*  the people working in those plants were in part young women coming off the farms.
*  They were called factory girls. So the women come to the farms and work in the textile plant.
*  They, from their point of view, what they called wage slavery, renting yourself to an owner,
*  was not very different from chattel slavery, you know, what they were fighting the Civil War about
*  and you have to recall that by the, in the mid 19th century, that was a common view in the United
*  States. For example, it was the position of the Republican Party. It was Abraham Lincoln's position.
*  It's not an odd view, but there isn't much difference between selling yourself and renting
*  yourself. So the idea of renting yourself, meaning working for wages, was degrading.
*  You couldn't, it was just an attack on your personal integrity. The, and they despised the
*  industrial system that was developing, that was destroying their culture, destroying their
*  independence, their individuality, constraining them to be subordinate to masters, losing,
*  there was a tradition of what was called republicanism in the United States. We're free people,
*  you know, the first free people in the world. This was destroying and undermining that freedom.
*  This was the core of the labor movement all over and included in it was the assumption,
*  just taken for granted, that those, quoting those who work in the mills should run.
*  You've repeatedly defined anarchism as the view that the burden of proof is on the authority. And
*  if that burden fails to be met, then the authority is illegitimate and should be dismantled.
*  But you also seem to use the terms anarcho-syndicalism and our theme for today,
*  libertarian socialism, interchangeably with anarchism. Is there a difference between these
*  terms and if so, can you describe the differences? Well, first of all, anarchism covers a very wide
*  range. I mean, the, what you just quoted seems to me like a kind of a core principle of anyone who's
*  involved anywhere in anarchist movements should at least accept that, that authority is not
*  self-justifying. The authority, the hierarchic institutions,
*  authoritarian structures, structures of dominance and control are, have a burden of proof. I mean,
*  they don't, they're not self-justifying. They have to meet a challenge. They should be challenged.
*  And I think that everyone ought to be an anarchist in that sense. It doesn't carry any, then come
*  further questions about what you do about it. But it ought to be challenged. And if,
*  if it can't meet the burden of proof, which is usually the case, then not always, then they
*  should be dismantled. That's, this should be done everywhere, you know, from families to international
*  affairs, professions, science, whatever it is. Actually, it's kind of striking that in some
*  domains it's just taken for granted. Like in the, in the sciences, if you're science students, it's
*  assumed that the task for students is to challenge. You're not supposed to just copy what you heard.
*  The fields would die if they did. So you're supposed to challenge, request, demand evidence
*  and proof. And if you can't find it, change it. But that ought to extend to all of life. Now,
*  anarcho-syndicalism is a little bit different. That is a particular brand of anarchism, which was
*  particularly concerned with things like workers' control, control by working people of production,
*  the means of production, decisions over production. This is like a kind of a core
*  part of it. That's the syndicalist part. Libertarian socialism is just the traditional
*  word for anarchism. It's, I mean, it's a French term originally. And so if you take a look at the
*  French journals, socialism, libertaire, they're just anarchist journals. It's the non-statist
*  component of the anarchist tradition. And a lot of it was anarcho-syndicalist in character. So
*  one of the main French writers, Daniel Guevain, published major volumes on libertarian socialism,
*  who's basically dealing with the anarcho-syndicalist variant of it. Of course,
*  there are plenty of other things that call themselves anarchist. So this is by no means
*  the whole story. Libertarian socialists envision and work to create, predictably enough,
*  libertarian socialist society. What would be the core features? What are the core features of that
*  theory? What are the core features of that society? Well, apart from accepting the general
*  principle of anarchism, it tends to concentrate on the productive system. So for example, workers'
*  control in industry, control of other institutions by people who participate in them.
*  It's not inconsistent with what's sometimes called communitarian anarchism, which concentrates on
*  control of communities by participants. In fact, they generally, both groups, think these ought to
*  be integrated. It's a question of where the focus of attention is. But I don't think there are real
*  conflicts. It's just a question of what's prioritized, what's the center of concern and
*  activity, what other things will flow from it. Partly tactical choices, partly ideas about
*  where the source of creativity, power, search for freedom would be in a society. You can have
*  different views on that. When we talk about anarchism, it's often about, well, people
*  understand it as not being organized, as being a kind of chaos. But in fact, it's trying to find
*  the institutions that can be effective but are minimally coercive. In a libertarian socialist
*  society, what kind of institutions would that be? Well, within the main libertarian socialist,
*  especially anarcho-syndicalist tradition, what's assumed is it should be a highly organized society.
*  It should be based on popular control at every level. So it begins with, for example,
*  control by working people of whatever institution they're working in, factory,
*  offices, whatever it might be, and control of communities. And then these should be integrated
*  through voluntary association that could be regional. Then there should be federated
*  structures that extend beyond and on to an organization of international society.
*  But it should be highly organized, though controlled from below. I mean, anything complex
*  is going to have to have some degree of representative decision-making, but always under
*  direct control and recall and so on. So it's kind of a pure democracy, if you want.
*  In fact, the major achievement of mainly anarcho-syndicalist
*  development was libertarian Spain. And it didn't have a lot of time. It was wiped out pretty soon.
*  But what developed rather quickly was a fairly organized society with a lot of interaction
*  between agriculture and industry and communities and so on. Pretty successful economically, too.
*  Now, libertarian socialists traditionally insist that the organizational structure of our
*  organizations must prefigure the desired society. So, for instance, if we want a
*  direct democratic society, then we should use direct democracy here and now. Why is that so
*  important? Well, the traditional idea goes back to Bakunin, is that you should, the way to carry out
*  social change is to build the seeds of the future within the present society.
*  To try to, I mean, what's really involved in social progress ultimately is a kind of change
*  of consciousness. Not just organization, but just letting different values and different
*  concerns come to prevail. And the way that happens is through participation in action,
*  not by reading about it. And one of the ways to do it is to start with direct democracy where you
*  are. And that's a lot of ideas about how to do this. I mean, work sharing, lots of possible
*  decision making, common decision making. And that helps. It's essential. I agree with this. It's
*  essential for gaining an understanding of what a free democratic society might be like, even if it's
*  a small group, let's say a publishing house with 10 people. And you learn, you experiment,
*  you see what works, what doesn't work. You can go on to bigger things. If one was to build a
*  libertarian socialist organization, what would be the core features of it? What would be the core
*  elements? Well, core elements, first of all, would be authentic participation. That means
*  everybody, not one person's a secretary, one person's a janitor, one person does the finance,
*  and therefore you automatically get a hierarchy of decision making based on
*  a role in the system. But really participating. That doesn't mean everybody can do everything.
*  I can't be a surgeon, somebody else can. But it means that in anything that involves
*  decision making functions, it should really be shared. It should be true in, say, universities,
*  like where I am, or publishing houses, or factories, or anywhere else. That's the beginning.
*  And as soon as you do that, it just breaks down barriers among people.
*  For one thing, it means there is some kinds of work that nobody wants to do, but it has to be
*  done. Well, that has to be shared. If that's not shared, then you've got a problem. But that can
*  be instituted. The joint participation decision making can be instituted. If there is representation,
*  immediate recall under public cooperative action. All of these things can be instituted on very small
*  scale and can spread to larger ones. And that, if it goes far enough, becomes a major organization.
*  Well, let me begin by referring to something that I've already discussed. That is, if it is
*  correct, as I believe it is, that a fundamental element of human nature is the need for
*  creative work, for creative inquiry, for free creation without the arbitrary limiting effects
*  of coercive institutions, then of course it will follow that a decent society should maximize the
*  possibilities for this fundamental human characteristic to be realized. That means trying
*  to overcome the elements of repression and oppression and destruction and coercion that
*  exist in any existing society, ours for example, as a historical residue. Now a federated,
*  decentralized system of free associations incorporating economic as well as social
*  institutions would be what I refer to as anarcho-syndicalism. And it seems to me that
*  it is the appropriate form of social organization for an advanced technological society in which
*  human beings do not have to be forced into the position of tools, of cogs in a machine, in which
*  the creative urge that I think is intrinsic to human nature will in fact be able to realize itself
*  in whatever way it will. I don't know all the ways in which it will. Anarchism can be conceived as a
*  kind of voluntary socialism that is a libertarian socialist or anarcho-syndicalist or communist
*  anarchist in the tradition of say Bakunin and Kropotkin and others had in mind a highly
*  organized form of society, but a society that was organized on the basis of
*  organic units, organic communities, and generally they meant by that the workplace or the neighborhood
*  or both. And from those two basic units involving the place where a person works and spends his
*  creative energies and the place where he lives in relation to his neighbors and others around him,
*  from those two basic units there could derive through federal arrangements a highly integrated
*  kind of social organization which might be national or even international in scope,
*  where decisions could be made over a substantial range, but by delegates who are always part of the
*  organic community from which they come and are returned to it and are revocable and in general
*  would live there in fact. So it doesn't mean a society in which there is literally speaking no
*  government so much as a society in which the primary authority and source of authority comes
*  as it were from the bottom up and not exactly from the top down where representative democracy
*  as we have it in the United States and in Britain would be regarded as a form of
*  from the top down authority even though ultimately the voters decide. Well representative democracy
*  as in say the United States of Great Britain would be criticized by an anarchist of this school on
*  really two grounds. First of all because there is a monopoly of power centralized in the state and
*  secondly and critically because representative democracy is limited to the political sphere
*  and in no way in a serious way encroaches on the economic sphere and anarchists of this tradition
*  have always held that democratic control of one's productive life is at the core of any
*  serious human liberation or for that matter any significant democratic practice. That is as long
*  as individuals are compelled to rent themselves on the market to those who are willing to
*  to hire them and as long as their role in production is simply that of ancillary tools
*  then there are striking elements of coercion and oppression that make talk of democracy very
*  limited if even meaningful. Then these precedents suggest that the there is something inherently
*  pre-industrial about the applicability of libertarian ideas in this way that it necessarily
*  presupposes a rather rural simple society in which the technologies production are fairly simple in
*  which the economic organization tends to be small scale and localized and in which all the problems
*  which we associate with modern industrial society just aren't there. Well let me separate that into
*  two questions one how anarchists have felt about that and and two what I think is the case.
*  As far as anarchist reactions to that there are two. There has been an anarchist tradition which was
*  and one might think say of Kropotkin as a representative which was which had much of the
*  character that you describe. On the other hand there's another anarchist tradition that develops
*  into anarcho-syndicalism which simply regarded anarchist ideas as the proper mode of organization
*  for a highly complex advanced industrial society and that tendency in anarchism
*  merges or at least interrelates very closely with a variety of left-wing Marxism. The kind that
*  one finds in say the council communists that grew up in the Luxembourgian tradition and that
*  is later represented by by Marxist theorists like say Anton Panacuk and
*  well who developed a whole theory of workers councils in industry as the and who was himself
*  a scientist and astronomer very much part of the industrial world of Dutch Marxist. Now
*  it's the latter. So which of these two views is correct? I mean is it necessary that anarchist
*  concepts belong to the pre-industrial phase of human society or is it the rational mode of
*  organization for a highly advanced industrial society? Well I myself believe the latter. That
*  is I think that industrialization and the advance of technology raises possibilities for
*  self-management over a broad scale that simply didn't exist in an earlier period
*  and that in fact this is precisely the rational mode for a an advanced and complex industrial
*  society. One in which workers can very well become masters of their own immediate affairs,
*  that is direction and control of the shop, but also can be in a position to make to make the
*  major substantive decisions concerning the structure of the economy, concerning social
*  institutions, concerning planning regionally and beyond because they can have in fact objectively
*  now that is technology permits and industrialization permits institutions do not permit them to have
*  control over the requisite information, the relevant training to understand these matters.
*  A good deal can be automated. Much of the necessary work that is required to keep
*  a decent level of social life going can be really consigned to machines, at least in principle,
*  which means humans can be free to undertake the kind of creative work which may not have been
*  possible objectively in early stages of the industrial revolution. I'd like to pursue in a
*  moment the question of the economics of an anarchist society, but could you sketch in a
*  little more broadly the kind of political constitution of an anarchist society as you
*  would see it in modern conditions? Would there be political parties for example? What forms of
*  government residual forms of government would in fact remain? Well as let me sketch what a kind of
*  what I think would be perhaps a rough consensus and one that I think is essentially correct,
*  beginning with these two modes of immediate organization and control, namely organization
*  and control in the workplace and in the community, one can imagine a network of
*  workers councils at a higher level representation across the factory or across branches of industry
*  or across crafts and on to general assemblies of workers councils that can be regional
*  and national and international in character. And from another point of view one can project
*  a system of governance that involves local assemblies, again federated regionally dealing
*  with regional issues, crossing crafts, industries, trades and so on, and again general at the level
*  of the nation or beyond through federation and so on. Now each of these and exactly how these
*  would develop and how they would inter inter interrelate and whether you need both of them or
*  only one, well these are matters over which anarchist theoreticians have debated and and many
*  detailed proposals exist and I don't I don't feel competent to take a stand. In fact I think these
*  are questions that pretty much would have to be worked out. But there would not for example be
*  direct national elections and political parties organized from coast to coast as it were off
*  from north to south in Britain to win those kind of elections. Would that because if there were
*  that would create a kind of a central authority which would be well I'd call to the idea of
*  anarchism. No the idea of anarchism is that delegation of authority is rather minimal.
*  That is participants at any one of these levels of government, representatives at any one of these
*  levels of government should be directly responsive to the organic community in which they live.
*  In fact the optimal situation would be that participation in one of these
*  levels of government should on the one hand be temporary and even during the period when
*  it's taking place should be only partial. That is the members of a workers council who are for some
*  period actually functioning to make short-run decisions that other people don't want to don't
*  have the time to make should nevertheless be in part also continuing to do their work as part of
*  the workplace or neighborhood community in which they belong. Now as for political parties
*  my feeling is that an anarchist society would not forcefully present prevent physical political
*  parties from from arising. In fact anarchism has always been based on the idea that any
*  sort of procrustian bed any any sort of system of norms that's imposed on social life will
*  will constrain and very much underestimate its its energy and vitality and that all sorts of new
*  possibilities of voluntary organization may develop that we may not even think of today at
*  that higher level of the material and intellectual culture. But I think it is fair to say that
*  insofar as political parties are felt to be necessary anarchist organization of society will
*  have failed. That is it should be the case I would think that where there is direct participation
*  in self-management in economic and social affairs then factions conflicts differences of interest
*  and and idea and opinion which should be welcomed and cultivated will be expressed at every one of
*  these levels. Why they should fall into two or three or in political parties I don't quite see.
*  I think that the complexity of human interest in and life is that does not fall in that fashion.
*  Parties represent basically class interests or largely classes would not exist and classes would
*  have been eliminated or transcended in such a society. Historically have there been any
*  sustained examples on any substantial scale of societies which approximated to the anarchist
*  idea. There are small societies a smaller number that have I think done so quite well and there are
*  a few examples of large-scale libertarian revolutions which were largely anarchist in
*  their structure. As to the first small societies extending over a long period I myself think the
*  most dramatic example is perhaps the Israeli kibbutzim which for a long period may or may not be
*  true today really were constructed on anarchist principles that is of direct worker control
*  integration of agriculture industry service personal life on an egalitarian basis with
*  direct and in fact quite active participation in self-management and were I should think
*  extraordinarily successful. A good example of a really large-scale anarchist revolution or largely
*  anarchist revolution in fact the best example to my knowledge is the Spanish revolution in 1936
*  and in fact you can't tell what would happen that anarchist revolution was simply destroyed by force
*  but during the period in which it was alive I think it was inspiring testimony to the ability of
*  poor working people to organize manage their affairs extremely successfully without coercion
*  and control. How far does the success of libertarian socialism or anarchism as a way of life
*  really depend on a fundamental change in the nature of man both in his motivation his altruism
*  and also in his knowledge and sophistication. I think it not only depends on it but in fact
*  the whole purpose of libertarian socialism is that it will contribute to it. It will contribute to
*  a spiritual transformation precisely that kind of great transformation in the way humans
*  conceive of themselves and their ability to act to decide to create to produce to inquire precisely
*  that spiritual transformation that social thinkers from the left marxist tradition from lexen
*  luxenberg say on over through anarcho-syndicalists have always emphasized. So on the one hand it
*  requires that spiritual transformation on the other hand the its purpose is to create institutions
*  which will contribute to that transformation.
