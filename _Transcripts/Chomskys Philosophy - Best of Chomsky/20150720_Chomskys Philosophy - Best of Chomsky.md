# Noam Chomsky - Globalization
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [July 20, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RxHzQTHhKk)
*  Globalization. First of all, what is it? I mean globalization, used
*  neutrally, globalization just means international integration. Okay,
*  everybody's in favor of it. I mean it's been the core principle of the left and
*  the working-class movement since their origins. That's why every union is called
*  an international. Okay, everybody's in favor of globalization. Now the term has
*  been appropriated by a narrow sector of power and privilege to refer to their
*  version of international integration, the investor rights version, and that makes
*  sense for them to try to own the term because anyone who's
*  opposed to their version then becomes anti-globalization, meaning some kind of
*  primitive who wants to go back to the Stone Age or something like that. It's a
*  bad error on the part of the critics of this investor rights version of
*  integration to accept the term anti-globalization. They should not. We're
*  all in favor of globalization. The question is, is it going to be in
*  interest of people or in the interests of private power? But everybody's in
*  favor of it. Okay, like nobody's opposed to the fact that you can call up your
*  friend in Italy or something like that. That's integration. Right, now has
*  internet, just using the term neutrally now, what has it increased or has it
*  decreased? Well, you know, in many respects it's decreased. So if you look
*  at international economic integration, there are a lot of different measures. I
*  mean, I mentioned one. There's a technical measure which is convergence
*  towards the single price and wage, single market. Well, that's declining.
*  During the period of the last 25 years it's been declining. Furthermore, it's
*  predicted to decline even further. Okay, so the investor rights version of
*  globalization is predicted by its advocates to lead to less globalization
*  in the technical sense. More globalization in their sense means they
*  have control more of the wealth and power in the world. So that's one question.
*  Take what Adam Smith meant by it. Okay, I suppose to love Adam Smith. The core of
*  free trade, according to Adam Smith, is what he called free circulation of
*  labor, meaning people can go where they want. If you don't have that, you can't
*  begin to talk about free trade. Well, if we measure that, what's happened to
*  globalization? Well, it turns out the peak period was about over a century ago.
*  Relative to population, the ability of people to move around was higher then
*  than it's ever been since. Not for pretty reasons, incidentally. I don't mean that
*  the reasons were nice. The reasons were that people who were fleeing the
*  horrors of the Industrial Revolution in Europe could come to the United
*  States and massacre the population and take over their lands. Okay, like it
*  wasn't a pretty reason, but the fact just in terms of movement of people across
*  borders is that it was higher then than it is now. I mean, that's why I'm, you
*  know, my parents didn't end up in a gas chamber, okay, because there was a lot of
*  globalization in the sense of movement across borders. That's declined. And in
*  fact, what has, on the other hand, other by other measures, globalization is
*  increased very fast, like movement of capital. So increase of capital flow
*  across borders has just increased, escalated astronomically in the last 25
*  years. Many international economists, mainstream ones, can assume, conclude
*  that that's a substantial part of the reason why the international, why the
*  performance of the international economy has been so poor in the last 25 years.
*  And it has by almost every macroeconomic measure. The performance of the economy
*  is worse in the past 25 years than it was in the preceding 25 years.
*  Considerably, the period that's called globalization the last 25 years has seen
*  a decline in just about everything. Rate of growth, rate of investment, even the
*  rate of growth of trade has declined in the last 25 years. And a lot of economists
*  attribute that to the increased financial volatility, the huge increase in
*  capital flows across borders. In fact, this period of globalization, what's
*  called globalization, the past 25 years was really initiated by the breakdown of
*  capital controls. The Bretton Woods system, the preceding 25 years, was based
*  on control of capital movements. You know, the countries could control capital
*  movements and currencies were regulated relative to one another within a pretty
*  narrow band, which cut back speculation. And that was a period of huge growth.
*  The period since has been much worse. So by that measure, freedom of movement
*  or say speculative speculation on against currencies, that kind of thing,
*  capital flow across foreign exchange movements, that's just escalated
*  enormously. So by that measure, there's more globalization. You measure by
*  people, less globalization, by capital movement, more globalization. In fact,
*  you see it very dramatically in the US Mexico relation. So the US Mexico border
*  is, of course, an artificial border like just about every border. It was established
*  by conquest. Okay, US conquered half of Mexico. That gives you the border.
*  That's been a very porous border throughout history. People go up and back
*  pretty freely in both directions for all kinds of reasons. It was militarized in
*  1994 under Clinton's Operation Gatekeeper that it was militarized in order to stop
*  the movement of people across the border. That is to cut back international
*  integration. Why in 1994? Well, because that was the year when NAFTA was
*  initiated. NAFTA is called, claimed to be something that increases integration
*  between Mexico and the United States, but not measured by people. It cuts back
*  the flow. That's why you had to militarize the border. Why did they want
*  to militarize the border? Well, because what they predicted in Mexico is what's
*  called an economic miracle from NAFTA, which means a disaster for most of the
*  population. What was predicted was that the effect of NAFTA on Mexico would be
*  devastating blow to the majority of the population, which has indeed happened.
*  Wages have dropped precipitously. Hundreds of thousands of people driven
*  off the land. Investment has declined, though foreign investment has increased.
*  And in general, it's been a kind of economic miracle. Economic miracle means
*  that for a small sector, wealthy people, and for foreign investors, it's fantastic.
*  That's the definition of a miracle. For most of the population, it's been
*  awful. And they expected that, and that's why you had to militarize the border.
*  So did that increase integration or decrease it? Well, you know, it's an
*  ideological question. It depends what you want to measure. When you militarize a
*  border to prevent people from moving freely, by Adam Smith's measure, it
*  decreases it. Okay, by the measure of, you know, the owners of the economy,
*  it increases it. They make more profit. What about trade? You know, everybody
*  reads the trade increased between Mexico and the United States. Did it?
*  Well, not by Adam Smith's measures. Before NAFTA, you know, in 1993,
*  there was plenty of so-called, there was plenty of movement of commodities
*  across the border. But about 50% of it was internal to a firm. Okay, that's not
*  trade. Okay, at least by classical economic measures, that's no more trade
*  than if General Motors moved something from Indiana to Illinois. You know, if
*  internal to a totalitarian institution, a command economy, you move something and
*  it happens across a border, that's not trade in any meaningful sense. Well, it
*  was 50% before NAFTA, now it's about 66%. So what about actual trade? You know,
*  trade in some meaningful sense. Well, you know, nobody's measured it, but I wouldn't
*  be surprised if it's declined. We all know that it's even grown, even as fast as it
*  was growing before. And intra-firm transfers are only a small part of centrally managed
*  interactions. There's also what are called strategic alliances, you know, like IBM
*  and Toshiba make some deal. Or there's what's called outsourcing. When a
*  corporation uses some small non-unionized outfit somewhere to make things very
*  cheaply and they don't have to worry about wages and benefits, but they control it.
*  And if it happens across borders, that's still centrally managed. Well, there
*  haven't been any really careful analyses that I'm aware of, but the few studies
*  that have been done, one by I think Brookings Institution, estimated that around 70%
*  of cross-border interactions are probably centrally managed in one fashion or another.
*  You know, intra-firm or strategic alliances or, you know, outsourcing or other devices.
*  Actually, you could only get answers to this, one, if anybody studied it, and nobody studies
*  it. And two, if you could get into the, it's the old question, former question, if you
*  could get into the internal workings of the totalitarian institutions that are running
*  the command economies that are running it. But these estimates are probably in somewhere in
*  the right ballpark, which means that very little of what's going on across borders is trade in any
*  serious sense. Some things have definitely declined, like movement of people. In the case of NAFTA,
*  not just by accident, by militarizing the border. Just a day or two ago,
*  Bush announced further militarization of the border. That's cutting back international
*  integration. I mean, pretext is drugs, but that's pretext for anything.
*  So you just can't answer these questions simply about globalization. There's just too many
*  different ways of looking at it. If you look at it from the point of view of people's interests,
*  looks very different than if you look at it from the point of view of investors' interests. Just
*  totally different. Will there be a change over the future? Well, you know, that's, nobody can predict
*  human affairs at all. Too much depends on what people like you decide to do. It's a question of
*  will and choice.
