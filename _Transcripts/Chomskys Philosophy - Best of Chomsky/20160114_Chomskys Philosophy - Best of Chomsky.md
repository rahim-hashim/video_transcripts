# Noam Chomsky - Speaking Truth to Power
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [January 14, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEGUuR8aO7g)
*  Playing what he called Devil's Advocate, Bertrand Russell wrote in the 1950s that the fate of the world depends on, I quote,
*  the decisions of Khrushchev, Mao, and Dulles. Dulles was Secretary of State of the United States under Eisenhower at that time.
*  Russell added, they do not read our books and would find them very silly if they did.
*  Things have changed since then, but the power is still concentrated in the hands of relatively few people,
*  at the head of the IMF, the World Bank, the Pentagon, the World Trade Organization, etc.
*  What difference do you think people like you or us can make?
*  In case you reply that the general public has an influence on leaders, the same question arises. Do they read our books?
*  Well, the Russell quote makes sense. It's a good response to a slogan that's familiar among activists.
*  It's actually a slogan used by some of my close friends in the activist movement, particularly the Quaker activists.
*  They're very good, very courageous people, constantly engaged, not only in protest but in resistance, civil disobedience.
*  And their slogan is that you have to speak truth to power.
*  And Russell's response, I think, is an apt response to the idea that you should speak truth to power.
*  There's no point speaking truth to Stalin, Khrushchev, Mao and Dulles. They don't want to hear it or they know it.
*  But I think we shouldn't accept the slogan in the first place for many reasons.
*  For one thing, Russell's reasons. For another thing, that's not our audience, as John pointed out.
*  It's people who can create conditions under which the leadership is compelled to make decisions.
*  Actually, we've seen that in what's being called the Arab Spring.
*  Even the dictators have to respond to organized public opinion.
*  It's plainly much more true in more free societies.
*  And it's not just a matter of influencing leaders but also throwing them out, replacing them, in fact, eliminating leadership altogether.
*  So power is the wrong audience. The audience is people who can influence power or assume power.
*  Also, the idea of speaking truth to them doesn't seem to capture the right concept.
*  For one thing, who are we to speak truth? Do we have some special insight into the truth?
*  I mean, we do our best. Other people do their best.
*  So you should be speaking what you best, presenting your best understanding of complex affairs of the world and human life.
*  And you shouldn't be speaking to them.
*  Ideally, what you should be doing is what a good teacher should be doing, speaking with them, interacting with them, learning from them, as is constantly the case in serious dialogue.
*  So the right idea should be speaking with people who are part of the general public, concerned and committed to improving, changing, maybe overthrowing structures of power and dominance,
*  and learning with them, encouraging them to, using what resources you have.
*  Most of us are, we're privileged, so we have access to resources, to training and so on, and that can contribute to popular movements.
*  It always does. But also learning from them.
*  Well, Jean asked, do they need our books? Well, that's up to them.
*  Actually, I think they probably do. At least they devour them.
*  And it has an effect, and there's an interacting effect. It changes the kind of things one writes and speaks.
*  So I think, though I kind of agree with the criticism, I think it's not directed to the true issues at hand.
