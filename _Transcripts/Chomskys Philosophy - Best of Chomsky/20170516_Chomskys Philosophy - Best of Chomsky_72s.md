# Noam Chomsky - The Mafia Principle
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 16, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfi0Lafoucc)
*  I think with all the fancy talk in international relations theory, there's only one principle
*  that I know of that seems to me to have any merit, and that's the Mafia principle.
*  International relations is very much like the Mafia.
*  The Godfather does not accept disobedience.
*  And for, you know, like if a small storekeeper, it doesn't matter if it's an important country
*  or not.
*  So suppose some small storekeeper doesn't pay his protection money.
*  Well, the Godfather doesn't just send out his goons to pick up the money.
*  He sends out the goons to beat them to a pulp so that others will understand that disobedience
*  is not acceptable.
*  And we have a rich documentary record.
*  I mentioned a little of it, but there's plenty more to show that that's been a guiding principle
*  of great power politics anywhere you look.
*  And it's an understandable principle.
*  Of course, there's a task of intellectuals.
*  And that's to write editorials like the one I quoted in the Boston Globe, which is universal.
*  I don't want to dump on them.
*  Our noble efforts aren't working, so let's try something else.
*  But if you look at the record, that's the Mafia principle.
