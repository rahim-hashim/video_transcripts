# Noam Chomsky - Really Existing Capitalism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [July 21, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9XFBN5X1JU)
*  Capitalism would self-destruct.
*  And that's why it hasn't been instituted.
*  The masters understand that they cannot survive a capitalist economy,
*  unless a fair economy.
*  You take a look at the history, it's pretty interesting.
*  So the United States, when it was independent,
*  so it could reject the rules of sound economics and develop,
*  there were other countries that were poised for industrial revolution
*  and were given the same advice, like Egypt and India.
*  In fact, India already was the commercial industrial center of the world,
*  more so than England.
*  Egypt was poised for an industrial revolution.
*  And it's not impossible that it might have developed.
*  It was a rich agrarian society.
*  It had cotton, produced cotton, as I say,
*  that's the main product, like oil today.
*  And it didn't need slaves, it had peasants.
*  It had a developmental government aimed at industrial development.
*  It could have taken off, just as India could have taken off.
*  But they were not free to reject sound economics,
*  because they were ruled by British force.
*  So they were forced to accept sound economics.
*  And Egypt became Egypt, and the United States became the United States.
*  India went through a century of de-development,
*  until it finally got independence.
*  That's what happens when you apply laissez-faire principles.
*  In fact, that's essentially how the third world and the first world divided.
*  Take a look at the countries that developed.
*  They're the countries who violated the principles.
*  England, the United States, Germany, France, the Netherlands.
*  One country of the south, one country developed, Japan,
*  the one country that wasn't colonized
*  and was able to pursue the same course that the rich countries developed.
*  I mentioned that in mid-19th century, 1846,
*  Britain was so far ahead of the rest of the world in industrial development
*  that they did decide that laissez-faire would be possible.
*  So they moved to what's called the free trade era.
*  First of all, they imposed sharp constraints on it.
*  They cut off India.
*  India was not allowed to, others could not invest in India, their main possession.
*  And India was not allowed to develop.
*  There were other restrictions.
*  Pretty soon, British capitalists called the game off because they couldn't compete.
*  By the 1920s, they couldn't compete with Japanese production.
*  So they literally closed off the empire to Japanese exports.
*  That's part of the background for the Pacific War in the 1940s.
*  The United States did the same with its smaller empire, the Philippines.
*  The Dutch did the same with Indonesia.
*  All the imperial systems decided no more free trade, we can't compete.
*  So they closed off the empire, meaning Japan had no markets, no resources, and they went to work.
*  That's a large part of the background.
*  The United States in 1945 did move towards laissez-faire.
*  In fact, there was an important conference.
*  The United States was basically running the world at that point for obvious reasons.
*  There was a hemispheric conference called by Washington, February 1945, in Mexico,
*  where the Western Hemisphere was compelled to adopt an economic charter for the Americas,
*  which banned any interference with market principles.
*  The goal was, you read the State Department reports, to oppose the new nationalism in Latin America,
*  which is based on the idea that the people of a country should benefit from the country's resources.
*  That's evil, can't allow that.
*  It's Western and U.S. investors who have to benefit from their resources.
*  So that was the economic charter of the Americas imposed on the countries of the hemisphere, with one exception here.
*  The United States did not follow those policies.
*  Quite the contrary, as I mentioned.
*  There was a massive development of a state-based economy with an industrial policy,
*  the kind that created the modern high-tech economy.
*  You can see it right across the river.
*  Take a look at MIT, one of the main centers of this.
*  If you looked at MIT in the 1950s, when I got there,
*  it was surrounded by electronics-based high-tech firms like Raytheon and ITech, huge IT firms.
*  Take a look at MIT today, take a look at the buildings.
*  It's Novartis, Pfizer, and so on.
*  The reason is completely obvious.
*  During the 50s and 60s, the cutting edge of the economy was electronics-based.
*  So the way to get the public to pay for it was to scream Russians
*  and to get them to pay higher taxes for the Pentagon.
*  And then the Pentagon would fund the research and development, like my own salary, for example.
*  I shouldn't complain too much.
*  And of course, private, so-called private industry was around there,
*  like vultures, to pick up the products and the research and dismarket it.
*  Well, since the 70s, the cutting edge of the economy has been moving towards being biology-based.
*  So government funding has shifted.
*  Pentagon funding is declining.
*  Funding from the NIH and other so-called health-related government institutions is increasing.
*  And the private corporations understand that.
*  So now Novartis, genetic engineering firms and so on are hanging around,
*  trying to pick up the research that you're paying for so that they can market it and make profits.
*  It's just transparent. It's in front of our eyes.
*  And it takes a very effective educational system to prevent people from seeing it.
*  It's virtually transparent.
*  That's the way really existing capitalist democracy works.
