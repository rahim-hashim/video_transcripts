# Noam Chomsky - Conformity and Control
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [July 08, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N11tcnPBwf4)
*  The mass media are in the first place major corporations.
*  You know, that's what they are.
*  They are some of the biggest corporations in the country.
*  And they're closely interlocked with other corporations.
*  In fact, they are part of the small network of individuals and interests
*  which effectively own the private economy and staff the state executive.
*  If you look at the people who hold the high planning positions in the state executive under any administration,
*  they come from corporate boardrooms, investment banks, half a dozen law firms that cater to corporate interests and so on.
*  There are a number of studies of this if you're interested.
*  That's the same group of people, the same interests who own the media.
*  So naturally they share a perception of the world and general interests.
*  That's at the top level.
*  Now I suppose you get down to the editorial level, the reporters level.
*  Well, you know, at that point you find pressures to conform.
*  A young journalist will quickly learn that certain things are reportable and other things aren't.
*  You can say things in a certain way and you can't say things in other ways.
*  And you learn it from your editors or the people right above you.
*  And they've learned it from the people right above them.
*  Remember corporations are the private equivalent of what we call fascism in the political realm.
*  The decision making structure in a corporation is top down.
*  You give orders and they get executed by down below and so on and so forth.
*  And the orders ultimately come from the owners.
*  Furthermore, the media have a market.
*  That market is other corporations.
*  The media, the market for the media is advertisers.
*  Remember the media do not make their money on sales to you and me.
*  In fact, every purchase of a newspaper or journal usually costs them money.
*  Right? That's the way the political economy of the media work.
*  Their market is advertisers, which imposes yet another constraint.
*  They want to maintain a relationship to the state, which is their friends.
*  You know, there's a kind of inner penetration up and back.
*  In fact, even the individuals flow up and back.
*  You know, Bernard Kalb, Leslie Gelb, etc., etc.
*  Of course they flow up and back because they represent the same interests.
*  There's a constant flow between corporate boardrooms, state managers, media executives and top level media people,
*  university elites who play the game by the rules and so on.
*  They all belong to the same privileged elite.
*  They all benefit the same way.
*  They perceive the world the same way.
*  If any of them get out of line, they're excluded.
*  And that can happen even at a very high level.
*  So for example, a couple of years ago, the top editorial staff of the New York Times was essentially thrown out,
*  John Oakes and others, because they were beginning to deviate a little bit.
*  And if you look at the mechanisms, it's very clear.
*  I think there's about the mid-70s.
*  There began to be reports in the business press, the Wall Street Journal, the Business Week,
*  noting, pointing out subtly that New York Times stock was declining on the stock market.
*  They pointed out, I hear I'm quoting, they said,
*  if the New York Times doesn't realize that it's a business, soon it won't be in business any longer.
*  Well, and in fact they did replace a good part of the top editorial board at that time.
*  What was the great crime that the New York Times was committing at that point?
*  Well, if you look back, it turns out that they were editorially supporting some very mild fiscal reform measures
*  that business didn't happen to like.
*  And that was enough to set in motion the technique of control.
*  You'll notice that the state is under exactly the same technique of control in a capitalist democracy.
*  Suppose that the state, in fact, is staffed by those heavy resources.
*  But suppose it tried to deviate.
*  Suppose it started to pursue policies that didn't conform to the interests of those who make the investment decisions,
*  who essentially own the place.
*  Well, what would happen, in fact does happen, is a decline in investment, the beginning of capital flight,
*  just a little bit, enough to tell them that the country is going to go down the tube unless they go back to the main course.
*  Now, what that means is that when true decision-making power is in private hands,
*  the political system is marginal and the ideological institutions are limited.
*  And incidentally, these conditions almost never arise because they're all staffed by people with the same interests
*  and the same background and the same perception anyway.
*  Getting back again to the reporter, they just shape up or else they're out.
*  And what typically, incidentally this happens in universities too.
*  Those of you who are going on in the ideological professions, the social sciences and so on, you'll learn this.
*  You'll learn that you've got to conform.
*  Now, it's not 100 percent.
*  The system is willing to tolerate statistical error.
*  But it's got to be enough so that there isn't any significant deviation.
*  And you do come under pressures to conform, all sorts of pressures.
*  You'll find out what they are if you don't know already.
*  And those pressures are effective.
*  What they do is weed out independent people.
*  And for the people who decide to conform...
*  There's also something very interesting which you might as well be aware of if you haven't faced it yet because it'll happen.
*  What happens is that if you decide, well, I'll conform a little.
*  You know, I'll do what they say, but I'll keep my independence of mind.
*  As soon as you begin to do that, you're lost unless you're a very rare individual.
*  Because what happens is you begin to conform.
*  You begin to get the privilege of conformity.
*  You soon come to believe what you're saying because it's useful to believe it.
*  And then you've internalized the system of indoctrination and distortion and deception.
*  And then you're a willing member of the privileged elites that control thought and indoctrination.
*  That happens all the time, all the way to the top.
*  I mean, it's a very rare person, very rare, almost to the point of non-existence,
*  who can tolerate what's called cognitive dissonance, you know, saying one thing and believing another.
*  You start saying certain things because it's necessary to say them and pretty soon you're believing them because you just have to.
*  There is no atrocity, in my view, that we know of that has been carried out in the world that wasn't justified by its perpetrators as highly moral.
*  That includes, incidentally, Nazi genocide.
*  You read Himmler's diaries to go to the sort of extreme.
*  And it's all full of how noble this is and how much strength it requires and so on and so forth.
*  Slavery was justified by the slave owners with moral arguments.
*  If we had records from Matilda the Hun, we'd probably find out that what he was doing was highly moral.
*  You know, same with Stalin and every mass murderer in history.
*  And it happens at a much lower level for individuals.
*  Incidentally, you're all familiar with this from your personal lives and it's worth bearing in mind.
*  So like there, I doubt if there's anybody here who hasn't done pretty rotten things in their life at some time.
*  But I also am willing to bet that every one of you has figured out a way to make that exactly the right and moral and proper thing to do.
*  Okay? And that's what happens when you go, when you become parts of institutions too.
*  So that's the way the indoctrination works on the participants.
*  And it ends up being a very effective system, ultimately rooted in control over resources, exactly as you'd expect.
*  It's not very mysterious.
*  Some people talk about it as this is a conspiracy theory.
*  That's really idiotic. It's not a conspiracy.
*  Like if the board of managers of General Motors decides to maximize profit, that's not a conspiracy.
*  In fact, if they didn't do it, they'd be thrown out.
*  That's the institutional role they have to play.
*  And the ideological institutions also have a role that they have to play within a nexus of institutions.
*  And if they don't play that role or if individuals within them don't play that role, they'll be replaced by others who do.
*  Because these are institutional facts like the arms race.
