# Noam Chomsky - Constraint and Creativity
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [July 26, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X-AkJZUIiE)
*  One consequence of your theories is that we are as human beings very very rigidly
*  pre-programmed. There are certain things we can understand, certain things we can
*  communicate, and anything that falls outside that we simply can't. Is that so?
*  That's certainly correct. So I mean in a way this is a rather alarming doctrine. I
*  mean it it it certainly contravenes the way we want to feel about ourselves. Well
*  maybe an immediate reaction but I think it's it's not the correct reaction. In
*  fact while it's true that our genetic program rigidly constrains us, I think
*  the more important point is that the existence of that rigid
*  constraint is what provides the basis for our freedom and creativity.
*  What you mean it's only because we're pre-programmed that we can do all the things we can do?
*  Exactly. The point is that if we really were plastic organisms without an
*  extensive pre-programming, then the state that our mind achieves would in fact be
*  a reflection of the environment, which means it would be extraordinarily
*  impoverished. Fortunately for us we are rigidly pre-programmed with extremely
*  rich systems that are part of our biological endowment. Correspondingly a
*  small amount of rather degenerate experience allows a kind of a great leap
*  into a rich cognitive system, essentially uniform in a community and in fact
*  roughly uniform. Which would have developed over countless evolutionary
*  ages through the biological evolutionary process. Well the basic system itself
*  developed over long periods of evolutionary development. We don't know
*  how really, but for the individual it's present. As a result the individual is
*  capable of, with a very small amount of evidence, of constructing an extremely
*  rich system which allows him to act in the free and creative fashion which in
*  fact is normal for humans. We can say anything that we want over an infinite
*  range. Other people will understand us though they've heard nothing like that
*  before. We're able to do that precisely because of that rigid programming. But
*  short of that we would not be able to do at all. What account are you able to give
*  of creativity if we are pre-programmed in the way you say, then how is
*  creativity a possibility for us? Well here I think one has to be fairly careful. I
*  think we can say a good deal about the nature of the system that is
*  acquired, the state of knowledge that is attained. We can say a fair amount about
*  the biological basis, the basis in the initial state of the mind for
*  the acquisition of this system. But when we turn to a third question, namely how
*  is this system used? How are we able to act creatively? How do we decide to,
*  how can we decide to say things that are new but not random, that are appropriate
*  to occasions but not under the control of stimuli? When we ask these questions we
*  really enter into a realm of mystery where human science, at least so far and
*  maybe in principle, does not reach. We can say a fair amount about the principles
*  that make it possible for us to behave in our normal creative fashion. But as
*  soon as questions of will or decision or reason or choice of action, when those
*  questions arise, human science is at a loss. It has nothing to say about them as
*  far as I can see. These questions remain in the obscurity in which they were in
*  classical antiquity. Would you also accept this or not, that having arrived
*  at our present situation across millions of years of evolution, we must have been
*  going through a continual process of innovation and new adaption and
*  development of new abilities, dispositions, organs, etc. Might we not
*  still be, as it were, plastic at the edges? Might we not still be developing and
*  genuinely evolving, if only on the margin? Well I think one has to be again
*  very cautious here because while it's true in a very vague sense,
*  it's correct to say that the systems that we now have have developed through
*  evolution and through natural selection, it's important to recognize how little
*  we are saying when we say that. For example, it is certainly not necessarily
*  the case that every particular trait that we have is the result of specific
*  selection, that is that we were selected for having that. In fact, there are striking
*  examples to the contrary, or at least apparent examples to the contrary. Say,
*  take for example our capacity to deal with abstract properties of the number
*  system, and that's a distinctive human capacity, as distinctive as the capacity
*  for language. Any normal human, in fact, down to pathological levels, can
*  comprehend the properties of the number system and can move very far in
*  understanding their deep properties. But it's extremely difficult to believe that
*  this capacity was the result of specific selection, that is it's hard to believe
*  that people who were a little better at proving theorems of number theory had
*  more children, let's say. That didn't happen. In fact, through most of human
*  evolution, in fact essentially all of human evolution, this capacity wasn't, it
*  would have been impossible to know that this capacity even existed. The
*  contingencies that allowed it to be exercised never arose. Nevertheless, the
*  trait is there, the capacity is there, the mental organ, if you like, has
*  developed. Presumably it has developed as a concomitant of some other properties
*  of the brain which may have been selected. For example, we can speculate,
*  say, that increase in brain size was a factor in differential reproduction,
*  hence in evolution. And it may be that for physical law, because of physical
*  laws that we presently don't know, that an increase in brain size under the
*  specific conditions of human evolution simply leads necessarily to a system
*  which has the capacity to deal with properties of the number system. Well,
*  then that's a matter of physics ultimately. And then the mind that evolves,
*  the brain that evolves, will have this capacity, but not because it was
*  achieved through selection. Now, I think it's at least likely that something of
*  the sort is true of human language. I mean, surely if it were dysfunctional,
*  it wouldn't have been maintained. It's obviously functional. But it's a long
*  leap to claim that the specific structures of language are themselves
*  the result of specific selection. And it's a leap that I don't think is
*  particularly plausible.
