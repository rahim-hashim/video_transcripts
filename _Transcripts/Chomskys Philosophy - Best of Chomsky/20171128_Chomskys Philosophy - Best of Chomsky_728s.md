# Noam Chomsky - Thought and Creativity
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [November 28, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWXIBJ2640s)
*  What I'd like to know is why the study of how we acquire language was important to you
*  and what has it revealed to us in a broad sense about how the mind works?
*  Well, traditionally the capacity for language has been understood to be almost a defining property of the human species.
*  If you go back, say, to the Cartesian philosophy, the 17th century dominant philosophy,
*  out of which grew the Enlightenment and so on, for Descartes it literally was the defining property.
*  Remember, for Descartes it was critical to distinguish creatures with minds,
*  or minds from those who didn't have them.
*  The ones who didn't have souls and minds were machines.
*  That was the mechanical philosophy that was the basis for early modern science.
*  They were machines. Those with souls and minds were human.
*  Well, how would you determine whether some creature has a mind?
*  The proposals that come from Descartes and his followers were by testing their language abilities.
*  You ask, do they have this fundamental creative capacity that humans have
*  and that they exhibit in their normal use of language?
*  What's the creative capacity? I think they captured the essence of it pretty accurately.
*  It's the ability which all humans share, and according to them no animal or machine shares,
*  to create and produce freely new expressions which are appropriate to situations,
*  but not caused by situations. They're not the result of stimuli coming from the outside,
*  or for that matter even internal stimuli.
*  There's a big difference between being caused and being appropriate.
*  It's a crucial difference, a hard one to capture, but we recognize it.
*  This innovative behavior has no limits. It can go on indefinitely.
*  In fact, most linguistic performances, new sentences, may be never produced in the history of the world,
*  or in your own experience at least.
*  They're also intelligible to others who recognize,
*  I could have expressed that thought in that way if it had come to mind.
*  Well, that capacity, sort of a creative aspect of language use, was regarded,
*  and I think plausibly, as a kind of a core component of human cognition, human morality, moral judgment,
*  and in fact human activity.
*  This was connected, especially in the early days of classical liberalism,
*  people like Smith, von Humboldt and others.
*  This was connected with the belief that humans basically have a need, a fundamental need,
*  to carry out creative work under their own control.
*  This was put very nicely by Wilhelm von Humboldt, the founder of the modern university system,
*  also a great linguist and one of the founders of classical liberalism.
*  His point was, the way he put it is that if an artisan creates a beautiful piece of work under on command,
*  we may admire what he did, but we despise what he is, namely a tool in the hands of others.
*  On the other hand, if that artisan produces the same beautiful work under his own control and initiative,
*  we admire not only the piece of work, but also the artisan himself, who it is.
*  Actually, Adam Smith said the same thing.
*  Everyone has read the first paragraph of Wealth of Nations, where it talks about the butcher does this,
*  and the baker does that, and everybody's happy.
*  It comes out in favor of division of labor.
*  Very few people have gone on a couple hundred pages into this rather dense book
*  when Smith returns to the notion of division of labor and says that division of labor cannot be tolerated
*  because it will turn people into creatures as stupid and ignorant as a human being can possibly be,
*  just routinely under command performing the same actions over and over.
*  He says in any civilized society, the government's going to have to step in to do something about it,
*  education, other things.
*  If you take a look at the scholarly editions of Wealth of Nations,
*  say the University of Chicago Bicentennial Scholarly Edition,
*  you take a look under division of labor, and you'll notice this passage isn't even listed in the index.
*  The most important passage about division of labor.
*  I'm sure it was not intended to seat. I think they just couldn't understand it.
*  It's just an unintelligible view in the modern conception.
*  You kind of read the words, but they don't get beyond the eyes.
*  But that conception is really fundamental to classical liberalism. I think it's correct.
*  They related it loosely to the creative aspect of language use.
*  Well, we're very far from having answers to any of these questions, I should say.
*  But there are steps towards it. And the major steps do happen to be in the study of language.
*  There are applications, thoughts about it elsewhere, but that's where the main work is.
*  And some rather surprising things have come out, I think.
*  It's sort of useful to compare what's been done in the last roughly 60 years
*  to the very early days of modern science.
*  One of the great breakthroughs in modern science, say Galileo, Galilean period,
*  was to be willing to be puzzled about things that seemed obvious.
*  That's a tremendous step forward.
*  So, for example, for literally thousands of years, it had been accepted by important scientists
*  that we have answers to some very simple questions.
*  Like when I hold this thing up, if I let it go, the cup's going to drop.
*  If this happened to be boiling water inside and I lift the lid, the steam will go up.
*  So the cup drops and the steam rises.
*  Well, Aristotle had an answer to why they're seeking their natural place.
*  And that was taken to be the appropriate answer for thousands of years
*  when Galileo and others began to say, let's be puzzled about this.
*  Let's just not take it for granted because it comes from authority.
*  And when you start being puzzled about it, modern science begins.
*  You see you don't know the answers.
*  And when you try to find out the answers, they break down.
*  It shows that all sorts of intuitions are just wildly off.
*  And you finally, out of this, slowly comes modern science.
*  And I think that's what's been happening in the study of language since roughly the early 1950s, approximately.
*  A lot of things that seemed completely obvious were looked at carefully,
*  and they all turned out to be extremely puzzling.
*  So I'll take a simple example, which has kind of evolved in the industry of analysis.
*  I'll take the sentence, a short sentence.
*  Can eagles that fly swim?
*  Okay, we all understand it.
*  We know that the word can is associated with swim, not fly.
*  We're asking, can they swim, not can they fly?
*  Similarly, we can say things like, are eagles that fly swimming?
*  But we can't say, are eagles that flying swim?
*  Actually, if you think about it, that's a fine thought.
*  It says, are the eagles that are flying swimming, too?
*  So are eagles that flying swim?
*  But you just can't say it that way. That thought can't be expressed in that form.
*  Well, you know, if you think about it, it was taken for granted for forever that that was just sort of intuitively obvious.
*  But if you think about it, it's not at all obvious.
*  Aristotle defined language as sound with meaning.
*  Well, what the pursuit of this inquiry tends to show is that that's not correct, that actually language is meaning with sound.
*  And it need not be sound. It can be sign or some other mode of externalization.
*  That's a big difference.
*  It means that the core character of language is the set of principles that yield structured expressions and assign them a meaning.
*  And that part of language is probably, we can't show it yet, but it looks like it's uniform among humans.
*  It doesn't seem to vary much. And if we knew enough, maybe at all.
*  It's just a core property of humans that we have this set of principles that yields an unbounded array of structural expressions that have a semantic interpretation that means something.
*  And when you look into it, it's pretty strange what it means.
*  But that just seems to be shared among humans altogether.
*  There's no known difference among the remote tribes and Papua.
*  They haven't had other human contact for tens of thousands of years and children who grow up here.
*  And if you interchange them at infancy, they'll grow into their own society without any problem.
*  So that seems to be a core property of human nature.
*  The externalization, what we call the sound part, is marginal.
*  And it also follows from that that communication is marginal.
*  It's kind of like a dogma among even scientists who write about these topics that language is basically a means of communication and evolved as a means of communication.
*  You look at current publications on evolution of language.
*  Which I just take for granted. It apparently is all false.
*  It turns out that from the closer analysis of language that it's actually a tool for thought.
*  It's a means of expressing thought.
*  And on the side, you can use it for communication as you can use anything else for communication.
*  That gives it actually if you just introspect for a minute, that shouldn't be surprising.
*  Just ask yourself, what is most of your own use of language?
*  Well, if you introspect, it turns out that probably 99% of it is talking to yourself.
*  Talking to yourself is not communicating.
*  It takes a tremendous act of will not to talk to yourself.
*  Try it. It's very hard.
*  You're walking down the street, you're talking to yourself in fragments of sentences.
*  It goes on all night, unfortunately.
*  And sometimes it's used for communication, but even the external part is not much.
*  Well, that's a radically different conception of fundamental human nature.
*  And it does lead to in other directions, like at least exploring these thoughts about creative work, about moral judgment and so on.
*  I don't want to exaggerate. This is by no means universally accepted even among scientists.
*  But I think that's the direction in which work has been moving.
*  And I think it is a way of finding out basic things about what kind of creatures we are.
