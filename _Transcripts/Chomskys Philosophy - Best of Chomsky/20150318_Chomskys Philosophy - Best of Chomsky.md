# Noam Chomsky - Human Nature I
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [March 18, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHahMKVj09M)
*  What do you think behaviorally speaking humans primarily are that is do you think we have a sort of Hobbesian human nature or a
*  plastic human nature or something else because this seems to
*  when you hear either conservatives or liberals or people on the far right or far left discuss what kind of policies and what kind of
*  Economics and what we should have you know how we should deal with the rest of the world
*  It usually always often comes back Lisa to justify their opinions always comes back to well
*  This is what humans are and this is therefore more natural for us to do a
*  You know have a capitalist society or be have a social society
*  What do you think is the basic human nature that or do you think that we have a basic human nature?
*  I believe that we are part of the natural world okay?
*  Therefore we have a nature. It's
*  our genetic endowment
*  determines
*  Substantially what our nature is in fact if you look at the growth of any organism us
*  Bees you know yeast whatever you like there are actually three factors that enter into its growth and development
*  One is its genetic constitution another is environmental effects and a third is just the way laws of nature work
*  Which is it turns out as a major effect?
*  and the
*  inquiry into biological organisms takes all of those into account or should as for our
*  Human nature the genetic endowment that we essentially share
*  Very little is known about it
*  I mean it's just a really hard question and as I mentioned in our earlier discussion a lot of the ways of studying it
*  Are excluded simply because we don't allow invasive experimentation
*  The and it you know it's hard enough to learn about insect nature
*  Where we allow ourselves anything and they're much simpler organisms, so what do we know about human nature?
*  Well most of our knowledge comes from history experience
*  Literary exploration and so on that's what our knowledge comes from what does it tell us it tells us that of course?
*  Humans are partially plastic like I don't speak Swahili for example, so we're partially plastic on the other hand
*  There's there has to be an enormous uniformity
*  at a level right below the surface and what we see on the surface is a wide range of possibilities I mean we see people who
*  Are acting in a beastly fashion we see others who are?
*  Kind of sacrificing their lives to save dolphins one of the the sciences and I'm not sure it would be
*  Categorized the hard science or soft science or it's a it's an emerging science evolutionary psychology people like
*  EO Wilson and Steven Pinker have come around and and said they understand what human nature isn't and it's based on this new science
*  Are you saying then that they're either still just guessing or do they have some?
*  Some scientific backing that from what you have if you have read any of their work. Yes, I know there were
*  a lot of them
*  What's now called evolutionary psychology was in fact initiated about a century ago over a century ago by?
*  Peter Kopatian the Anarchist thinker and naturalist who wrote a book called the mutual aid factor in evolution
*  And in it he investigated he was basically trying to counter social Darwinist
*  he was Darwin Darwinist himself, and he argued by looking at a lot of
*  Naturalistic phenomena other animals human history and so on he argued that if you look at it you discover that
*  Mutual aid had a provided a selectional advantage and therefore
*  organisms were had evolved for selection
*  including humans to
*  be
*  Deeply committed to one or another form of mutual aid. Well, you know, that's not what elite opinion wants to hear
*  They want to hear some other story
*  So therefore Kopatian's form of evolutionary psychology essentially disappeared
*  I've been revived to some extent the actual modern the modern state of evolutionary
*  Psychology as I mean, it's not that there's no science there at all
*  There's some you know, like say kin selection is real reciprocal altruism is real a couple other things are real
*  But very little is known. It's thin, you know, this is not
*  Physics and certain it's not molecular biology. It's not chemistry. It's
*  Largely guess is not it's a worthwhile topic to pursue
*  You know, it's my topic to pursue in fact, that's where my own professional work is in particular areas
*  But we should the scientists particularly should be very cautious about
*  inducing the
*  Deluding the public to think that they know more than they do
*  Science is held in enormous respect for good reasons and therefore scientists have a responsibility to make very clear
*  Here's what we know and here's what we don't know
*  And what we know in these areas happens to be extremely thin not because they're not good scientists, but because the questions are too hard
