# Noam Chomsky on Democracy
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [September 28, 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh_Zk6Da9fU)
*  The political system increasingly functions without public input.
*  It means to an increasing extent not only do people not ratify decisions presented to
*  them, but they don't even take the trouble of ratifying them.
*  They assume that the decisions are going on independently of what they may do in the polling
*  booth.
*  Notice that even ratification of decisions made elsewhere is a very weak form of democracy.
*  Ratification would be what?
*  Well, ratification would mean a system in which there are two positions presented to
*  me, the voter.
*  I go into the polling booth and I push one or another button depending on which of those
*  positions I want.
*  That's a very limited form of democracy.
*  A real, really meaningful democracy would mean that I play a role in forming those decisions
*  and creating those positions, that those positions reflect my active, creative participation
*  at it, not just me, but of course everyone.
*  That would be real democracy.
*  That's not very far from that.
*  In a capitalist democracy you have the problem, and it is always perceived as a problem, that
*  the general population has a method of participating in decision making.
*  They can participate in politics.
*  The state is not capable of stopping them.
*  You can't shut them up, you can't put them in jail, you can't keep them away from the
*  polls and so on.
*  And it's striking that that has always been perceived as a problem to be overcome.
*  It's what's called the crisis of democracy.
*  Too many people organizing themselves to enter the public arena.
*  That's a crisis.
*  So therefore we have to have what Walter Lippmann, back in 1920 or so, called manufacture of
*  consent.
*  We have to ensure that actual decision making, actual power is in the hands of what he called
*  a specialized class.
*  Us smart guys, you know, who are going to make the right decisions.
*  And we've got to keep the general population marginalized because they're always going
*  to make mistakes.
*  Marginalizing, meaning?
*  Reduce them to apathy and obedience.
*  Allow them to participate in the political system, but as consumers, not as true participants.
*  That is, allow them a method for ratifying decisions that are made by others, but eliminate
*  the methods by which they might first inform themselves, second organize, and third act
*  in such a way as to really control decision making.
*  That is, the idea is our leaders control us, not we control them.
*  The doctrines of the Enlightenment held that individuals should be free from the coercion
*  of concentrated power.
*  Another kind of concentrated power that they were thinking about was the church and the
*  state and the feudal system and so on.
*  And that you could sort of imagine a population of relatively equal people, at least equal
*  white male property owners who would be not controlled by those private powers.
*  But in the subsequent period, a new form of power developed, namely corporations, with
*  highly concentrated power over decision making in economic life.
*  That is, control over what's produced, what's distributed, what's invested, and so on and
*  so forth is very narrowly concentrated.
*  So this is why the Vice President of the Lords Corporation would say the public mind is the
*  chief team.
*  The public mind might have funny ideas about democracy, which say that we should not be
*  forced simply to rent ourselves to the people who own the country and own its institutions.
*  Rather, we should play a role in determining what those institutions do.
*  That's democracy.
*  If we were to move towards democracy, and I think democracy even in the 18th century
*  since, we would say that there should be no maldistribution of power in determining what's
*  produced, what's distributed, what's invested, and so on.
*  That's a problem for the entire community.
*  In fact, in my own personal view, unless we move in that direction, human society probably
*  isn't going to survive.
*  Why?
*  Well, we now face the most awesome problems of human history, problems such as the likelihood
*  of nuclear conflict, either among the superpowers or through proliferation, the destruction
*  of a fragile environment, which finally we're beginning to recognize, though it was obvious
*  decades ago that we're heading for disaster.
*  Other problems of this nature, they're of a level of seriousness that they never were
*  in the past.
*  But why do you think more participation by the public, more democracy, is the answer?
*  Well, more democracy is a value in itself, because democracy is a value.
*  It doesn't have to be defended anywhere, and freedom has to be defended.
*  It's an essential feature of human nature, that people should be free, they should be
*  able to participate, they should be uncoerced, and so on.
*  These are values in themselves.
*  Why do you think, if we go that route, it will...
*  Because I think that that's the only hope that I can see, that other values will come
*  to the fore.
*  I mean, if the society is based on control by private wealth, it will reflect the values
*  that in fact does reflect the value that the highest, the only real human property is greed,
*  and the desire to maximize personal gain at the expense of others.
*  Now, any society, maybe a small society based on that principle is ugly, but it can survive.
*  A global society based on that principle is headed for massive destruction, and that's
*  what we are.
*  We have to have a mode of social organization that reflects other values that I think are
*  inherent in human nature that people recognize.
*  And that would be...
*  I want to see exactly what you mean.
*  Well, I mean, what are human beings?
*  I mean, in your family, for example, it's not the case that in the family every person
*  tries to maximize personal gain at the expense of others, or if they do, it's kind of pathological.
*  It's not the case that if you and I are, say, walking down the street, and we see a child
*  eating a piece of candy, and we see that nobody's around, and we happen to be hungry, we don't
*  steal it.
*  If we did that, we would be pathological.
*  I mean, the idea of care for others and concern for other people's needs and concern for a
*  fragile environment that must sustain future generations, all of these things are part
*  of human nature.
*  These are elements of human nature that are suppressed in a social and cultural system
*  which is designed to maximize personal gain.
*  And I think we must try to overcome that suppression, and that's in fact what democracy could bring
*  about.
*  It could lead to the expression of other human needs and values which tend to be suppressed
*  under the institutional structure of a system of private power and private profit.
*  If a real democracy is going to thrive, if the real values that are deeply embedded in
*  human nature are going to be able to flourish, and I think that's necessary to save us if
*  nothing else, it's an absolute necessity that groups form in which people can join together,
*  can share their concerns, can articulate their ideas, can gain a response, can discover what
*  they think, can discover what they believe, what their values are.
*  This can't be imposed on you from above.
*  You have to discover it by experiment, by effort, by trial, by application and so on,
*  and this has to be done with others.
*  Furthermore, surely central to human nature is a need to be engaged with others in cooperative
*  efforts of solidarity and concern.
*  That can only happen almost by definition through group structures.
*  And unless such a thing...
*  Political organizations.
*  Political and others.
*  Civic organizations.
*  All sorts.
*  Yeah, I mean, there are all kinds of ways in which people can associate with one another.
*  And I think what I would like to see is a move towards a society which is really based
*  on proliferating voluntary organization with eliminating as much as possible structures
*  of hierarchy and domination and the basis for them in ownership and control, and becoming
*  the means by which we govern ourselves, by which we control our lives.
