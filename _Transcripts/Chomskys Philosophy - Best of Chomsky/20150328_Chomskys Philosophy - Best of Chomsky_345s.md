# Noam Chomsky - The Consequences of Your Actions
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [March 28, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8crzmi6LpUU)
*  What I focus on, frankly, is based on a very elementary moral principle.
*  I realize it's almost universally rejected, but I'd still like to reiterate it.
*  Our prime concern should be our own responsibilities.
*  Our prime concern for anybody should be the predictable consequences of your own actions.
*  I mean, it's very convenient to be self-righteous and to talk about somebody else's crimes.
*  So, if you were a Russian commissar in the 1970s, it would be very convenient to concentrate on U.S. crimes.
*  But the important thing to do in Russia was not that.
*  I don't care whether Sakharov said anything about U.S. crimes.
*  What you care is what they're saying about their own society and something they can do about it.
*  And the same elementary moral principle applies to us.
*  The focus of our attention should be on what we can do, what we are doing,
*  what are the options for us to try to terminate major crimes in which we're involved,
*  and there are plenty of them, and to mitigate harm and atrocities elsewhere.
*  And there's a lot that we can do.
*  You say that what the media do is to ignore certain kinds of atrocities that are committed by us and our friends,
*  and to play up enormously atrocities that are committed by them and our enemies.
*  And you posit that there's a test of integrity and moral honesty,
*  which is to have a kind of equality of treatment of corpses.
*  Equality of principles.
*  I mean, that every dead person should be in principle equal to every other dead person.
*  That's not what I say at all.
*  Well, I'm glad that's not what you say, because that's not what you do.
*  Of course it's not what I do.
*  Nor would I say it.
*  In fact, I say the opposite.
*  What I say is that we should be responsible for our own actions primarily.
*  Because your method is not only to ignore the corpses created by them,
*  but also to ignore the corpses that are created by neither side,
*  but which are irrelevant to your ideological agenda.
*  That's totally untrue.
*  Well, let me give you an example.
*  That one of your own causes that you take very seriously is the cause of the Palestinians.
*  And a Palestinian corpse weighs very heavily on your conscience.
*  And yet a Kurdish corpse does not.
*  That's not true at all.
*  I've been involved in Kurdish support groups for years.
*  That's absolutely true.
*  That's absolutely false.
*  I mean, just ask the Kurdish, ask the people who are involved in...
*  I mean, you know, they come to me, I sign their petitions, and so on and so forth.
*  And if you look at the things we've written, I mean, take a look.
*  I mean, I'm not Amnesty International.
*  I can't do everything.
*  I'm a single person.
*  But if you read, say, take a look, say, at the book that Edward Herman and I wrote on this topic.
*  In it, we discuss three kinds of atrocities.
*  What we call benign blood baths, which nobody cares about.
*  Constructive blood baths, which are the ones we like.
*  And nefarious blood baths, which are the ones that the bad guys do.
*  The principle that I think we ought to follow is not the one that you stated.
*  You know, it's a very simple ethical point.
*  You're responsible for the predictable consequences of your actions.
*  You're not responsible for the predictable consequences of somebody else's actions.
*  The most important thing for me and for you is to think about the consequences of your actions.
*  What can you affect?
*  These are the things to keep in mind.
*  These are not just academic exercises.
*  We're not analyzing the media on Mars or in the 18th century or something like that.
*  We're dealing with real human beings who are suffering and dying and being tortured and
*  starving because of policies that we are involved in.
*  We as citizens of democratic societies are directly involved in and are responsible for.
*  And what the media are doing is ensuring that we do not act on our responsibilities
*  and that the interests of power are served, not the needs of the suffering people and not even
*  the needs of the American people who would be horrified if they realize the blood that's
*  dripping from their hands because of the way they're allowing themselves to be
*  diluted and manipulated by the system.
*  What about the third world?
*  Well, despite everything, and it's pretty ugly and awful,
*  these struggles are not over.
*  The struggle for freedom and independence never is completely over.
*  Their courage, in fact, is really remarkable and amazing.
*  I've personally had the privilege, and it is a privilege, of witnessing it a few times in
*  villages in Southeast Asia and Central America and recently in the occupied West Bank.
*  And it is astonishing to see.
*  And it's always amazing, at least to me it's amazing, I can't understand it.
*  It's also very moving and very inspiring.
*  In fact, it's kind of awe-inspiring.
*  Now, they rely very crucially on a very slim margin for survival that's provided by
*  dissidence and turbulence within the imperial societies.
*  And how large that margin is, is for us to determine.
