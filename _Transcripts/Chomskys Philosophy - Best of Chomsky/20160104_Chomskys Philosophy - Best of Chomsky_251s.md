# Noam Chomsky - Apathy, Equanimity, and the Terror of Our Age
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [January 04, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eJUx33Gy54)
*  You say the war is simply an obscenity, a depraved act by weak and miserable men.
*  Including all of us, including myself, including every... that's the next sentence, same sentence.
*  Oh, sure, sure, sure, because you count everybody in the company of the guilty.
*  I think that's true in this case.
*  See, one of the points I'm trying...
*  This is a sense of theological observation, isn't it?
*  No, I don't think so.
*  Because as somebody points out, if everybody's guilty of everything, then nobody's guilty of anything.
*  No, I don't... well, no, I don't believe that.
*  See, I think that... I think the point that I'm trying to make, and I think ought to be made,
*  is that the real... at least to me, I say this elsewhere in the book,
*  what seems to me a very, in a sense, terrifying aspect of our society and other societies,
*  is the equanimity and the detachment with which sane, reasonable, sensible people
*  can observe such events.
*  I think that's more terrifying than the occasional Hitler or LeMay or other that crops up.
*  These people would not be able to operate were it not for this apathy and equanimity.
*  And therefore, I think that it's, in some sense, the sane and reasonable and tolerant people
*  who share a very serious burden of guilt that they very easily throw on the
*  shoulders of others who seem more extreme and more violent.
*  Now, let me ask you this.
*  If, in fact, your concern is to communicate your moral concern,
*  to what extent have you spent time thinking about your techniques?
*  Now, I say this seriously because it is probably true that under certain circumstances,
*  the communication of one's own indignation and fury and restraint is best communicated
*  emotionally, i.e. to one's own satisfaction by screaming and yelling.
*  But if it becomes observable that this doesn't bring people around,
*  then you've got to consider the problem of communication.
*  It becomes a moral problem, just as you would consent to argue Auschwitz or Buchenwald
*  with somebody if there was a chance of dissipating something of the sort.
*  Now, if you have given that problem any thought,
*  how come that you end up saying, as you do in your book,
*  that Senator Mike Mansfield is, quote,
*  the kind of man who is the terror of our age?
*  Well, let me put that in its context as well.
*  What I say is, I believe that, and what I say is that
*  Senator Mansfield is an American intellectual in the best sense,
*  a sane, reasonable, scholarly man, the kind of man who is the terror of our age.
*  And that's essentially what I was saying before.
*  I think that the terror of our age is the same responsible, serious, quiet man
*  who watches these things unfold and doesn't react to them.
*  I include myself in that, as I tried to make clear in the earlier statements.
*  Well, if, put it this way, your counsel is surely a counsel of despair
*  if, on the one hand, you are costus with your own relative moral superiority
*  and yet end up despising yourself, appealing to scrupulosity for your own shortcomings.
*  I mean, this makes things pretty...
*  Not really. For one thing, I don't feel any relative moral superiority,
*  and I tried, maybe failed, but I tried very hard to express that in the book.
*  But I said somewhere in the beginning that if there is any tone of self-righteousness
*  or anything like that, it's unintended and certainly undeserved.
*  And I mean that very much.
*  See, I mean, after all, given the feelings that I have,
*  which I've just expressed, you know, and which you perceive,
*  I should be doing really strong things, which I don't think I am doing.
*  So there's no sense of moral superiority.
*  And I'm not interested in simply, you know, throwing blame around or giving people marks.
*  I think that the beginning of wisdom in this case is to recognize something about
*  what we stand for in the world, what we're doing in the world.
*  And I think when we do recognize that, we will feel an enormous sense of guilt.
*  And I say somewhere in there that one should be very careful
*  not to let confessions of guilt overcome the possibility of action.
*  I say that confessions of guilt can be very good therapy, as they can, as is well known.
*  They're also a very good preventative to action.
*  And I think one should be very wary of that.
