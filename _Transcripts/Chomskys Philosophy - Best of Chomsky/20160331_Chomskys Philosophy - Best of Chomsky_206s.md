# Noam Chomsky - Lenin, the USSR, and the Predictions of Bakunin
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [March 31, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfdnbMd9BiE)
*  The Leninist system was one of the greatest blows that socialism suffered in the 20th century,
*  maybe second only to fascism.
*  I mean, as Lenin took power among its first acts, along with Trotsky,
*  to destroy the socialist institutions that had arisen in the pre-Polish Soviet period.
*  The Soviet factory councils, constituent assembly, which was dominated by left social revolutionaries,
*  largely peasant-based.
*  Of course, they meant the war against the anarchists, a major war to try to wipe out the Makhnoz army and so on.
*  And there was a sort of a logic behind it.
*  They were orthodox Marxists, unlike Marx, incidentally.
*  They believed in a version of Marxism that said that revolution can't come in a backward peasant society,
*  which is what Russia was.
*  It was what we would now call a third world country, an undeveloped peasant society,
*  with some development owned by the West and so on.
*  I mean, a highly educated and productive intellectual class, but that's also true of third world societies.
*  So they thought this couldn't happen.
*  So therefore, we have to drive this backward population through industrialization by force.
*  And then later on, by the iron laws of history and so on and so forth, will come the socialism.
*  Of course, it's all nonsense.
*  So they essentially laid the basis for a totalitarian system with an ideological doctrine behind it.
*  When the Soviet Union collapsed, I actually wrote an article saying this is a victory for socialism,
*  a small victory for socialism.
*  It just couldn't get published.
*  Nobody knew what I was talking about.
*  The world's two major propaganda systems, the West and the Soviet Union,
*  they both decided, determined to use the word socialism to refer to the totalitarian system of the Soviet Union.
*  I mean, the West did it to discredit socialism.
*  The Bolsheviks did it to try to gain the credit associated with genuine socialism.
*  Well, when the world's two propaganda systems agree, it's going to be very hard for people to extricate themselves from it.
*  So now, socialism has, the term has been degraded to mean the form of totalitarianism instituted by Lenin and carried through by Stalin.
*  And I was going back to Spain.
*  It was entirely natural that they should be in the lead in destroying the popular revolution.
*  Bakunin, much earlier, had predicted all of this.
*  He said that in the future, there will be two forms.
*  One form will be they'll take over the state and they'll create a red bureaucracy,
*  which will be the most vile and brutal regime the world's ever seen.
*  And there are others who will understand that they can't take over the state.
*  So they have to serve concentrated private power and state power.
*  And there will be the technical intelligentsia who implement the policies of the masters in what we now call liberal democracies,
*  which is a very good prediction.
*  It's one of the few predictions in the social sciences that actually came true,
*  which is one of the reasons why nobody ever studies it.
*  It's much too dangerous and too insightful.
