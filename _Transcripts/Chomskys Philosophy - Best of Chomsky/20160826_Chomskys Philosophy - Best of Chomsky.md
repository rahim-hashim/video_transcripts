# Noam Chomsky - Bailouts
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [August 26, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiOwAyN27v0)
*  Suppose I, uh, I suppose I lend you a hundred dollars and a couple of years later you pay me back a hundred dollars.
*  Oh yeah.
*  Who lost?
*  Yeah.
*  Okay. But furthermore, the bailouts are a very small part of the public subsidy.
*  When the business press uses IMF figures to estimate 83 billion dollars a year of subsidy, they're not talking about the bailouts.
*  They're talking about other things that some of which I mentioned like cheap credit, access to cheap credit, higher credit ratings, inflated credit ratings, which give you all kind of options.
*  Because the credit agencies understand that there's a government insurance policy.
*  These guys are going to be bailed out if they get into trouble so we can give them higher credit ratings.
*  It also means many other things.
*  If you're say, Goldman Sachs, you can make a risky transaction.
*  Risky transactions tend to make high profits, but they also carry the possibility of failure.
*  But you don't have to worry about it, right?
*  Because you guys are going to pay them if they get into trouble.
*  That's a government insurance policy.
*  If you had an insurance policy like that, you could do all sorts of things.
*  But you do give the banks that insurance policy.
*  As I said, the IMF figures lead to an estimate of 83 billion dollars a year.
*  You could argue the details, but something on that order.
*  And they say that's essentially all the profits of the big banks.
*  That has enormous consequences.
*  One of the consequences is what's called the systemic risk.
*  There's a risk.
*  If say, Goldman Sachs makes a risky transaction and it happens to fail, it might bring down the whole system.
*  We saw that a couple of years ago when Lehman went.
*  It looked like the whole thing was going to collapse.
*  Well, there's a protection against systemic risk.
*  Namely, you pay for it and guarantee it's not going to happen.
*  That just increases risky behavior and the likelihood of crashes like what we're now seeing.
*  These are all pretty serious problems.
*  They're not at the level of climate catastrophe and nuclear war.
*  Those are colossal dangers.
*  But these are pretty serious dangers.
*  I mean, the public really suffered from the latest financial collapse.
*  The financial housing bubble collapsed.
*  A lot of people are still suffering from it.
*  Actually, there was congressional legitimate.
*  Speaking of bailouts, bailouts came from congressional legislation.
*  But that congressional legislation had two parts to it.
*  One was bail out the criminals.
*  The other was help the people who were their victims, protect them from foreclosures and so on.
*  Which part of the bargain was kept?
*  Well, it's not a secret.
*  The inspector general of the Justice Department, Neil Barofsky, was screaming about it.
*  He wrote a book about it.
*  But that's really existing capitalist democracy.
*  That's the way it works.
*  That's its logic.
*  So yeah, they sort of paid back kind of the actual bailout.
*  But that's a joke.
*  And in fact, what's happening now is just mind boggling.
*  The biggest, the world's biggest insurance company, AIG, was on the verge of collapse.
*  And the government essentially bought it and bailed it out.
*  Now it's richer than ever.
*  I wasn't just going to knock out AIG.
*  So Goldman Sachs, for example, was heavily involved in risky loans guaranteed by AIG.
*  If AIG went down, Goldman Sachs would go down and so on across the board.
*  But you guys stepped in and saved it all.
*  Right after that, after it was rescued from having virtually brought down the international economy,
*  AIG gave extended, expanded bonuses to its chief executives.
*  That caused a little, little bit of controversy.
*  You know, how come they're, after we, these guys practically destroy the economy and we pay them off,
*  they decide to give themselves bonuses.
*  Larry Summers, former Secretary of the Treasury,
*  Obama's, you know, one of his chief advisors, responded to that saying,
*  well, we just don't have any choice.
*  It's a contractual obligation.
*  And we believe in contractual obligations, so we're just forced to accept it.
*  At the very same time, the state of Illinois was refusing to pay pensions to public service workers
*  because they said they didn't have enough money.
*  Was that a contractual obligation?
*  Not only that, I mean, the workers had already paid for it.
*  When you have a pension, it's because you take lower wages.
*  That's a bargain that's made.
*  But that contractual obligation, which workers already paid for, that one didn't have to be on it.
*  And we're back to the logic of rec again.
*  AIG executives, yeah, of course, they have to get a huge bonus after practically destroying us.
*  But teachers, firemen and so on, they're not going to get a huge bonus.
*  But teachers, firemen and so on, they don't deserve that kind of thing.
*  That's what George Orwell once called unpeople, distinct from people.
*  So they, no contractual obligations there.
*  That's our commitment to capitalist principles.
*  What's happening now is beyond grotesque.
*  The former CEO of AIG, Maurice Greenberger, is now,
*  he's the principal in a court suit, Star International versus US government.
*  It's going to Supreme Court right now.
*  He's complaining that the bonuses weren't, that the payout to AIG wasn't big enough.
*  And he wants to be reimbursed for costs to AIG.
*  That's, you know, if anybody asks you for the definition of chutzpah, you can mention it.
*  That's in the Supreme Court right now.
*  And, you know, given the nature of the court, it's not so easy to figure out how it'll turn out,
*  even though, I mean, this is like beyond insanity,
*  except under the logic of really existing capitalist democracy.
*  That's the story of the bailout.
