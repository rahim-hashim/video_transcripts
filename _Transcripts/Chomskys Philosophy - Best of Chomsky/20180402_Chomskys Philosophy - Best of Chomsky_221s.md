# Noam Chomsky - Neoliberalism II
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [April 02, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9awI2P0Xq8E)
*  I think that what's called neoliberalism is an attack on democracy and is an open attack on
*  democracy. It's not secret. The goal is to minimize the state and if you minimize the
*  state you're maximizing something else. What is the thing that you're maximizing? Well,
*  private tyranny. The state is the arena within which the public has some role, at least in
*  principle in determining policy. In the private sector it has no role. So the more that the public
*  arena is minimized and private power is maximized, the less you have democracy. Now, personally,
*  in my view, the state is an illegitimate institution. It should be dismantled, but not as long as private
*  power is there because that's much worse. That's a system which is unaccountable to the public.
*  And the main thrust of neoliberalism is precisely that. It's to restrict the arena within which the
*  public can make some difference. My suggestion is to extend the public arena and in the classic
*  fashion, namely, as I said before, working people should have control of the places in which they
*  work, not private tyrants. The people of the community should have control of their community
*  and they should interact with one another. That increases the public sphere. If the heavy concentration
*  of private power is eliminated, then I think moves towards dismantling the entire state system are
*  entirely legit and proper. But you face the world that you're in right now. Incidentally, these
*  neoliberal moves are not moves towards establishing a market system. A private corporation is outside
*  the market system. If you look at world trade, you know, about take say the United States,
*  about half of US trade is not trade at all. It's just transactions internal to a corporation run
*  by a very visible hand, which just happened to cross borders. So half of US exports to Mexico
*  don't even enter the Mexican economy. They're just parts are being assembled in the United States,
*  transferred to Mexico to another branch of say the same Ford Motor Company. It's called exports.
*  They come back to the United States called imports. That's not trade. That's mercantilism. And that's
*  huge part of world trade. It's kind of corporate mercantilism in which the market is functioning
*  only at the margins and functioning mostly to control people. The ones who are running the world
*  economy have protected themselves very strongly from market discipline. In fact, if you look at
*  the top, there are some good studies by good economists of transnational corporations. And
*  there's one major study by two British economists of the top 100 transnational corporations. Every
*  one of them has benefited from the interventionist policies of its own of its home government. And
*  20 of the hundred have been saved from complete collapse by state takeover and bailout. Over and
*  above that, the corporation itself is out of the market system. Its internal transactions are
*  central centrally directed. These are command economies. So you have a new neoliberal system
*  is an attack in my view, both on the market and on democracy.
