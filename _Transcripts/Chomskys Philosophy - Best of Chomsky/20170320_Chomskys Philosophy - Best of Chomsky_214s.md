# Noam Chomsky - Classical Liberalism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [March 20, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Eu2Y8G5V0s)
*  Classical liberalism was, say in Wilhelm von Humboldt, parts of Rousseau's second discourse,
*  other enlightenment conceptions, actually goes all the way back to Descartes,
*  it was committed to a conception of human nature as being based on
*  unconstrained creative activity. So for example, say for Humboldt,
*  one of the founders of classical liberalism, also the modern education system, also linguistics,
*  his basic picture was summarized in a phrase in which he said that if a craftsman produces
*  beautiful work on command, we may admire what he does but we'll despise what he is,
*  a tool in the hands of others. If the craftsman creates out of his own interest, initiative,
*  commitment, search, then we admire what he is. And the same with a child, if a child
*  is treated like, say in the schools, like a vessel into which you pour water,
*  maybe the water will come out again in the right form but it's not education. What the teacher
*  ought to be doing is, Humboldt's phrase, laying out a thread along which the student progresses in
*  his or her own way from inner impulses and that relates immediately to social organization,
*  follows right away that any acceptable, decent form of social organization ought to be based on,
*  ought to nurture and encourage free creative activity and that includes self-determination,
*  control of all the decisions that matter in the institution. So it's kind of like a seamless web
*  and out of that comes classical liberalism and as Rudolf Rocker, an anarchist thinker,
*  pointed out I think pretty accurately, classical liberalism founded on the shoals of capitalism.
*  When this is pre-capitalist and when capitalist structures developed, classical liberalism was
*  destroyed. It couldn't, its own conceptions of freedom, independence and creativity were
*  stunted or destroyed by the hierarchical managerial structure that was a core of capitalist
*  institutions. An anarchism then would be the, from this point of view, would be the
*  development of the remnants of classical liberalism and conversion of them into
*  ways of thinking and acting in a capitalist or post-capitalist society.
*  Anarcho-syndicalism specifically was directed towards the organization of industrial societies.
*  So I think there's a continuity that goes through.
