# Noam Chomsky on Taxes
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [October 25, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYuQRjLcGjY)
*  A very good measure of how democratic a society is, is to ask about the attitude towards taxes.
*  I mean, if you had a free functioning democratic society, April 15th,
*  when you pay your taxes, that would be a day of celebration.
*  Here we are getting together to fund the policies that we decided on.
*  That's great. That's what we want to do.
*  Here it's a day of mourning. It's not a government of by and for the people.
*  That itself is a sign of the serious decline of the functioning of the democratic system.
