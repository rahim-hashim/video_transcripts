# Noam Chomsky - Innate Notion of Justice
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [January 30, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCDcxapD9FI)
*  It seems to me that the notion of justice itself works within the class society as a claim
*  on the part of the oppressed class and as a justification on the part of the oppressed class.
*  And in a society without class, I am not sure that we are still using this notion of justice.
*  I totally disagree. I think that there is a sort of an absolute basis,
*  if you press me too hard I'll be in trouble because I can't sketch it out,
*  but some sort of an absolute basis ultimately residing in fundamental human qualities
*  in terms of which a real notion of justice is grounded.
*  And I think that our existing systems of justice, I think it's too hasty to characterize
*  existing systems of justice as merely systems of class oppression.
*  I don't think that they are that. I think that they embody systems of class oppression
*  and they embody elements of other kinds of oppression.
*  But they also embody a kind of a groping towards the true human, humanly valuable concept
*  of justice and decency and love and kindness and sympathy and so on, which I think are real.
