# Noam Chomsky - Freedom of the Will
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [November 14, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQf_XoQO-5M)
*  Okay, your political ideas have a foundation on ethics.
*  Ethics, morality.
*  And then I want to ask you how is morality compatible with limited mind, determined human, as you put it, if I understood you well.
*  Because in limited mind and determined human I don't see a place for the free will, which is the base of morality in the human world.
*  So what do you think about it?
*  About free will?
*  And morality, which is of course the base of politics and social ideas.
*  The human moral principles we can study, like the kind of work that I mentioned, John Michail and others, are carrying out the beginnings of experimental work which sheds light on and may ultimately shed a lot of light on what our innate moral principles are, what Hume was looking for, for example, and Adam Smith and others.
*  That could shed some light on it.
*  So I don't think it's going to tell you much about freedom of the will.
*  Freedom of the will, I think, we're stuck pretty much where Descartes was.
*  We just can't abandon believing it.
*  It's our most immediate phenomenologically obvious impression.
*  But we can't explain it.
*  And as he said, if there's something which we just know to be true and we don't have any explanation for it, well, too bad for our explanatory possibilities.
*  But I don't see any way of getting around that.
*  There's a lot of arguments that we don't have freedom of the will.
*  And those arguments are there's a ton of literature on that.
*  And the literature is kind of interesting, actually, for reasons that William James discussed.
*  He said, if you believe that there's no freedom of the will, why bother presenting an argument?
*  You're just you're forced to do it.
*  The person you're talking to can't be convinced because there's no such thing as reasons.
*  So why not watch a baseball game?
*  That wasn't his example.
*  But, you know, anybody who denies freedom of the will actually believes that it's there.
*  Otherwise, they wouldn't bother presenting reasons.
*  I mean, unless they say, look, I'm just forced to present these.
*  I can't do anything else but these reasons.
*  And it's very, very odd.
*  These discussions, many of them.
*  Actually, you may have seen some experimental work which caused a big flurry a couple of years ago.
*  Some neurophysiologists discovered that if a person is going to carry an act of will to action, let's say, you know, pick this up, say,
*  there's you can find activity in the motor centers of the brain before there's a decision to pick it up.
*  OK.
*  And that was held to show, OK, we've undermined freedom of the will.
*  It doesn't say anything.
*  All it says is what we ought to know anyway.
*  Decisions are mostly made unconsciously.
*  By the time they reach the level of consciousness, they've probably already been made.
*  But that doesn't tell anything about how decisions are made.
*  But you didn't answer me.
*  At least I didn't realize I didn't perceive that I got an answer.
*  Is it compatible?
*  You're teaching about determined, genetic determined humans and ethics, political ethics, morality, and free will.
*  That is what I ask.
*  Is it compatible?
*  It's compatible.
*  It's incompatible and unexplainable.
*  You said it's unexplainable.
*  I don't understand why belief in certain ethical principles should be inconsistent with the belief that we have an ability to make choices.
*  In fact, they seem totally consistent.
*  Maybe it's all wrong, but they're consistent.
*  If somebody's determined, one cannot take a choice.
*  That is that is the seems like that's the base.
*  I didn't I don't understand what the alleged inconsistency is.
*  In fact, it's more like what you thought you said before that moral the commitment to moral principles basically presupposes freedom of the will.
*  But I don't see any inconsistency.
*  She attributed some belief in genetic determinism to you, but you haven't committed to anything.
*  You know, genetic, there's genetic determinism, of course.
*  That's why I'm that's why we're all humans and not insects.
*  Because that's our genetic endowment.
*  That's genetic determinism.
*  That's just what follows from it.
*  You know, you have to look and see.
*  We don't know.
*  My question relates to the previous question, actually.
*  Free will.
*  You know, as a philosopher, I'd like to pull you as a philosopher.
*  I'd like to ask you this question.
*  You know, studies have shown that decisions made in the brain actually appear some moments before an individual.
*  Well, how can you then say that there is such a thing as free will?
*  I mean, thus, wiring determinism, you know, it proves that free will basically doesn't exist.
*  Those are the experiments I was just referring to.
*  There are some experiments which show that in order to make a decision, you have to have a certain level of freedom of the will.
*  So that in a willed action, simple willed motor action, you know, picking something up,
*  there is activity in the relevant parts of the motor cortex before the decision to pick it up is conscious.
*  OK, that tells us absolutely nothing about freedom of the will, except that its choices are probably unconscious.
*  But I think we know that without the experiments.
*  What?
*  Complicated.
*  Complicated, oh yeah.
*  Anything in this area is very complicated.
*  When we understand nothing, everything's complicated.
*  That's another truism.
*  The primary attribute of supernatural thinking is that there are magical entities or forces which control the fate of humanity.
*  On the contrary, most naturalists argue that humans are actually just one sort of animal, very much a part of the natural world.
*  This then means that our behaviors are determined by some combination of our genetic makeup and the environment from birth to death,
*  and how that environment acts on those genes.
*  Do you think such a naturalism leaves open the possibility of free will, which seems to contradict our notion of cause and effect universe?
*  No, it doesn't contradict anything.
*  It just says that we don't know whether the phenomenon that we all experience,
*  it's our most immediate experience, the phenomenon of freedom of will is a real aspect of the universe that we simply don't comprehend yet or maybe ever,
*  or whether it's an illusion that can be explained in some other fashion.
*  That question just remains open.
*  There's plenty of things we don't understand.
*  For example, we don't really have an intuitive grasp of something which now naturalists take for granted,
*  namely that if I move my hand, I'm moving the moon.
*  That there can be interaction at a distance.
*  When Newton proposed that, he regarded it as a total absurdity.
*  That's why he, which as he said, no person of sound scientific understanding can imagine to be true for a moment.
*  In fact, he spent the rest of his life trying to find some way to get around it,
*  as did leading scientists not only in his day but for centuries afterwards.
*  It finally became scientific common sense.
*  Well, there are things about the world we just can't comprehend, and we don't know how far.
*  If we are just part of the animal world, as I believe and I think you believe,
*  then our cognitive capacities are going to be like all our other capacities.
*  They'll have a certain scope and they'll have certain limits.
*  That's the nature of a biological organism.
*  You're suggesting that until we know more about the workings of the human mind
*  or that neuroscience is starting to show us,
*  we can't definitively come down one way or another on the free will question.
*  It's more of a matter of intuition and still in the realm of philosophy?
*  Bertrand Russell pointed out back in the 1920s and I think correctly
*  that there are several grades of confidence that we have or we should have in our belief system.
*  The highest confidence is in our immediate experience.
*  The second level of confidence, he said, is in the reports of immediate experience by others who are like us.
*  And the third level, lowest level of confidence,
*  would be in the scientific constructions that we develop to try to make some sense out of our experience.
*  Well, you know, our most immediate experience,
*  I can't think of anything more immediate and less questionable,
*  is that I could decide right now to say hang up the phone or start talking about the Boston Red Sox or a thousand other things,
*  but I'm not going to do it because it wouldn't be appropriate.
*  Our most immediate experience is that we act in ways which are somehow appropriate situations,
*  which is quite different than saying they're caused by them.
*  Maybe there is some way of accounting for our choices in terms of the circumstances in which we're placed and something internal to us.
*  But, you know, that's a thesis.
*  It's certainly counterintuitive.
*  And I think philosophers who discuss what they call themselves determinists,
*  like your friend of mine, Ted Hondrick, would argue that it is counterintuitive.
*  And it may be easier to dismiss what they call countercausal free will than to affirm pure determinism.
*  But it is a very complex question.
*  I don't even believe that it's a complex question.
*  I think it's something that we simply do not know.
*  There are a lot of things we don't know.
*  One of them is whether the immediate experience of freedom of will is an illusion
*  or whether it is in fact an aspect of the universe that we have not yet come to comprehend
*  and that our cognitive capacities may not allow us to comprehend,
*  just as our cognitive capacities, if we are serious about it, are like Newton's.
*  They do not allow us to comprehend the fact that action without contact is possible.
*  We accept it and we understand theories about it.
*  But there's a big difference between intelligibility of theories and intelligibility of the world.
*  In fact, what happened in the Newtonian revolution took a long time for it to sink in,
*  was that the aspirations of science were lowered.
*  In the early modern scientific revolution, say Galileo up through Newton and beyond,
*  the assumption was, guiding idea was, that the world is like, is a kind of a complicated machine,
*  sort of like a clock, you know, fancy clocks that artisans built, just a lot more complicated.
*  And we can understand it. And our goal is to try to gain the understanding of how this machine works.
*  Well, when Newton came along, he was accused of reviving occult forces,
*  things that a machine can't have, like action at a distance.
*  And he more or less accepted that. And, you know, he's not a fool, Newton,
*  nor were the other great scientists of the day.
*  And in fact, if you look at what really happened over time, the aspirations were lowered.
*  The goals of science were lowered from intelligibility of the world,
*  which we kind of give up, to intelligibility of theoretical explanations of the world,
*  which we hold and try to pursue.
*  Well, the reason why I'm asking this question at all, because I think it might be important
*  due to the understanding it might offer us and how we treat one another,
*  especially with regard to, say, the criminal justice system.
*  For instance, if we understand that we're not ultimately responsible for our actions, as determinists say,
*  we might want to alter our rather punitive methodology regarding punishment and reward,
*  and we focus our efforts on creating a healthier environment from the get-go.
*  I think, I mean, I agree with your goal, we should know what you're describing,
*  but I think that's totally independent of what speculations we have about the nature of freedom of the will.
*  We do it anyway.
*  I mean, in our ordinary lives and in human affairs, we simply take for granted that people have freedom of will,
*  just as we see in ourselves, and that they therefore have moral responsibilities.
*  How we proceed to deal with the questions that arise,
*  that's a matter of the level of humanity and of civilization that we've achieved.
*  There's big debates about freedom of will.
*  It's kind of striking that everyone who participates in these debates,
*  including the people who write learned tomes showing there's no freedom of will,
*  believe in freedom of will.
*  Otherwise, they wouldn't write the learned tomes.
*  I mean, if we're all just thermostats of some complicated kind,
*  then what you do is determined and how people react is determined, so what's the point of the effort?
*  So everyone kind of intuitively believes it.
*  I mean, we all believe that I can either pick this up or throw it across the room or not do anything with it.
*  But what is it?
*  Well, it lies beyond...
*  I think you can speculate about what the core of the problem is.
*  If you take a look at human science, there are two concepts that are pretty well understood.
*  One of them is determinacy.
*  Something determines something else.
*  The other one is randomness.
*  Things happen without anything determining them.
*  And that's about it, I think.
*  Those are the basic concepts that we comprehend.
*  And freedom of will just doesn't fit in that set of concepts.
*  Well, it could be that this is just another mystery for humans.
*  We don't have the right concept.
*  Some Martian might be looking at us and thinking how stupid we are.
*  Why do we keep the determinacy and randomness when there's obviously that thing out there that I can't point to because I'm a human?
*  Could be.
*  And many other things that seem imponderable might turn out to be like this.
*  I mean, once we recognize that we're not angels, we are just biological organisms.
*  And as such, we must have limits.
*  That's just point of logic.
*  You could not have any capacities at all if you didn't have limits because the capacities determine the limits.
*  And then the question comes, well, what's beyond the limits?
*  The people who don't believe we have free will often make this point.
*  Let's say we turned back time to a specific decision that you made.
*  You couldn't have done otherwise.
*  The universe, your body, your brain, the particles in your brain were in such a condition that your decision was going to happen.
*  At that very moment, you made the decision.
*  All the neurons were in such a way that it had to happen.
*  And this all applies to the time leading up to the decision as well.
*  In other words, you don't have free will.
*  Yourself, the control you feel that you have is an illusion made up by neurons, synapses, et cetera, that are in such a way that everything that happens in your brain is forced.
*  What is wrong with this argument?
*  It begs the question.
*  It assumes that all that exists is determinacy and randomness.
*  But that is exactly what is in question.
*  It also adds the really outlandish assumption that we know that neurons are the right place to look.
*  That's seriously questioned, even within current brain science.
*  Okay, but whatever it is that's causing us to make decisions, wasn't it in such a way that the decision was forced?
*  So forget neurons and synapses.
*  Take the building blocks of the universe, then, strings or whatever they are.
*  Aren't they in such a condition that you couldn't have acted in a different way?
*  Everything is physical, right?
*  So doesn't the argument still stand?
*  The argument stands if we beg the only serious question and assume that the actual elements of the universe are restricted to determinacy and randomness.
*  If so, then there is no free will, contrary to what everyone believes, including those who write denying that there is free will, a pointless exercise in interaction between two thermostats, where both action and response are predetermined, or random.
