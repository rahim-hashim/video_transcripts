# Noam Chomsky - Our Capacity to Destroy Ourselves
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 29, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN38pFqkivE)
*  You've said either the general population will take control of our destiny or there
*  will be no destiny for anyone to control.
*  Why is that so?
*  I think we are in a situation where the human species has developed the capacity to destroy
*  itself and everything else.
*  Now that's been true since the Second World War.
*  And we are edging very close to the possibility of that happening.
*  It's come very close in the past.
*  I mean, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, which Arthur Schlesinger described as the most dangerous
*  moment in human history, we just learned last October how dangerous it was.
*  Last October it was revealed at the retrospective conference of participants in Havana, American,
*  Russian and Cuban, that the world was literally one word away from the terminal nuclear war.
*  Russian submarine commanders, it turns out, had nuclear-tipped missiles.
*  And they were under attack by American destroyers at the edge of Kennedy's quarantine zone.
*  They assumed the nuclear war was going on.
*  Two of the commanders ordered the missiles sent.
*  That would have led to a devastating response, taking out Moscow.
*  Then comes New York and then we're over.
*  One commander countermanded it.
*  That was a consequence of an international terrorist war aimed at regime change.
*  Those notions are right in the headlines.
*  And we're coming very close to that now.
*  I mean, the preventive war doctrine last September is just instructing people in the world that
*  you better develop weapons of mass destruction or a means of terrorism in order to deter
*  the United States.
*  Or secondly, or take another domain.
*  Nobody really understands in any detail what's going on with the climate.
*  It's a complicated issue.
*  There's a near consensus among scientists that we're playing with fire.
*  Could be.
*  It's kind of like Afghanistan.
*  You're risking the possibility of very severe destruction if anything goes wrong.
*  These are sort of nonlinear processes.
*  I mean, a slight change could have a big effect.
*  You don't know what's going to happen.
*  Maybe in Ice Age in Europe or some other thing.
*  Well, you know, we're very near the edge in nuclear weapons development, in other weapons
*  of mass destruction, in policies that are creating international chaos, in destroying,
*  possibly destroying an environment in which decent survival is possible.
*  None of this is predictable.
*  It's just all too close for comfort.
*  And things are tending in that direction.
*  I mean, it's not particularly new.
*  I mean, take, say, the history of Europe.
*  For hundreds of years, Europe was the most savage place in the world.
*  The main activity of Europeans was slaughtering each other, meanwhile, on the side, conquering
*  most of the world.
*  In 1945, they called it off.
*  Why?
*  Well, very straightforward reason.
*  It was understood by French and Germans and British that the next time they play the centuries-old
*  game of slaughtering each other, it's going to be the end of the world because they had
*  developed means of destruction so enormous that you just can't do it anymore.
*  So now Europe is a peaceful region.
*  But unless that extends to the world, the same problems are going to arise.
