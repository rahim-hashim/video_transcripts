# Noam Chomsky - Taxpayers Make the Investments, Corporations Take the Profits
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [August 06, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4ZIhW5ZpaE)
*  You have mostly have say iPhones or something like that in your pocket. Take
*  a look at them. They for example they have in them a GPS where the GPS come
*  from. It's created by the US Navy, the Navistar program. It has microelectronics,
*  software, hardware. It created almost all created for decades mostly in the state
*  sector under often in the US Pentagon funding here the counterpart. Taxpayers
*  pay for this because they think they're protecting their security. That's what
*  they're told. But in fact the government doesn't care about your security. What it
*  cares is about its own power and security for corporate power. And the way
*  the system works is the taxpayer takes the risks, carries out the investment for
*  decades, literally decades. Finally something may come out which is
*  profitable and then the profit goes to the private sector. If we had anything
*  remotely like capitalist systems we don't. They would adhere to the
*  capitalist principle that if an investor takes risks and you know invests and
*  waits and takes risky steps and if something comes out of it the profit
*  goes back to the investor. That's not the way it works here. The profit goes to
*  people had nothing to do with it. The risks are taken by you often through the
*  Pentagon and comparable systems and if anything comes out the profits go to
*  Microsoft and Apple. They didn't create it. They take it. It's given to them.
*  And it literally is decades. So computers were the first the computer market
*  personal computer market became viable in 1977 I think it was. Apple was the
*  first. That was about 30 years after the development of computers almost all in
*  the state sector like in the building where I work and it's the same if you
*  buy pharmaceuticals let's say the research the basic research and
*  development is pretty much done in the state sector. Places like probably the
*  biology lab right here probably gets government funding grants and that's all
*  across the board. When you look back at these I mentioned the Trans-Pacific
*  Partnership. One part of that was leaked by WikiLeaks. It's secret except for the
*  corporate lawyers and lobbyists but one part was leaked it was on the part on
*  intellectual property. Intellectual property is a polite term a kind of a
*  euphemism for government instituted monopoly pricing rights. That's what it
*  really means. It means extraordinarily high patent rights which have never
*  existed in history for the pharmaceutical corporations and some
*  other corporations. That's to keep the price of drugs up and make profits
*  astronomical. Now there's a pretext the pharmaceutical corporations say look we
*  need that for research and development. That's been investigated. Turns out that
*  probably at least half of the R&D is not done by the pharmaceutical corporations
*  at all. It's done by the state sector and so on and that's an underestimate
*  because if you take a close look the part that's done by the pharmaceutical
*  corporations is towards the marketing end like you know flip around a molecule
*  to get a new drug but the basic research the hard costly risky research that
*  that's done by people like you you pay for it through your taxes and the
*  pharmaceutical corporations rip off the profits.
