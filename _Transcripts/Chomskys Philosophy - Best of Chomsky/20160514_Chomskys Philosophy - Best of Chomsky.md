# Noam Chomsky - Perception and Introspection
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 14, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kj0Yxpi7kFE)
*  So I was interested in one comment you made about conscious and non-conscious processes
*  and how the functional aspect of your proposal is more or less non-conscious, whereas there's
*  a conscious component which is like our everyday lived experience, which is not going to be
*  able to introspect upon this functional system.
*  So I was wondering, more on a philosophical note, how exactly we're supposed to think
*  about phenomenal experience and kind of conscious experience in terms of its relationship to
*  functional relationships, like your, specifically your linguistic proposal, but then also other
*  domain specific proposals like perception.
*  There are those who don't believe that perception is modular or domain specific, that it's
*  embodied or something to that effect.
*  So I wonder if you had any proposed reflections on this kind of research now and how this
*  relates to kind of our phenomenal lived experience.
*  Well, let's take visual perception, which is relatively uncontroversial.
*  And take the one example that I gave, the rigidity principle.
*  When you're looking at that sequence of stochastic presentations, you perceive a rigid object
*  in motion.
*  You can't prevent yourself from perceiving that.
*  That's what you perceive, period.
*  The stimuli that are actually reaching your eyes, your retina, are just a series of as
*  few as three or four presentations on a tachistoscope, you know, screened with light,
*  of each of which has several dots on it.
*  Well, you have no way of introspecting into that.
*  Your phenomenal experience is a rigid object in motion.
*  But the stimuli that are hitting the retina are a very small number of presentations of
*  the few dots.
*  You can't introspect into that.
*  In fact, that's why it's a discovery.
*  It's kind of like the discovery of the chemical structure of coal or something.
*  You can't introspect into it.
*  So the phenomenal descriptions, they're useful, but they're useful as data.
*  They tell you very little about what's going on.
*  So it's kind of like everything else in the world, where you have data, but it doesn't
*  tell you much about what's going on.
*  That requires, that's why you have to take courses in physics and chemistry and so on,
*  because the data isn't transparent.
*  And it's hard for people to deal with.
*  But the same is true of our conscious lives.
*  We tend to take for granted, kind of like, you know, it's just normal that we can understand
*  everything about ourselves.
*  In fact, we don't understand anything about ourselves.
*  That's the crucial step that the human sciences really have not taken yet, for the most part,
*  that was taken in the natural sciences around the 17th century.
*  Just the willingness to be puzzled about things that look obvious.
*  Like what could be more obvious than if I let go of a cup that goes down instead of
*  up?
*  Well, you know, Galileo was willing to be puzzled about that.
*  That's why you take physics courses.
*  Before that, all you had to be told is things are going to their natural place.
*  And it's a big psychological step, even in studying the external world, even greater
*  in studying ourselves, because there we sort of feel that we know everything.
*  What's conscious must be what there is.
*  And in philosophy, modern philosophy, it's kind of a principle.
*  It happened to be John Searle, who I was quoting, but it's a widely accepted principle that
*  nothing can be a mental process unless it's accessible to consciousness.
*  And as I mentioned, if you look over the intellectual history, it's very hard to find anyone who
*  departed from this view.
