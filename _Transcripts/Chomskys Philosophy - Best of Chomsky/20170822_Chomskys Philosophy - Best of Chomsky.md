# Noam Chomsky - Dissidents
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [August 22, 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2TzUt8PcxQ)
*  Let's take Iran, okay? The duty of an Iranian dissident inside Iran is not to join the huge
*  chorus of condemnation of the crimes of Israel in the United States, though the crimes are very
*  real. The duty of an honest, honorable person in Iran would be to criticize the crimes of Iran,
*  and we understand that. In the old Soviet Union, we respected the dissidents,
*  Sakharov and others, because of their criticism of the crimes, repression, violence of their own
*  country. We didn't care what they said about the U.S. war in Vietnam. In fact, if they supported
*  who cared. We honored them for doing what they had to do within their own countries.
*  Same with Vassav Havel. We honor him because of his courageous struggle against repression and
*  violence where he was. The fact is that he did support U.S. crimes, but that's marginal.
*  Do you regard yourself as a dissident?
*  My case is quite different.
*  Are you a dissident, Professor?
*  Do I disagree with what does a dissident mean?
*  I don't know. You've been using the term.
*  That's an interesting term. We use the term conventionally is used in the United States
*  only for critics in enemy states. We don't call critics in the United States or its allies
*  dissidents. That's part of a propaganda system.
*  What would you call yourself?
*  A person who gives my opinion about international domestic affairs.
*  There's a flavor to your opinion.
*  It happens to be the kind of criticism which we call dissidents in enemy states. Therefore,
*  we should call it here to not accept the propaganda device of restricting it to enemies. We should
*  apply it to ourselves as well. I'm not comparable to the dissidents in the Soviet Union and Iran
*  for many reasons. For one thing, they're under much harsher repression, incomparably harsher.
*  Secondly, I do extensively condemn the crimes of enemies. They didn't, in fact, but I do,
*  so there's many differences.
