# Noam Chomsky - The War on Terror
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [March 22, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRNQyNHpaQY)
*  First of all, the phrase war on terrorism should always be used in quotes,
*  because there can't possibly be a war on terrorism. It's impossible.
*  The reason is it's led by one of the worst terrorist states in the world.
*  In fact, it's led by the only state in the world which has been condemned
*  by the highest international authorities for international terrorism,
*  namely the World Court, the Security Council, except that the US vetoed the resolution.
*  So we cannot even talk about a war on terrorism without self-ridicule.
*  Whatever is going on, you can like it or you can hate it or whatever,
*  but it's not a war on terrorism. It's some other thing.
*  There's been what's called a global war on terror.
*  When it began, there's been one device to deal with it, sledgehammer.
*  Smash them up. Don't find out what's going on. Smash them up.
*  What's happened?
*  15 years ago, it was confined to a tiny tribal area in Afghanistan.
*  Now it's all over the world.
*  Every time you hit it with a sledgehammer, you expand it.
*  Every single time. Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, everywhere.
*  Can you learn something from that?
*  Should we say, okay, let's smash them up again because they all want to kill us?
*  Yeah, that's one reaction. Another reaction is the same reaction,
*  which you do hear from people who know something about the topic,
*  like Scott Atron or like William Polk, well-known Middle East expert,
*  long experience in the US government, has pretty much the same proposals.
*  You have to deal with the situation rationally if you want to be, first of all, humane,
*  but even concerned with your own security.
