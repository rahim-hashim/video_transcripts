# Noam Chomsky - Empiricism and Rationalism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [November 29, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pndR7wrF-bo)
*  Centrally, your whole approach represents a rejection of the empirical tradition in philosophy, doesn't it?
*  Because, I mean, the very fact that you think that the empiricists are wrong about how we learn
*  must mean that they're wrong about knowledge and the nature of knowledge,
*  and the nature of knowledge has been the central problem in the whole empirical tradition of philosophy.
*  Well, the classical empiricist tradition, which I think was the tradition that's represented,
*  let's say perhaps in its highest form by Hume, seems to me to be a tradition of extreme importance
*  in that a particular theory of the origins of knowledge, in fact, of the science of human nature,
*  and Hume's phrase, was put forth, an empirical theory, and I think Hume, for example,
*  would have regarded it as an empirical theory, did regard it.
*  So when we investigate it, I think we discover that it's just completely false.
*  That is, that the mechanisms that he discussed are not the mechanisms by which the mind reaches states of knowledge,
*  that the states of knowledge attained are radically different than the kinds that he discussed.
*  For example, for Hume, the mind was, in his image, a kind of a theater in which ideas paraded across the stage,
*  and it therefore followed necessarily that we could introspect completely into the contents of our mind
*  if an idea is not on the stage, it's not in the mind, and the ideas may be connected and associated.
*  In fact, he went on to say there isn't even any theater, there's just the ideas, and in that respect the image is misleading.
*  Well, that's a theory, and in fact it's a theory that has had an enormous grip on the imagination throughout most of,
*  to my knowledge, most of the history of Western thought.
*  For example, that same image dominates the rationalist tradition as well,
*  where it was assumed that one could exhaust the contents of the mind by careful attention.
*  You could really develop those clearer and distinct ideas and their consequences and so on.
*  And in fact, even if you move to someone like Freud with his evocation of the unconscious,
*  still I think that a careful reading suggests that he regarded the unconscious as in principle accessible.
*  That is, we could really perceive that theater and stage and the things on it carefully,
*  if only the barriers of repression and so on could be overcome.
*  Well, if what I've been suggesting is correct, that's just, that's radically wrong.
*  I mean, even wrong is a point of departure.
*  There is no reason at all that I can see for believing that the principles of mental computation
*  that enter so intimately into our action or our interaction or our speech,
*  to believe that those principles are at all accessible to introspection,
*  any more than the analyzing mechanisms of our visual system or for that matter,
*  the nature of our liver is accessible to introspection.
*  It seems to me that over and over again you come back to the same point.
*  That is to say that many of the particular problems discussed and theories put forward by philosophers in the main,
*  but also psychologists, you've just mentioned Freud and in your writings you mentioned many others,
*  are in fact theories about physical processes.
*  They are therefore open to checking by investigation.
*  And when you check my investigation, you find out that the theories are wrong.
*  And therefore you are, as it were, radically subversive of a lot of very well established theories in our tradition.
*  It seems to me that what you put forward in their place over and over again,
*  in fact does parallel the rationalist tradition.
*  I said in my introduction to this program that what I'm always reminded of by your work is the theories of Kant.
*  You seem to me to be almost redoing in terms of modern linguistics what Kant was doing.
*  Do you accept any?
*  Well, I not only accept truth in it, but I've tried to bring it out in a certain way.
*  However, I haven't myself specifically referred to Kant,
*  but rather to the, primarily to the 17th century tradition of the continental Cartesians and the British Neoplatonists
*  who developed many of the ideas that are now much more familiar in the writings of Kant.
*  For example, the idea of experience conforming to our mode of cognition or the,
*  well, particularly in the British Platonists, for example,
*  there are, I believe, is a rich line of insight into the organizing principles of the mind by which experience is structured.
*  In fact, I think that's some of the richest psychological,
*  some sorts of psychological insights that I know.
*  And that's the one.
*  It's this tradition that I think can be fleshed out and made more explicit by the kinds of empirical inquiry that are now possible.
*  Of course, I think we also have to diverge from that tradition in a number of respects.
*  I've mentioned one, namely the belief that the contents of the mind are open to introspection.
*  Similarly, there's certainly no reason to accept the metaphysics of that tradition to believe that there's a dualism of mind and body.
*  I mean, you can see why the Cartesians were led to that.
*  It was a rational move on their part, but it's not a move that we have to follow.
*  We have other ways of approaching that question.
