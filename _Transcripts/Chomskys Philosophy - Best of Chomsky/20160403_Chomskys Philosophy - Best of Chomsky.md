# Noam Chomsky - Western Support for Dictators
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [April 03, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNnjfv1YB1w)
*  The West has always supported dictators.
*  So take, say, the Arab Spring.
*  Up until the point where the army turned against the dictators, the U.S., Britain, and France
*  supported the dictators.
*  They supported Ben Ali in Tunisia and France, supported Mubarak in Egypt.
*  The leading ally of the United States and Britain is Saudi Arabia, which is the most
*  extreme Islamic fundamentalist state ally.
*  The West has nothing against dictators.
*  Supports them consistently.
*  What the West is concerned about is democracy.
*  That would be dangerous.
*  So the West will try to adjust what it does to reduce the threat of democracy and to try
*  to restore, in the case of the Arabs, North African states, to restore something like
*  the old regime but with new names.
*  So in Egypt, for example, the United States is reasonably happy with the Muslim Brotherhood,
*  which they don't care if they have Islamic, if they call for Sharia or something.
*  What they care about is that they accept neoliberal programs, which they do.
*  There are business-oriented parties which conform to U.S. global economic principles.
*  So they're more or less acceptable.
*  In fact, it takes a certain genius not to see what's going on because this is a pattern
*  that is repeated over and over again.
*  It's kind of a routine game plan.
*  When your favorite dictator is facing difficulties, what you do is support him to the last minute.
*  If it becomes impossible to support him, say if the army turns against him or the business
*  classes turn against him, then send him off somewhere and try to get rid of him.
*  Do passionate statements about your love of democracy, that's the role of the intellectuals,
*  and then try to restore the old regime.
*  It's been done over and over again.
*  So democracy is a very serious threat in all over the world, but in the Arab countries
*  too.
*  So the policies that are taken essentially are trying to restore the old regime as much
*  as possible, maybe with new names.
*  You can't do it totally, but as much as possible.
*  And that's exactly what you'd expect.
*  It's a traditional policy that's back as far back as the history of imperialism.
