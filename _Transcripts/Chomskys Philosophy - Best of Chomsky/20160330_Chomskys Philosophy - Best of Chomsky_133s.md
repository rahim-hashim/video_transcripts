# Noam Chomsky - Unused Capacities
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [March 30, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uJr2fRzIWE)
*  The brain has developed all sorts of capacities, many of which are never put to use.
*  I mean, we just know that for a fact.
*  Let's say, take another capacity which is more or less well understood, the number faculty.
*  That's like the language faculty.
*  You've got to know what a number is in order to learn anything about numbers.
*  How does a child know that after it's taught to count to six that there's going to be another one?
*  Why doesn't it end there, let's say?
*  How do you have the capacities that enable you to comprehend what a prime number is if you get that far?
*  Well, those capacities, whatever they are, they can't be learned because you just think through the logic of it.
*  You can't learn them unless you already have them, the usual story.
*  But those capacities were present in the human species long before they were ever used.
*  In fact, there are human societies today, which have the same genes we do in every relevant respect,
*  which in their entire hundreds of thousands of years of history have never used it.
*  Although you can quickly evoke the capacity in those species as soon as you present, you sort of give them right stimulation.
*  So these capacities are just sitting there, waiting.
*  I mean, why are they there?
*  Well, probably because they're piggybacking on some other capacity,
*  like it's been argued that they're piggybacking on the language capacity.
*  One curious fact about language is it has this odd property of discrete infinity.
*  It's an infinite digital system, which is extremely rare in the biological world.
*  So that's like the number faculty.
*  So maybe the number faculty is just kind of an abstraction from the linguistic faculty that doesn't look at its complicated properties
*  and just looks at its basic structure.
*  Well, that's a nice fairy tale, maybe true.
*  And if so, you'd have a number faculty around without it ever being used.
*  And there could be lots of other faculties like that.
*  I mean, the chances are, just on kind of grounds of biological plausibility,
*  that if there is a faculty sitting there that would contribute to reproductive success, if you used it, chances are it'll be used.
*  And that's just on grounds of plausibility.
*  You know, over a couple hundred thousand years somebody would have tried it and they would have succeeded and so on and so forth.
*  But that's about the level of what you can say in these areas.
