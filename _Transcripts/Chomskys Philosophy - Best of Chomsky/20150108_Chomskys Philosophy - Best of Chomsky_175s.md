# Noam Chomsky - Freedom of Speech I
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [January 08, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsdvYbG3U_U)
*  How and who do you think should regulate the content of media?
*  Well, I'm personally very skeptical about any form of regulation of any kind of speech.
*  Now, the media don't even begin to approximate freedom of speech.
*  I mean, this is the kind of freedom where people who own the place set the rules.
*  So that's not real freedom.
*  Nevertheless, the idea of, even in that kind of system,
*  heavily skewed towards extreme wealth,
*  personally, I'd be reluctant, I'm very reluctant to see any kind of regulation take place.
*  Freedom of speech is a really important value.
*  Over the centuries, we've, particularly in the United States, won a lot of,
*  you know, won substantial freedom of speech and I think we ought to preserve it.
*  However, with regard to the media, I think there's a much more serious question.
*  Should the media be democratized?
*  I mean, if the media are institutions of private power,
*  we can be quite sure that they're going to have a particular take on things.
*  They're going to give a picture of the world which, by and large,
*  reflects the interests of their owners and their advertisers and other centers of power in the society.
*  And that means that the attitudes and points of view and interests of the general public are going to be marginalized.
*  And I think the answer to that is not, you know, regulation, it's democratization.
*  The specific question of violence on the media is a hard one.
*  I think you have to have a balance between,
*  which is not easy to determine, between allowing full freedom of expression
*  and imposing some restrictions on what people are exposed to.
*  So, for example, even the most passionate advocate of freedom of speech
*  does not believe that, say, I have a right to go into your living room
*  and put up a pornographic poster or something.
*  That's, you might say, my inability to do that.
*  It's a restriction of freedom of speech, but I think everyone agrees with that.
*  When you move to a, say, poster in Times Square saying,
*  you know, I don't know, some obscene thing or disgraceful thing,
*  the issue becomes more complex because it's not really private space.
*  It's just the space where you are.
*  And the conflict between the right to private space
*  and the right to freedom of speech begins to be ambiguous.
*  When you go to the media, it becomes even more ambiguous.
*  It's, in a sense, private space.
*  I mean, that's, given the way the society is, you just kind of,
*  you know, you're not compelled, but you're at least driven to being exposed to it.
*  And therefore, what's on it is a kind of involvement in your private space,
*  but at a more remote step.
*  It's at this point that values become difficult and decisions become difficult.
*  However, my own bias, at least, would be against,
*  and I think the burden proof has to be on anyone
*  who wants to introduce any form of regulation, in my opinion.
