# Noam Chomsky - Reform or Revolution
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [June 15, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLAeNmRwY3I)
*  Well, you know, talk about...
*  I want you to think through these things carefully.
*  Let's think about a revolution.
*  I mean, if a revolution is going to be at all constructive,
*  not just establish some horrible dictatorship worse than you happened,
*  there's only one way it can come about.
*  That's if a large mass of the population, in fact, the larger majority,
*  come to recognize that changes that they want
*  cannot be instituted within the framework of existing institutions.
*  That means that if you're a real dedicated revolutionary,
*  you're a reformist.
*  There's no conflict between reform and revolution.
*  What you want to do is press the institutions as far as possible
*  to yield to just popular demands.
*  And if the population comes to recognize, look, it can't be done anymore,
*  okay, then you can talk about a revolution, but not before.
*  And if you look at people who are really interested in revolutions,
*  like Karl Marx, they press this all the time.
*  In fact, he even believed that in England,
*  the freest country of his day, parliamentary system,
*  England, the United States,
*  might be possible to establish a communist revolution
*  without any violence at all,
*  just by pressing forward within the framework of the institutions that they have.
*  Well, maybe so, maybe not, but that's the criterion.
*  So I think, just again, endorse what Juan and Amy said,
*  you have to try in every possible way to bring the changes,
*  about the changes that we think ought to be made by means that are available.
*  And going back to Occupy, I agree with Amy, it was a tremendous achievement,
*  but there's a gap.
*  The 99% have to participate, and that hasn't been achieved,
*  and that's pretty important.
*  It's good to bring it to public attention,
*  put it on the national agenda, get people to think about it,
*  but that's only the first step.
*  The next step is to engage the 99%,
*  and that's a hard task, just as it has been with every popular movement.
*  And you have to remember, if you look at the history of popular movements,
*  they have had successes.
*  It was a much freer, juster country than it was not that long ago,
*  but it's always partial successes.
