# Noam Chomsky on Economic Inequality
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [September 17, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBaVcHJtjk)
*  As far as inequality is concerned, it's been growing quite rapidly worldwide.
*  Every year, Oxfam, a leading development agency, publishes a detailed extensive report of the
*  state of poverty and inequality in the world.
*  In the year 2014, they found that about 90 individuals literally had half of total world
*  wealth, which is an extraordinary degree of inequality.
*  In the year 2015, their latest publication, which just appeared, the number has been reduced
*  from 90 to 62.
*  62 individuals hold half the world's wealth, and there are many very ugly consequences
*  this.
*  To take one example from the Oxfam report, they point out that five million children
*  are dying of starvation every year.
*  That means about 500 or so while we're meeting, 500 children starving while we're talking.
*  And they could very easily be saved.
*  The resources are certainly there to save them, but policy is designed so that it goes
*  to enriching the super rich and the powerful, not to saving millions of children from starvation.
*  There is an organization of the rich developed countries, the OECD, the 31 countries.
*  Among the OECD countries, the U.S. is at the extreme in both inequality and poverty.
*  Just quote from the latest OED report on this, it says, the share of top incomes in the past
*  year increased, especially in English speaking countries in the United States far more than
*  others.
*  And by top incomes, they mean the top 1%, by now a fraction of 1%.
*  That's where there's been an explosion of inequality, huge explosion, primarily in the
*  United States, also to some extent in other English speaking countries.
*  And poverty remains at extraordinary levels.
*  With regard to poverty and inequality, by most measures in the OECD studies, the United
*  States ranks with the poorest of the 31 countries.
*  It ranks alongside of Mexico and Turkey.
*  Poverty rates and inequality in the United States are much greater than poor or quite
*  poor European countries like Portugal.
*  This has been consistent over 50 years.
*  The same is true of measures of social justice.
*  That's measures that include things like infant mortality, hunger and so on.
*  Of the 31 OECD countries, the United States ranks 27th, right down to the bottom, right
*  along with Greece, only slightly above Mexico, Chile and Turkey.
*  But there is an associated and quite striking fact, which you perhaps have read about in
*  the newspapers.
*  It's recently been discovered that among the sector of the American population, less
*  educated whites, mainly white males, that means with only high school education, among
*  this large sector of the American population, life expectancy is actually declining.
*  That's something that is unheard of in rich societies.
*  Life expectancy continually rises.
*  The United States is not particularly high in life expectancy, but life expectancy should
*  reduce among a major sector of the population.
*  Less educated white males, that's unheard of.
*  These are surely consequence, all of this is surely a consequence of the neoliberal
*  policies of the past generation, deregulation, marketization, decline of public institutions
*  and so on.
*  It has led to a general in the United States and similar things or even worse elsewhere,
*  it's led to pretty much stagnation for much, in fact, the majority of the population, sometimes
*  decline.
*  Real wages, actual wages evaluated relative to inflation, real wages for male workers
*  are now at the level of about the late 1960s.
*  There's been considerable growth, but it's gone into very few pockets.
*  In the last couple of years, almost all the growth has gone into tiny percentage of the
*  wealthy population.
*  So there is in fact now this radical concentration of wealth, not in parts of the population
*  that are really productive.
*  Much of it is in financial institutions, which have a dubious and maybe even harmful effect
*  on the economy.
*  This is understood by the major powerful institutions.
*  For example, a couple of years ago, Citigroup, one of the major financial institutions, published
*  a report for the investors, the investors and the Citigroup deals with, and it urged
*  them to direct their investments to what they call the plutonomy index.
*  Plutonomy means the sector of the population, the wealthier sector of the population.
*  This is worldwide, incidentally.
*  a worldwide class system of very wealthy people.
*  And it says mostly in the United States, but also some elsewhere, some in China, some in
*  Saudi Arabia and so on, but primarily in the United States, that that's where the real
*  good investment opportunities are.
*  You can kind of disregard the rest, they're not important.
*  In fact, it's now common to divide the world's population into a plutonomy, which is the
*  upper sector of wealth and power and what's sometimes called the precariat, the people
*  who live precarious lives without security, without benefits in many countries, including
*  rich countries in Europe.
*  The unemployment among youth is extraordinarily high.
*  People are living at home into their 40s, can't start families, get no jobs.
*  And so that's the precariat, part-time jobs, no just the same in the United States that
*  take colleges and universities, which increasingly are hiring temporary workers, adjuncts, graduate
*  students, people of no protection can be dismissed easily or paid very little.
*  So that's the precariat.
*  So the world is kind of dividing into a plutonomy and a precariat.
*  And as many have pointed out by now, the super rich really inhabit a different world, a world
*  that barely has contact with the general population except to extract resources from them.
*  Well, there's much debate about the causes for all of this, turns out to be many complexities,
*  but there's ample evidence that it doesn't have to do with any economic laws, but to
*  largely with policy decisions, not economic necessity.
*  And if you look at the policy decisions keeping to the United States now, we should recognize
*  that the United States is different from other societies in many ways.
*  It's by far the richest society in the world with incomparable advantages.
*  That's been true since its founding.
*  In fact, throughout its history, the United States has been the richest or close to the
*  richest country in the world.
*  By the late 19th century, the US economy was greater than that of the other advanced societies
*  combined.
*  The 20th century just accelerated this.
*  I'll come back to it.
*  But that's one respect in which the United States has enormous advantages, huge territory,
*  relatively underpopulated once the indigenous population was eliminated or destroyed, enormous
*  internal resources, extraordinary security and so on.
*  But also to an unusual extent, the United States is a business run society.
*  That's partly the result of the fact that it didn't grow out of existing feudal institutions.
*  It became to a high extent run by the business world.
*  And that's revealed in many ways.
*  So take say voting, much on everybody's mind right now.
*  The United States has a pretty high abstention level of people who don't vote.
*  And that's been investigated with interesting results.
*  One of the leading scholars who studies contemporary electoral politics, Walter Dean Burnham, a
*  very distinguished scholar, about some years ago did a study, a careful study of the socioeconomic
*  profile of non-voters in the United States.
*  And what he discovered is that their socioeconomic profile matches those in Europe, similar societies,
*  those in Europe who vote for labor-based or social democratic parties.
*  That sector of the population in the United States just doesn't vote because nothing
*  represents them.
*  There are no such parties.
*  Just recently, Dean Burnham, same scholar, and Thomas Ferguson, a prominent political
*  scientist, did a very careful study of voting in the most recent election, 2014.
*  They did a careful county-by-county study of just what voting was like.
*  And they came out with a pretty spectacular conclusion.
*  It turned out that voting in that election was approximately the same as in the 1820s
*  when the vote was restricted to propertied white males.
*  2014, about the same level of voting, which tells you quite a lot about participation
*  in what's called a democratic society.
*  These results are amplified when we look at how people are represented by their own representatives.
*  There's a way of studying that major topic in academic political science.
*  You study the policies that the representatives vote for, that's public, and you study the
*  attitudes of the people who they represent, their preferences.
*  We know a great deal about that from extensive and quite reliable and consistent polls.
*  And it turns out that for about 70% of the population, the lower 70% on the income-wealth
*  scale, they're basically disenfranchised.
*  Their own representatives vote in ways dissociated, unrelated to their preferences.
*  As you move up the income-wealth scale, you get a little more influence on representatives.
*  And at the very top, which means really a fraction of 1%, policies are essentially made.
*  That's very good work on that by Mark Gillens, Larry Bartell, other mainstream political
*  scientists.
*  Now, there's a recent study by Gillens and Benjamin Page, a well-known political scientist
*  published at Princeton University, in which they investigated a couple hundred major decisions
*  that were made by the political system.
*  And they compared the decisions with popular attitudes.
*  Here's their conclusion.
*  I'll quote it.
*  Economic elites, I mean, tiny fraction of economic power.
*  Economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent
*  impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have
*  little or no independent influence.
*  The results provide substantial support for theories of economic elite domination and
*  for theories of biased pluralism, but not for theories of majoritarian electoral democracy
*  or majoritarian pluralism.
*  To decode to the political science rhetoric, what it means is, in simple words, the United
*  States is a plutocracy with some formal democratic elements that are increasingly at the margins.
*  And the public is aware of that.
*  They may not read, people don't have to read the political science journals to see it in
*  their lives.
*  We see it in much of what's happening now.
*  There have been polls about taxes for decades, regular polls.
*  Basically two questions.
*  People are asked, are your taxes too high?
*  And people say, yeah, I'd like to pay less taxes.
*  Are taxes on the rich too low?
*  Sure, the rich ought to pay much higher taxes.
*  That's consistent.
*  And it's very interesting.
*  There have been a few studies which showed that when these polls are reported, it's typically
*  the first question that's reported.
*  Taxes are too high, not the second question, which says taxes are too low on the wealthy.
*  Then you go back to the 1950s, the Eisenhower period, taxes on the wealthy were far higher.
*  The top rate was 90 percent.
*  In fact, it's been cut back regularly over the years in direct opposition to the popular
*  will.
*  So by now, in fact, the poor probably pay a larger percentage of their income than the
*  rich and taxes when you consider the whole array of largely regressive taxes, state,
*  local, social security, and so on.
*  These are all the effects of policy decisions in recent years which have led to the extreme
*  inequality and the maintenance of very high levels of poverty ever since the end of the
*  Second World War, picking up in the 1970s with the neoliberal programs.
*  And the net effect of it is what we see today.
*  of deregulation which have led to regular crises, concentration of wealth in financial
*  institutions, Bill Clinton's program of destroying the welfare system, ending welfare as we know
*  it, but a really seriously harmful effect on the people who need welfare, especially
*  women with dependent children.
*  Right now there are three million children in the United States who are living on less
*  than two dollars a day, lots of unskilled labor, which helps because there's a work
*  requirement which drives down wages, there's much else.
*  There's a kind of a vicious cycle.
*  The increase the concentration of wealth leads to concentration of political power, leads
*  to policy choices that increase the concentration of wealth and maintain poverty.
