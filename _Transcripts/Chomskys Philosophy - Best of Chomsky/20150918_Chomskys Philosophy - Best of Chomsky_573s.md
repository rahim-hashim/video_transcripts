# Noam Chomsky - Rousseau, Moral Progress, and Illegitimate Authority
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [September 18, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsaIc4J4ThU)
*  You wrote a wonderful essay called Language and Freedom.
*  Before I get there, though, it seems to me,
*  what the motivation to study language
*  was to understand something which you often
*  talk about as human nature.
*  I was going to ask you what, I still don't quite know what
*  the word, the phrase means, human nature.
*  But you seemed attracted to the notion
*  that understanding human nature would help us
*  understand social interactions, an issue that has been,
*  and clearly is very important to me, to get there.
*  And you were attracted and written a lot about Rousseau.
*  Now, I remember Rousseau, Jean-Jacques Rousseau,
*  had a big impact on me when I read The Social Contract
*  because of that famous phrase, man is born free,
*  but lives forever in chains, which took me a long time
*  to understand.
*  But Rousseau had this idea which, in your writing,
*  you've repeated a number of times,
*  that somehow the natural state of man,
*  and we'll just say he's man for that moment here,
*  is a good one, and somehow society screws that up.
*  So, for example, you wrote, actually at the time
*  of American draft resisters, you were saying,
*  many who were beginning to recover from the catastrophe
*  of 20th century Western civilization,
*  which is so tragically confirmed Rousseau's judgment.
*  And he wrote, here arose the national wars,
*  battles, murders, and reprisals,
*  which make nature tremble and shook reason,
*  and all those horrible prejudices which rank the honor
*  of shedding human blood among the virtues.
*  The most decent men learned to consider it one of their
*  duties to murder their fellow man.
*  At length, men were seen to massacre each other
*  by the thousands without knowing why.
*  More murders were committed on a single day of fighting,
*  and more horrors in the capture of a single city
*  than were committed in the state of nature
*  during whole centuries over the entire face of the earth.
*  Now, is that really, it seems to me that that's wrong.
*  That's Rousseau.
*  Yeah, it's Rousseau, but I mean, you quoted it.
*  And the question is, do you agree with that?
*  I mean, it seems to me that, in fact,
*  one of your former colleagues, Steve Pinker,
*  has written a book, The Better Angels of Our Nature,
*  that in fact, if you wanted to choose a time to be around
*  and have a happy, nonviolent life,
*  today is a lot better than when you're being around
*  at Neanderthal times.
*  Well, that's what he claims.
*  But the weight of evidence is strongly against it.
*  You think so?
*  I think so.
*  There's very good work by a serious anthropologist,
*  Brian Ferguson is one, who's worked through his data
*  and I think shown that it's probably wrong
*  for about 95% of human existence,
*  namely the hunter-gatherer periods.
*  It's really with the emergence of state systems,
*  the development of complex agriculture,
*  they begin to get wars that are very destructive.
*  I mean, there's killing among hunter-gatherers,
*  but it's pretty limited.
*  But there has been moral progress.
*  In fact, you wrote.
*  Well, one thing that he says is correct.
*  I think that's about it.
*  Since the enlightenment, there has been moral progress.
*  In our own lifetimes, there's been moral progress.
*  So consider, for example, the status of women's rights
*  today and in 1950.
*  Very different.
*  The status of civil rights, very different.
*  The gay rights, very different.
*  That's progress.
*  And it's been going on slowly since the enlightenment.
*  But that's a pretty brief period of human history.
*  And in fact, right at this same time,
*  have been the most murderous, destructive wars ever.
*  And even the 70 years ago,
*  the creation by some of the smartest people in the world
*  of a device that may destroy us all
*  and is on the verge of destroying us all.
*  We'll get to that.
*  As you know, I'm the chairman of the board
*  of the bone and the atomic scientists.
*  It's an issue that's really of great interest to me.
*  You actually just reproduced a quote
*  I was gonna talk about for you.
*  Is it that there has been moral progress
*  in many ways, status of women,
*  in particular, you talk about your daughters
*  versus your grandmother.
*  And you say it's fairly brief,
*  but don't you think it's interesting
*  that that coincides with the rise of science?
*  Do you think that's coincidental?
*  No, it's not coincidental.
*  Part of the contribution of the enlightenment
*  was to free inquiry from constraints
*  which led to the rise of science.
*  So breaking free of these fetters that society had imposed
*  did permit the rise of science,
*  it did permit moral progress,
*  also permitted massive destruction.
*  Well, now we're gonna get to the massive destruction
*  and you're interested in that.
*  You wrote at one point,
*  and the transition in this language and freedom,
*  which is really trying to understand
*  whether your scientific and intellectual background
*  somehow motivated in some sense your social activism.
*  You can say whatever you want.
*  Take a look at the first sentence.
*  The first sentence of this article says,
*  I've been asked to talk about language and freedom.
*  There's a lot to say about language.
*  There's a lot to say about freedom,
*  but I have almost nothing to say about and.
*  Okay, but here's one of the things.
*  How are they connected?
*  Here's one of the things you did say,
*  which I find interesting,
*  which I wanna ask if it motivates you, okay?
*  I mean, I like to believe that the intensive study
*  of one aspect of human psychology, human language,
*  may contribute to a humanistic social science
*  that will serve as well as an instrument for social action.
*  I would like to believe that's crucial.
*  Yes, I would like to believe that.
*  Has that been your, has that been a motivator?
*  No, no, no, I'm not saying you say it has,
*  but in a personal sense,
*  do you think that makes a connection
*  in your own personal activism?
*  Well, if you look at as a historical fact,
*  no, they're separate,
*  but there is a kind of a connection,
*  not a logical connection, nothing you can prove,
*  just a suggestive relation, and it shows up in Rousseau.
*  So if you take a look at say,
*  the work of Rousseau that I quoted,
*  which is the second discourse on equality,
*  that's his most libertarian writing.
*  He begins with a pretty strictly Cartesian view
*  of animals as being machines,
*  just reflexive machines compelled to do what they do
*  by internal and external circumstances
*  without the creative character
*  of human thought and behavior.
*  And he then says, again, in roughly Cartesian terms,
*  that what is unique and distinctive about humans
*  is this internal creative capacity.
*  That's what makes humans different
*  from the rest of the natural world.
*  Then comes a thesis, which is not proved,
*  but I think is plausible,
*  namely any social arrangements
*  that inhibit or constrain that free creative capacity
*  are fundamentally illegitimate
*  unless they can justify themselves.
*  That means any structure of authority, domination, hierarchy,
*  whether it's in a patriarchal family
*  or in international affairs or anything in between
*  should be subject to challenge.
*  It's not self-justifying.
*  And you can see the chain of thinking.
*  Notice it's not a proof,
*  but beginning with the observation
*  that specific to human nature,
*  a term which I don't object to,
*  we could talk about that,
*  inherent to human nature, what's special about us
*  is this creative character,
*  the need to inquire, to create,
*  to act, to choose what you do, how you speak,
*  how you interact and so on.
*  There's kind of a chain of thinking from that
*  to the conclusion that social,
*  which is inverse O in fact,
*  that social structures which inhibit that
*  are illegitimate unless proved otherwise.
*  Like sometimes you can give an argument
*  in favor of authority.
*  So if I'm walking down the street
*  with say my three-year-old granddaughter
*  and she runs into the street
*  and I grab her arm and pull her back,
*  I think I can give a justification for that.
*  But the point is that any,
*  the argument is that any form of authority
*  and domination requires justification.
*  And usually you can't justify it,
*  in which case you have to dismantle it
*  and replace it by something more free and just.
