# Noam Chomsky - Libertarian Marxism
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [June 22, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvMgtWMk4uk)
*  The Russian system was finally collapsing. I was asked by a leftist journal to write an article on
*  what does it mean when socialism collapses and I wrote an article. I said this is a small victory
*  for socialism if this goes. Then I explained why. They refused to publish it. It finally appeared in
*  an anarchist journal in Montreal but I actually wrote something like that for the nation in a symposium
*  they had. I don't think anybody understood a word of what I was saying. Even the people who were
*  strong anti-Stalinists and so on. But I think that's true. Now out of the Marxist movement
*  there came another strain. People like well-known people. Anton Panacuk,
*  head of the Second International Educational System, Carl Korsh, others that are here like
*  Paul Mattock. They were strict Marxists but they had a different position. They were very opposed
*  to Bolshevism. In fact, Lenin had a famous pamphlet about them. They called the ultra-left infantile
*  something or other. That was kind of left-wing Marxism. It wasn't very far from anarcho-syndicalism.
*  In fact, they were pretty close relations. A lot of these people were very much in favor of the
*  Spanish revolution, anarchist revolution. So there was that strain. They wanted workers' control in
*  factories. Elimination of the party hierarchy. They were very anti-Leninist. Although they were some
*  of the leading figures in the Marxist movement, that was disparate. Who's read Panacuk? But
*  you have. Okay, who else? In fact, the stuff didn't even reach the West until the 1950s.
*  Then there was of course the whole left libertarian movements. Anarchists, anarcho-syndicalists,
*  also other people. But that didn't become socialism. Socialism became Lenin, or else social
*  democracy. A German social democracy which was kind of reformist, parliamentary social democracy,
*  which did do things for workers' rights and women's rights and so on and so on. But it's
*  within the framework of state capitalist democracies. So that was socialism. But the
*  real socialist movement was pretty much crushed.
