# Noam Chomsky - Financialization of the Economy
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [March 12, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVB6Sz0bn6Q)
*  The economy has changed dramatically in the last 35 years.
*  There's been a major process of, conscious process of,
*  financialization of the economy and kind of exporting of productive industry.
*  It's very conscious and it's not particularly obscure why.
*  By about that time it was possible to make more profit
*  in shenanigans of money manipulation than in doing anything productive.
*  And in market societies, people with capital go for what's profitable.
*  One corollary to that was that the political pressure just dismantled the regulatory apparatus
*  with the support of economists incidentally working with economic theories.
*  It's astonishing that they're not ashamed of themselves, but anyway, that's what happened.
*  One consequence of this, one aspect of it is that for roughly 30 years, a little over that,
*  for the majority of the population, real wages have pretty close to stagnated.
*  A little growth, but not much. That's most of the population.
*  Families get by with two husband and wife working.
*  We have very limited support systems as compared to other countries,
*  so that means families are in trouble and that shows up in all kind of ways.
*  You can keep your income up by asset inflation and by debt.
*  The asset inflation of course can't last, so you have repeated bubbles of collapsing.
*  The last one was an $8 trillion housing bubble, which amazingly almost no economist could see.
*  The trend line in housing prices is going way beyond a 100-year record.
*  There was no reason for it. It was obviously going to burst.
*  That's the assets of most people. They're in trouble. People are in deep trouble.
*  Not trouble like Central Africa, but that's not the way you evaluate your circumstances.
*  You ask, what should I be able to have in a rich country like this?
*  They also see ostentatious wealth. It's quite striking that for a while after the financial collapse,
*  the super rich were kind of playing it cool, so they tried to not be too ostentatious.
*  It doesn't look nice, but now it's over.
*  The New York Times a couple days ago had a front page article describing exactly this phenomenon.
*  Back to great parties, gala events, showing off how rich we are.
*  Another article on the same issue said corporate profits have broken records.
*  Banks have so much money they don't know what to do with it.
*  People may not know the details, but they can see this, and they can see what's happening in their own lives.
*  In the manufacturing industry, unemployment is about at the rate of the Great Depression.
*  I'm old enough to remember that. It was bad.
*  There was a kind of hopefulness.
*  I know my relatives are mostly unemployed workers, but they were not desperate.
*  They were poor, but not desperate, because it looked like something could happen.
*  We could do things together. There's a better future.
*  My seamstress aunts who were unemployed were in the garment workers union, and they got some benefits from that.
*  They also felt that some educational programs, cultural programs, they felt that we can get out of this working together.
*  People don't feel that now.
*  Those manufacturing jobs are not coming back, not unless we have quite a different social order here.
*  There's plenty of need for them.
*  In fact, what's happening in this respect is sometimes almost surreal.
*  For example, the government effectively owned most of the auto industry for a while,
*  and the policies they were pursuing was closing down plants, just like GM had been doing.
*  At the same moment, Obama's transportation secretary was in Europe,
*  traveling around Spain, trying to get contracts using stimulus money for Spanish factories
*  to produce high-speed transport for the United States,
*  which we desperately need, as anyone who's taken a train here knows.
*  These things could be produced very well in Michigan and Indiana,
*  maybe not profitable for the bankers, but certainly good for the workforce and the communities.
*  But that wasn't even considered an option.
*  Green technology, which is supposed to be the expanding area,
*  go to China, go to Spain, go to Germany.
*  I mean, investors in the United States, the last figures I saw,
*  are investing, I think, about twice as much in China as they are in the United States and Europe combined.
*  And in Germany, Spain, France, there's substantial.
*  And China will presumably be the leader, if it isn't already, in wind and solar technology.
*  Can't that be done here? Sure it can.
*  In fact, a lot of the high technology, the innovations, the ideas come from here,
*  but they're produced there.
*  China is kind of like an assembly plant,
*  where the surrounding industrial area in the United States
*  assemble the products that come back here that we buy, but it could be produced here.
*  That takes different social policies.
*  And as long as policy is in the hands of financial institutions
*  and production corporations, like, say, General Electric GM,
*  which are themselves financial institutions, it's a lot of their business,
*  they make plenty of money if it's done somewhere else.
