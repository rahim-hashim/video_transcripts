# Noam Chomsky - The Nation State
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [April 01, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVoB2fGBrFc)
*  I mean the nation state altogether is a pretty artificial construct.
*  I mean nation states were established almost entirely by violence and they bring together
*  and they force into a single mold people who often have little to do with one another.
*  They speak different languages, they have different cultures, they have different traditions,
*  different religions, you know, and the effort to mold them into a single entity where they're all
*  subjected to the same fixed national culture and social commitments, service to state power and so
*  on. That's been pretty hard. Even the effort to establish borders has been a very, very violent
*  process. Europe was the most savage place in the world for centuries while the nation state system
*  was being imposed. Finally Europe is now free from internal wars. There's a lot of debate about the
*  reason in the political science literature, you know, talk about the democratic peace and so on.
*  My feeling is the reason is the basic reason is quite different. The Europeans did recognize,
*  had to recognize in 1945 that if they ever try to fight another war they'll just wipe out everything.
*  You can't fight wars with that degree of destructive power in your hands. So therefore
*  it moves to a period of more or less peaceful integration. But if you look around the world
*  where there are conflicts raging all over the place, virtually all of them have to do with
*  nation state systems and boundaries that were imposed by the imperial powers almost everywhere.
*  Let's say take Iraq. The British carved out Iraq in their own interests, not in the interests of
*  the people of the region. And there are sharp differences among them, the Kurds and the Shiites
*  and so on. Furthermore Britain drew the boundaries of Iraq for their own interests. Again they
*  drew the northern boundaries so that Britain, not Turkey, would be able to exploit the oil resources.
*  They drew the southern boundaries so that Iraq would be almost landlocked. That's why the
*  principality of Kuwait was separated out. And if you look around, Africa is the same thing,
*  Asia, let's say take Pakistan. The British drew a line called the Durand Line separating what was
*  India from Afghanistan, now separates Pakistan from Afghanistan. The line cuts right through
*  the Pashtun area, kind of Pashtunistan. The Pashtun never accepted it, the Afghans never accepted it.
*  Now if people cross that border, we call them terrorists, they may be going home.
*  The same is true of just about every, let's say the U.S.-Mexico border. That was established by a
*  war of aggression in which the U.S. conquered half of Mexico. You take a look at the names of the
*  cities in the southwest and western United States, San Francisco, San Diego, Santa Cruz, Spanish names.
*  People went, it was a pretty open border for a long time. People went up and back for work, for
*  visiting relatives, cultural reasons, commercial, whatever. The border has been slowly militarized.
*  The sharp increase in militarization was actually in 1994, and that was connected with NAFTA,
*  the so-called Free Trade Agreement. U.S. officials understood perfectly well and in fact said that
*  the effect of NAFTA will likely be to drive impoverished Mexicans across the border.
*  NAFTA is going to essentially wipe out Mexican agriculture. Mexican campesinos can be perfectly
*  efficient, but they cannot compete with highly subsidized U.S. agribusiness, so they'll be
*  driven off the land. That's still happening. Right now, people are, campesinos are being driven
*  off the land. Well, what do they do? A lot of them come north, so you get an illegal immigration
*  problem. You have to militarize the border. Things like that are going on all over the world. I mean,
*  I remember it struck me very, not that I didn't know it, but it struck me very dramatically
*  60 years ago. My wife and I were students. We were living in Israel, and we were kind of hitchhiking,
*  students, backpacks. We were hitchhiking up in northern Israel, and we were just walking one
*  evening. A car, a jeep came along on a road behind us, and the guy got out of the jeep and
*  started yelling at us in Hebrew and told us, you've got to come back. What had happened is we'd walked
*  into Lebanon. At that point, the border was unmarked now. I suppose it's bristling with
*  tanks and so on. The border was just artificially drawn right through the Galilee
*  by the British and the French for their own purposes. It had nothing to do with the people
*  there. The same is true almost everywhere. One of the reactions to all of this is the kind of
*  coalescence of more or less coherent groups, totally so, into regions where they feel more
*  comfortable in running their own affairs.
