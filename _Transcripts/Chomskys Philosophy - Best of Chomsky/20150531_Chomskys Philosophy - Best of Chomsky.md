# Noam Chomsky on Privatization
**Chomsky's Philosophy - Best of Chomsky:** [May 31, 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nd_lJCWOUM)
*  There's a standard way of privatizing something, like when Margaret Thatcher
*  wanted to privatize the British railroads, the technique was defund them.
*  And then when they don't work, people get angry and say let's do something. So you
*  hand it over to private enterprise which totally ruins them and then the state
*  has to come back in, big cost, and try to reconstruct it somehow. It's known as
*  privatization. And that's exactly what's happening with social security.
*  It's in good shape now when you read in the newspapers as you do that the big
*  problem of the deficit is entitlement. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid.
*  Social Security is a zero problem. For one thing it doesn't add anything to the
*  deficit because people pay for it. And for another thing it's in pretty good
*  shape. Certainly, well, the last of the famous baby boomers will be gone
*  before there's any problem in it. That's why there's a big payroll tax increase
*  30 years ago to ensure that. But if it's defunded it'll be a problem. Then there'll
*  be pressure to privatize it. That's a huge bonanza for the financial
*  institutions. It'll put trillions of dollars into their hands which they can
*  then use to make a ton of money with risky investments which are therefore
*  very profitable. And when it tanks, as it will, when the economy tanks, there's a
*  technique. You pick up your copies of Milton Friedman and Hayek and Ayn Rand and
*  you run to the nanny state that you've nurtured and you make sure that they
*  bail you out. That's really existing capitalism. And it means that the scam
*  can go on. Like take privatizing schools. What's the point of privatizing schools?
*  Well, you know, the idea is to instill in people the idea that all you care about
*  is yourself. So I don't happen to have children of school age so therefore
*  according to the ideology that's implanted in you, I'm not supposed to
*  care whether the kid down the street has school to go to. So I don't want to pay
*  taxes. You know, I want to cut taxes because I don't care if that kid goes to
*  school. And if, you know, since I have enough money I could send my kid to
*  private school if I wanted to. So who cares if they're public schools? So we
*  should privatize schools to eliminate the conception that we should care if
*  some other kid goes to school, which everybody has. You've got to drive it out of
*  their heads. The same is true, I don't know if it's happening here, of efforts
*  to privatize pension and security systems. What's the point of that? Like in the US,
*  these big effort to try to privatize social security. I mean, financially
*  speaking it's ridiculous. It's a huge cost and everything else. But there are
*  reasons for it. Social security is based on an unacceptable principle, namely that
*  each person that you should care if the disabled widow across town survives. And
*  you're not supposed to care about that. You're supposed to care about whether
*  you have enough pairs of shoes and stuff like that, you know, enough cars and video
*  games or whatever it is. That's all you're supposed to care about. So you
*  got to privatize social security. Also another advantage to privatizing social
*  security is that it has the brilliant consequence of turning working people
*  against their own interests. Because if your pension is tied up in stocks, you
*  want to make sure those stocks go up. And the way those stocks go up is by
*  cutting wages and reducing working conditions and sending jobs to Chinese
*  sweatshops and so on. So as a working person you should, you have to be
*  committed to undermining your own interests. And that's important. So for
*  reasons like that you want to privatize social security and privatize water and
*  schools and everything else. By definition, privatization undercuts
*  democracy. It takes something out of the public arena and puts it into the hands of
*  unaccountable private tyrannies that are created and supported by the state, which
*  is what corporations are. Remember all this privatization you hear about, it's
*  supposed to be very efficient. And by some measure, you know, by some ludicrous
*  measure it probably is efficient. You know, and part of the reason why it's
*  efficient is you don't count the costs, okay? So like if you suppose they're
*  talking about privatizing the MTA around, you know, the public transportation
*  thing, all right. Suppose you privatize the system. You and I know how to make it
*  more efficient by the economist's measures. You throw out union workers and
*  you get temps for half the price. And if there's an accident because they never
*  had any training, well it's just people are getting killed, you don't measure
*  that. And you cut off the so-called unprofitable bus routes, okay, or subway
*  routes. Like you don't make a lot of money at 11 p.m., okay, so let's throw
*  them out. Well suppose somebody stuck somewhere at 11 p.m. and wants to get
*  home. Oh well, you know, it's entrepreneurial values, you know, let them
*  hire a limousine or something, you know. And in ways like that you can make the system more
*  efficient simply by transferring the costs over to the public where you don't
*  measure the costs, okay. So, you know, it looks nice and efficient on some, you know,
*  economists' paper, but of course you just, there's huge costs transferred over the
*  public which you don't measure.
