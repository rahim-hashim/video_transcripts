**All In Podcast:** [September 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE)
*  You want to see something? Look at my eyes. Look at his eyes. Fucking contagion over here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=0.0s)]
*  Broski what happened? You have conjunctivitis? Yeah, double eye. I got it from my daughter. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=5.76s)]
*  He got something in his eye. And then I got this like fucking allergic reaction to it. It is a [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=9.92s)]
*  I'm just messed up dude for two days now. I haven't been able to see. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=14.32s)]
*  Okay, well, let me tell you about this weekend, which was the most motherfucking exhausting [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=16.8s)]
*  weekend of my life. I mean, where do I even start? Okay, here's here's where I start. So [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=21.44s)]
*  I fucking fly home from Italy, from Italy, get back in the arena 35,000 feet, I decide to troll [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=26.08s)]
*  the mids. We'll talk about that later. But anyways, sipping a beautifully chilled white burgundy [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=33.12s)]
*  by trolling the mids, you mean that you were occupying their airspace. You were flying at [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=39.76s)]
*  the level of commercial jets to fly by 45,000 feet instead of 45,000 feet, I went to down where [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=45.28s)]
*  the public airlines fly and I was like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, mid, mid, mid came back. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=50.88s)]
*  I landed in LA and I go straight to the house. I landed like, you know, I get there like 130 [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=74.88s)]
*  or 230 or something three o'clock something on there. In the morning, I take a quick one in the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=80.8s)]
*  afternoon, take a nice bath. And boom, we start playing at four o'clock. Okay, we start playing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=84.72s)]
*  for this. Not a big deal. It's like one day of poker, we play poker, we finish at like three or [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=89.28s)]
*  four in the morning, we're exhausted. Kevin shows up in a wheelchair, because he had pulled his [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=93.44s)]
*  fucking abdomen. Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart in a race with Steven Ridley, he had a 40 yard dash with [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=98.16s)]
*  Steven pulled all this muscles like door. I think you made a 40 inch dash if it was Kevin Hart, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=103.44s)]
*  that's a 40 inch dash. Anyways, Kev, Kev pulls all these muscles, the door in the car opens and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=109.76s)]
*  wheelchair comes and he wheels himself to the table. And so that was the beginning. I was like, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=115.12s)]
*  this is like a this is an odd way to start poker. We played till four in the morning, go to bed, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=121.44s)]
*  wake up, do our thing, start the game again Thursday at four. Okay. We play again till fucking three or [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=127.12s)]
*  four in the morning. Wake up, we go to Burbank at 10 and we fly to Puerto Vallarta for a bachelor [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=135.2s)]
*  party. It's unbelievable. Okay, 10 bedrooms, huge compound on the beach, the whole nine yards. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=140.72s)]
*  We start gambling on the plane. I just want you guys to know that we slept nine hours and four [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  days. And we just kept playing and playing and playing at one point said, and this is exactly [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  how the interaction with said, Hey guys, maybe we should go to the St. Regis for dit. And then as [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=160.24s)]
*  soon as he was about to say dinner, I was like, shut up, keep playing. The point is that we played [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  from the plane in the car, we played on an app that we played in the house. The food was served [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=172.8s)]
*  buffet style. It all decorum just went away. We didn't do anything. We didn't leave that house. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  We didn't walk on the beach. We didn't fucking nothing. You didn't put your feet in the ocean. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=184.8s)]
*  I played until I landed in Moffat on Monday afternoon. Can you fucking believe it? It's like [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=189.12s)]
*  almost like, you know, six days straight of poker. I will say this. It's an incredible house. The [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=196.72s)]
*  food was incredible. I really wish I could have seen more than my bedroom and the poker table. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=202.24s)]
*  I wish I could tell you that the Pacific Ocean was nice. I have no fucking idea. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  You peed in a bucket. You didn't even see the bathrooms in this house. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=213.04s)]
*  No, I had the doors open so that I could run to my room and pee and come back. I mean, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=216.24s)]
*  it was the most degen weekend I've ever been a part of. And then all of us, by the way, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=223.52s)]
*  we're so exhausted. We slept for fucking 10 hours a day for the like the last three days. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=227.68s)]
*  Oh, I know. And by the way, so smart, you know, you think it's about your party. It's like, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=232.08s)]
*  there'll be girls have been nothing. Not even the housekeepers were women. Everybody was man. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=235.68s)]
*  And it's just all dudes dudes cleaning out dudes cooking dudes, dudes doing this dude. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=240.0s)]
*  I want to attempt to go off site to go to a dinner. It was like, No, sit down. The best. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=249.92s)]
*  He's the best that should pay for some tequila research. He's the best. My Lord, I just want to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=254.72s)]
*  I don't want to make this into tequila part two, but my email is filled with 8000 word tequila [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=260.08s)]
*  missives and overviews from Friedberg and every tequila producer in the world. And my Twitter, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=266.96s)]
*  my ex is filled with posts about Chumot's man in the arena comments they have set off [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=273.12s)]
*  an absolute fury as Chumot was alluding to. So the man in the arena tweet, I don't know the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=278.56s)]
*  timestamp here. It looks like 1022am. I don't know what that is Italian time, but Chumot decided to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=285.2s)]
*  say I'm in the arena trying stuff, some will work someone but always learning. You're anonymous and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=291.76s)]
*  afraid of your own shadow enjoy the sidelines. And this of course was to somebody who is criticizing [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=296.48s)]
*  a SPAC or something. And I think this person had eight followers. And let's just go through [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=301.6s)]
*  the memes here. Here somebody with the AI revolution has made a Chumot version of gladiator [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=306.72s)]
*  Russell Crowe and Chumot's DNA being mixed. Friedberg I didn't know this was possible in [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=312.64s)]
*  DNA today. But I guess there is a new actor storming Hollywood and it's Chumot Crowe. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=318.24s)]
*  It's Russell Polly Hoppetea. Beautiful. I mean, what a great job that is. Great job. Looks like [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=325.52s)]
*  you. So great job to whatever mids did that in whatever mid software. Do you want to actually [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=330.72s)]
*  talk about the man in the arena comment and what the context of it is? Can we talk about that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=335.76s)]
*  actually? Yeah, I think people got upset because what I said was the truth. And this is no different [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=340.16s)]
*  than when I've said stuff before. That's become a huge meme and a huge moment, cultural moment. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=346.24s)]
*  Telling the truth, especially when it's so clear and so obvious, sometimes can really touch a nerve. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  And what I said is basically the following, which is that there are all these people, the four of us [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=358.0s)]
*  are examples who are constantly doing things. And then we come into X and we don't confuse X with [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=364.0s)]
*  the arena. You know, we don't do stuff in X. We talk on X. But then you go back and you actually [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=371.2s)]
*  do things. You start companies, you invest in businesses, you incubate ideas, you help founders [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=378.47999999999996s)]
*  get their businesses off the ground. Those are meaningful things and success is never guaranteed. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=383.28s)]
*  But there is a small strain of people who just violently either hate themselves or hate the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=388.88s)]
*  fact that you're doing things and then that you talk about them. And I think what this touched was [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=396.56s)]
*  just that in a simple nutshell, it forced people to confront the fact that, hey, hold on a second, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=402.0s)]
*  am I this anonymous rube on the sideline that just throws shade or am I actually doing stuff? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=407.52s)]
*  Here, I just wanted to take an actual direct line of attack on people who are constantly blaming [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=412.72s)]
*  others for everything. And if you aren't trying and iterating, you're a fucking loser. Go out and [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=418.96s)]
*  try something. And whether it works or not, X is a great place to then go and talk about it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=425.68s)]
*  That's the cycle. Sachs, your thoughts on the man in the arena? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=432.32s)]
*  Well, look, I think speaking of crazy, politically motivated witch hunts, did you see this latest [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=436.16s)]
*  story today that now there's a new government investigation of Elon, they're investigating him [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=441.12s)]
*  for supposedly Tesla was going to build him a glass house. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=448.16s)]
*  Which he said is ridiculous. It's not true. So the administration, you know, I guess to turn a [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=451.6s)]
*  phrase, people who live in glass houses shouldn't be investigating glass houses. You have the Biden [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=461.04s)]
*  administration now, the latest revelations is that Biden was using a pseudonym in the [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=465.52000000000004s)]
*  mouse and emails and he was emailing Hunter Biden under the name Robert Peters. Why would you do that [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=471.6s)]
*  about Burisma? So this is how they were communicating. First, Biden said he said [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=479.68s)]
*  remember at Yahoo.com first, Biden said, I don't know anything about my son's business. Then it [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=488.16s)]
*  turns out based on the sworn testimony of Devin Archer, who is Hunter Biden's partner, that Biden [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=493.36s)]
*  participated in over 20 phone calls where he would call in when they were in the room with clients to [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=499.04s)]
*  quote be the brand. And now we find out that Biden was communicating with Hunter about [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=504.4s)]
*  Reesma using a pseudonym account, basically a burner account under the name Robert Peters. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=509.28s)]
*  Allegedly. Okay, but this is what the Comer investigations turned up. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=514.48s)]
*  It's certainly not looking good. And as you said, this is all partisan investigations. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=518.64s)]
*  So my point is people who live in glass houses shouldn't be investigating glass houses. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=520.88s)]
*  Here's the thing, like if you're going to evaluate, and listen, obviously I'm biased, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=524.16s)]
*  but if you're going to investigate Tesla over this, like people can buy and trade the stock [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=529.76s)]
*  however they want. Like there seems to be some Biden administration, you know, like jihad against [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=536.4s)]
*  Elon, they're going after him for this. And totally. Well, no, remember a week or two ago, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=542.08s)]
*  they wouldn't find him to the EV summit. I mean, it's all, I think that's where the whole thing [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=546.64s)]
*  started is that they wouldn't invite him to the EV summit because they're not a union shop. And then [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=550.4s)]
*  Elon spoke out about that. Remember Biden introduced the CEO of GM, giving her credit [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=555.52s)]
*  for launching the whole EV revolution. So Elon criticized the administration for that. But I [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  think the main reason why they don't like him is because what he's done with free speech on Twitter. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=565.52s)]
*  Twitter. Yeah. This glass house investigation is the second one. The one that happened last week [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=569.44s)]
*  is they're investigating SpaceX for supposedly screening out foreign nationals in the hiring [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=574.96s)]
*  process. They are saying, wait a second, the DOJ is alleging that SpaceX was hiring too many [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=580.48s)]
*  Americans and they needed to hire more refugees. My head spinning. Even though, even though there's a [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=587.04s)]
*  lot of, not refugees, no refugees, refugees, a refugee is somebody fleeing a country. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=593.6s)]
*  Nick, because of my political persecution. What, where did the term refugees come from? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=601.04s)]
*  No, it is a term. A refugee is somebody fleeing a country because of political persecution. Why [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=606.4s)]
*  would they use that term? The DOJ sued SpaceX basically for DEI foot faults. They said that [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=612.72s)]
*  there was not enough refugees and asylum seekers that were being adequately considered and being [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=618.72s)]
*  hired by SpaceX. The problem with that, as it turns out, is that the DOJ is not even allowed to hire [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=624.08s)]
*  asylum seekers and refugees. No, no. SpaceX is governed under the same laws because it's a rocket [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=631.28s)]
*  company as advanced weapons contractors. Of course. And the whole industry has been under the belief [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=638.0799999999999s)]
*  for many years that they could only hire American citizens and green card holders for these very [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=644.0799999999999s)]
*  sensitive jobs. Of course. And what happened is earlier in the year, the Biden administration [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=650.72s)]
*  released what they called a clarification. Here, I'll post this. Nick, can you pull this up? So the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=657.28s)]
*  U.S. DOJ Civil Rights Division released this, again, what they called a clarification, how to [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=661.36s)]
*  avoid immigration related discrimination when complying with U.S. export control laws. The [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=666.9599999999999s)]
*  export control laws is what governs rocket companies and weapons contractors. It's basically the [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=671.68s)]
*  companies that are involved in these sensitive national security areas. Until now, the government [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=677.76s)]
*  was pretty clear that you were only supposed to hire U.S. citizens and green card holders. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=683.36s)]
*  What's the motivation here, Sax? Explain to me the motivation. It's crazy because they have this crazy idea [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=689.2s)]
*  that these companies, these national security companies, should be hiring more refugees and [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=694.64s)]
*  asylum seekers. Wait, wait. Even though this is the definition of a national security risk. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=700.88s)]
*  But the really crazy thing, so first of all, I think this update that they issued, this is lawmaking, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=705.92s)]
*  okay, they called it a clarification, but this is a Biden administration making new law through [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=710.64s)]
*  I think this is a crazy law. It's really the opposite of what we should want, which is [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=718.16s)]
*  more Americans getting jobs. Sax, can I ask you a question? But what they've done with this lawsuit [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=722.4s)]
*  is they're going back and remember, the key here is that that was only issued in April of this year. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=726.4s)]
*  They've gone back and said that from 2008 to 2022, SpaceX is governed by this new understanding. So [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=730.96s)]
*  they're basically making it retroactive. Okay, putting aside this legalese here for a second, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=737.92s)]
*  I just want to talk first principles. If you were a foreign government, and you wanted to infiltrate [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=742.56s)]
*  some company like SpaceX or Andro or whatever, would it not be easier to send a quote unquote [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=748.8s)]
*  refugee to America, especially to get in versus flipping an American who already works there? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=755.68s)]
*  It should be a much easier process. Especially because it makes no sense. Right, because [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=761.5999999999999s)]
*  especially since all you have to do is go to the hole in the wall in Yuma, Arizona, as RFK Jr. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=766.08s)]
*  showed, and you just mentioned the word asylum, like the cartel has taught you to. And all of a [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=771.6800000000001s)]
*  sudden, you're a refugee, you're in, they give you a piece of paper that tells you're going to be in [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=776.96s)]
*  court in three years, but you're in thousands of people, tens of thousands of people have done this. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=780.72s)]
*  Also, another pragmatic question, Freberg, how many people who are coming in as asylum seekers [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=785.36s)]
*  have the advanced degrees or background to work at Andro SpaceX, I don't know, pick an aerospace [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=789.92s)]
*  weapons based company? Like, what percentage of refugees do you think coming across the southern [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=797.5999999999999s)]
*  border or whatever border they're coming in would actually have those qualifications? So anyway, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=802.24s)]
*  this seems insane. Well, and so Jacob, you raise an interesting point, because I think one of the [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=805.8399999999999s)]
*  really unusual things about this DOJ lawsuit against SpaceX is that the remedies are seeking [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=809.92s)]
*  or unprecedented. What they've said is anybody who was screened out as part of this process [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=816.88s)]
*  was entitled to back pay lost wages since they were screened out. So in other words, it assumes [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=823.4399999999999s)]
*  that every single one of those people would have been hired. They probably hire one out of a thousand [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=829.6s)]
*  or one out of a hundred applicants gets hired. And if they could have gotten a job at SpaceX, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=834.64s)]
*  as we all know, their bar for hiring is incredibly high. They probably didn't have damages because [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=838.88s)]
*  they could probably get jobs at 10 other companies as well. Oh, my God, the Biden [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=843.04s)]
*  administration is just like self inflicted wounds here. This is so dumb. What a stupid [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=846.88s)]
*  approach is the glass house thing a misallocation of funds claim? Like it's a securities issue. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=851.92s)]
*  Is that what it is? It's a securities issue that it was improperly disclosed and that they may not [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=857.1999999999999s)]
*  have filed the proper taxes because it would have been a paid benefit to Elon. Right. Right. But I [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=862.9599999999999s)]
*  mean, don't you feel like this is a stretch? I mean, they are stretching every law they can to [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=868.0s)]
*  go after this guy. It's getting to be a little bit Trump. I hate to bring it up. Let's be clear. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=872.8s)]
*  Here's what's happening. I think that when Elon bought Twitter, what effectively happened is the [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=876.88s)]
*  biggest PSY ops organization for the Democratic Party was taken away from them. And I think that [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=883.92s)]
*  they are increasingly feeling like if it really does, if Twitter or X becomes a town square, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=890.56s)]
*  that's really bad for them. And so they can't shape people. They can't amplify the victimization. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=896.96s)]
*  They can't amplify the government's going to save you narratives. And so this is the sort of death [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=903.44s)]
*  by a thousand cuts approach that the blob has of trying to bring him down. And so you see a DOJ [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=910.72s)]
*  lawsuit over here. It's nominal, but whatever. Then you're going to see the SEC investigation [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=919.36s)]
*  over $50,000 of glass. I mean, the guy is worth a quarter of a trillion dollars and we're sweating [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=926.24s)]
*  the $50,000 glass purchase. But the point is, the goal is to tie him up and to distract him [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=932.64s)]
*  and to basically take resources away his mind share from working. Now we all know him. So he's [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=940.48s)]
*  going to do the exact opposite. That's not going to work. Not going to work. Alex Spiro is going to have a job for the rest of his life. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=946.96s)]
*  That's his lawyer from Quinn Emanuel. And Alex is going to beat these things back. And generally, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=952.24s)]
*  Alex will win most lawsuits. I say most, but not all. But anyways, the point is that the point is that [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=957.52s)]
*  I think you're exactly right about what's motivating this and what's going on. But I'll tell you when it [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=971.36s)]
*  all began is that Biden had a press conference where he said that Elon needed to be looked at. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=976.0799999999999s)]
*  Do you remember this? Yeah, yeah. Biden said, well, I don't know that Elon's done anything wrong, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=981.52s)]
*  but I think we need to look at his relationships with other countries. So this was the signal [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=986.8s)]
*  to all of the ambitious apparatchiks in our law enforcement agencies who are looking for advancement [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=992.0799999999999s)]
*  that he's the target. Go after him. Find something. Now, in fact, they couldn't find anything. So [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1000.96s)]
*  they look at his relationship with other countries. And what you would expect [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1007.68s)]
*  is that maybe he hired some foreign nationals he shouldn't have. But it was the exact opposite. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1011.2s)]
*  They didn't hire foreign nationals. So then they make that the crime. It reminds me of the whole [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1016.72s)]
*  Alvin Bragg thing where Alvin Bragg made that case that Trump was required by campaign finance laws [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1022.48s)]
*  to pay Stormy Daniels using donor money. But you know, you know that if they had found that Trump [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1029.92s)]
*  paid Stormy Daniels with donations, they would have charged him with that. It's like investigating [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1037.92s)]
*  the guy, finding he did nothing wrong, and then charging him with the opposite of what you would [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1043.04s)]
*  expect. No equivalency between these and Trump's behavior, but sure. It's the weaponization of the [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1046.8000000000002s)]
*  justice system. It's show me the man and I'll show you the crime. Now, incorrect with the last two. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1051.28s)]
*  I mean, he committed a lot of crimes, but we'll leave that off the docket for now. We're going [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1056.3200000000002s)]
*  to agree to disagree on that one. Okay, just very interesting media related story and find [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1059.68s)]
*  you're giving Robert Peters too much credit. I mean, Joe Biden. I'm listen. Biden's got to go. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1066.72s)]
*  Trump's got to go. We need a new platform. I have announced that I am supporting Nikki Haley and [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1074.24s)]
*  Chris Christie slash Vivek Vivek. That would be my ideal ticket right now. I want the only person [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1080.24s)]
*  freeburg who brought up spending in either party. Nikki, let's just agree. I'll move on. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1086.0s)]
*  But I just want to also say we were wondering who won the debate last week. Biggest increase Nikki [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1094.64s)]
*  Halley. So apparently, what's it look like? I think she went from two to nine, seven to nine [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1099.52s)]
*  in different in different polls. So it's somewhere between she tripled. I think you went I think [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1106.8s)]
*  you're right. She went to nine to seven. There was one two to seven one two to nine. But anyway, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1113.84s)]
*  putting it aside, the people are actually promoting it because they want Trump to be up against a [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1118.32s)]
*  bunch. They want to be up against a bunch of against one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Three people at [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1123.4399999999998s)]
*  10 to 15% is better than one at 30. I think that's probably correct. Can I just ask because I haven't [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1129.28s)]
*  followed it this week. What was the set like after it's settled after the bounces in the spikes, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1134.32s)]
*  saxipoo? What? Where where are we at now in the Republican race after this past week and having [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1140.48s)]
*  people having a chance to really figure out what happens in the debate? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I think [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1146.48s)]
*  the consensus view just about is that the biggest beneficiary of the debate was Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1150.4s)]
*  By far. Yes, Nikki Haley did get a little bit of a bounce, but Vivek got a much bigger one. He's [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1156.16s)]
*  much better known to the base now. And I think that it's Vivek and DeSantis are now more or less [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1160.8s)]
*  neck and neck for number two. Haley might be number three at this point, but I think it helped [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1168.72s)]
*  Vivek the most. Now, it's also true that he got a lot of criticism, but I think that's kind of where [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1174.32s)]
*  he wants to be. I mean, you want to be the center of attention and the people who are attacking him [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1181.52s)]
*  now are all these neocons. It's basically the whole military industrial complex. It's all the [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1186.72s)]
*  paid for politicians and think tanks who, you know, want America to be in these forever wars. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1192.1599999999999s)]
*  So I think he's being attacked by the right people and that's going to help him. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1198.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So, Sachs, you see him like basically, it's going to be Trump versus Vivek if this continues. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1201.6s)]
*  Well, it's hard to say. I mean, I think DeSantis is still in the mix. I think it's noteworthy that [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1210.3999999999999s)]
*  the top three candidates all have expressed significant either misgivings or opposition [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1215.92s)]
*  to our involvement in Ukraine. Trump, Vivek and DeSantis with varying degrees [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1223.04s)]
*  of strength have basically all opposed Biden's policy and they are the leading candidates in [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1229.8400000000001s)]
*  their public and primary. I think that's telling you something very important. Haley, Christie, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1234.0800000000002s)]
*  Pence, Tim Scott, they all would like to do even more in Ukraine and that is not where the party is. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1240.4s)]
*  So it's not where the country is. Nobody's there. One other piece of debate fallout that I thought [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1246.64s)]
*  was really interesting was that they interviewed Oliver Anthony. You remember the guy who sings [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1251.68s)]
*  that song, the rich man, North of Richmond, because Fox News made the first question about his song. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1257.1200000000001s)]
*  And he clarified what the song was about. What he said is the Richmond he's talking about, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1264.5600000000002s)]
*  North of Richmond, are the people in D.C. It's the blob. It was the people on the debate stage. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1268.8s)]
*  Well, but what he said specifically was it was the people who got us into all these endless wars [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1274.3999999999999s)]
*  when I was growing up. It was the Republicans who did specifically. He was talking about [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1280.6399999999999s)]
*  Bush, Cheney Republicans, neocons. He made that explicit and clear. I'm singing more about like [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1285.68s)]
*  a lot of the older super conservative politicians that brought us into endless war through my [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1292.8s)]
*  entire childhood. Those are Bush era neocons. He said the people on that stage is who I'm talking [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1298.32s)]
*  about. Don't use my song. This song is not a left or a right song. It's about the people. It was a [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1304.1599999999999s)]
*  song about his contemporaries is what he said. Not and he's talking about both parties. And he [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1308.96s)]
*  said specifically, if the people on that stage I'm talking about, don't use my song again. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1313.6s)]
*  OK, let's go on to the next story. There was a leaked document and we had this come up last week. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1316.8799999999999s)]
*  The leaked document was sent to Chamath and it was about Tiger Global's struggles. It had a line [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1322.24s)]
*  at the top that said this was a spiked or a draft of a New Yorker story. I think the draft is the [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1329.68s)]
*  way they said it. And we had a little conversation about here. We decided not to publish it. We had a [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1334.88s)]
*  little discussion because we did not think in our private discussion that this was a real story. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1341.52s)]
*  I saw grammatical errors in it. SAC said we really can't publish something like this because [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1348.4s)]
*  it's slanderous and we don't know the provenance of it. And on Friday, Tiger sent a letter to its [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1353.6000000000001s)]
*  LPs in response to the document. They wrote that they are being targeted, quote, targeted with a [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1359.76s)]
*  series of misinformation attacks anonymously using a cryptic messaging platforms like Signal. We [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1364.88s)]
*  strongly believe these were written by a disgruntled form employee with whom we parted ways, unlike the [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1369.2800000000002s)]
*  anonymous coward spreading this false narrative on the internet. You know who we are and we are [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1375.92s)]
*  here and ready to answer your questions. Rest assured our team remains highly focused on our [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1380.5600000000002s)]
*  core business, which has been performing this year. So Chamath, just your broad thoughts on [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1384.72s)]
*  the Tiger Global non-story, a fake faux story by a former employee. Chase is an incredible person. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1391.1200000000001s)]
*  I've said this before. He helped me get into the business of investing. He seeded my first angel [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1399.04s)]
*  fund. I was pretty helpful, I think, in getting them on the cap table at Facebook [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1404.64s)]
*  many, many years ago, which helped them get going as well. So I think that he's a wonderful human [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1412.96s)]
*  being and I've had nothing but positive things to say about him. Scotch Lifer, I don't know as well, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1418.3200000000002s)]
*  but he seems like clearly a hard charging person that's achieved quite a lot. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1424.3200000000002s)]
*  And so I'm glad that we didn't publish it or talk about it. And if there is something to [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1428.96s)]
*  be said, the story will be validated and people will get to the bottom of it. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1434.56s)]
*  What is crazy is I don't understand what this document actually serves, except exactly as you [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1440.08s)]
*  said to a disgruntled person who has absolutely no economics. Meaning, if you're an LP, you don't [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1448.1599999999999s)]
*  want this document to be out. If you're a partner that has carry, you don't want this out into the [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1454.48s)]
*  out in the wild either. If you're a portfolio company, you don't want this document out in the [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1462.0s)]
*  wild. So I tend to believe that this is just a disgruntled person. Again, look, I've had this [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1466.64s)]
*  experience as well. So which is that there are all kinds of employees who work with you. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1472.8s)]
*  We try our best as leaders of organizations to compensate them well. But invariably, what I find [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1479.52s)]
*  are people overestimate their contributions. And people try to take way more credit. They try to [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1485.76s)]
*  take credit for deals that they've done that they didn't actually do. They try to take credit for [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1492.96s)]
*  all the internal workings. And then invariably, when the leadership decides that those folks [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1498.8799999999999s)]
*  aren't a good fit anymore, mostly for cultural reasons, and are exited, they have a bone to pick [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1506.08s)]
*  and an axe to grind. And they try to sort of distribute misinformation to other LPs to other [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1512.4s)]
*  GPs to portfolio company CEOs. It's happened to me. It's happened to chase. It's happened [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1520.3200000000002s)]
*  to Sequoia. It's happened to any of us that have been successful. So grind people. Yeah. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1527.1200000000001s)]
*  Again, it's just another example of like, there are the people that are in the arena doing and [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1532.72s)]
*  then there are the people that kind of get kicked out and get really upset and [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1537.36s)]
*  lose track of what's important. These people, instead of writing these missives, should be [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1542.8799999999999s)]
*  working. Yeah. I mean, how, how to scramble sacks does a former employee need to be to put in this [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1548.32s)]
*  kind of effort to write a 10 page faux New Yorker style expose. And you were the voice of reason, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1555.84s)]
*  I think, in our group chat and just saying like, I don't even think we should talk about it in a [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1562.9599999999998s)]
*  meta kind of way. We weren't going to cover the details of it, but even a meta discussion of it, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1566.56s)]
*  you put the kibosh on, which we would have been first, like kind of highlighting this craziness, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1570.24s)]
*  but you took a pretty hard stance. Your thoughts on it? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1575.04s)]
*  Well, it was written like it was some sort of journalistic article, but a journalistic article [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1578.96s)]
*  has a byline. You know who wrote it, you know, who publishes it, it has provenance, you know, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1584.24s)]
*  therefore who is liable if it's slanderous. Yeah. This piece that was going around had [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1589.6s)]
*  none of those things. And therefore my view was that we shouldn't discuss it. And my view is we [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1596.08s)]
*  shouldn't even mention it because all you're then doing is drawing attention to something that, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1601.36s)]
*  again, you don't know the providence of, and you don't know whether it's true or not, and you don't [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1606.1599999999999s)]
*  know who's standing by it. Now what's happened in the last week is that Tiger has issued a statement [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1609.12s)]
*  about it and that statement was covered by the press. So I guess we can talk about the fact that [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1614.48s)]
*  they've had to respond to this. I'm still not comfortable talking about any of the contents of [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1619.36s)]
*  it because again, nobody's put their name by it. So why even put them in the position of needing [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1623.28s)]
*  to respond to it until somebody is willing to basically raise their hand and say, this is what [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1628.8s)]
*  I think. The piece that was circulated was a mix of both business criticism or business issues and [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1634.0s)]
*  slander, personal slander. So, I mean, are there business issues in there that we could discuss? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1640.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, then they would be interesting, but until we know that there's some authenticity to it, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1646.32s)]
*  I don't feel comfortable giving any attention whatsoever to this thing. Personally, I think [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1652.08s)]
*  even talking about it now is still kind of a waste of time. Freiburg, any thoughts on it, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1656.08s)]
*  just as we wrap here? No, it's clearly a disgruntled person trying to [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1659.9199999999998s)]
*  cast a negative light on the firm. Just get a job, bro. All right. De-dollarization corner. Bricks [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1668.0s)]
*  added six new members climbing to 11 total. And Bricks, of course, everybody knows, Brazil, Russia, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1673.04s)]
*  India, China and South Africa. These four countries make up 40% of the world's population, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1680.16s)]
*  25% of global GDP. Joining the Bricks block are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ethiopia, Egypt, Argentina, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1685.6000000000001s)]
*  and the UAE. New Bricks, and it's kind of being set up as like an alternative to G7, G8, I guess. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1693.76s)]
*  New Bricks makes up almost 50% of the global population with a third of GDP. This is the first [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1700.96s)]
*  expansion in 13 years since South Africa joined SAX. You've got some thoughts on the Bricks and a [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1708.16s)]
*  little presentation here. Inform the audience. All right. So, Jake, like you said, they added [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1712.88s)]
*  six new members, Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and UAE. This is on top of the [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1717.28s)]
*  original five members. Now, you've described this group of countries as mid. I don't know what [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1722.72s)]
*  metric you're using to make that determination. If you look at share of global GDP in purchasing [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1730.32s)]
*  power parity terms, and we can debate whether that's the right method or not, but a lot of [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1738.3999999999999s)]
*  economists believe that PPP is the right way to look at it. The original Bricks were 32% of global [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1742.72s)]
*  GDP. The new Bricks bring it to 37%. And there's a couple dozen more countries that have expressed [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1748.8799999999999s)]
*  an interest in joining Bricks, which would bring it to 45%. The G7 is only 30%. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1754.64s)]
*  And that number has been declining over time. Back in 1995, it was all the way at 45%, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1761.3600000000001s)]
*  whereas the Bricks were only about 17%. You can see that decline or shift here in this chart, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1766.96s)]
*  going all the way back to the 1980s. This is why I think a lot of Americans have this [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1773.2800000000002s)]
*  casually dismissive attitude towards the Bricks, is they're thinking that these countries are still [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1777.2800000000002s)]
*  living in the era of the 1990s of unipolarity when the G7 was more than half of global GDP. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1782.8s)]
*  But now the Bricks are bigger than the G7. Again, in terms of PPP, the rest have risen [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1792.96s)]
*  and has become a very substantial part of the world economy. If you look at global oil production, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1800.24s)]
*  the new Bricks now have 54% of global oil production. It's almost double what the G7 [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1805.28s)]
*  produces despite the US still being the number one producer of oil. We're not the biggest [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1810.64s)]
*  exporter because we use it all. Just to add to that point, oil is of course a declining commodity [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1815.68s)]
*  with renewables and nuclear and people are going to rely on it less. So sure. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1822.5600000000002s)]
*  I don't think renewables are anywhere close to being able to replace fossil fuels. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1827.2s)]
*  Oh, it's cheaper. It's actually cheaper. Hold on. Let me just answer to that. It's cheaper now, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1832.0s)]
*  and Chamath can speak to this, to install solar wind than it is to do a lot of the [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1838.56s)]
*  carbon-based fuels. So it actually has tipped economically where it's I think cheaper in 80% [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1844.6399999999999s)]
*  of cases, 85% of cases to install renewables. Is that correct, Chamath? Probably speaking. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1850.3999999999999s)]
*  The cost of solar is effectively now the cheapest form of energy on a kilowatt per hour basis. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1855.2s)]
*  Great. Okay. Continue, Sam. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1861.76s)]
*  Well, this isn't preventing Germany from sliding into a massive recession because they're not able [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1863.36s)]
*  to get cheap energy anymore. Yeah, they turned off their nuclear. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1867.36s)]
*  That also supposes that you have the actual supply. And to David's point, why Germany has [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1871.12s)]
*  such a difficult issue is because they turned off Nat Gas, they turned off the reactors, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1876.3999999999999s)]
*  and there's just not enough solar installed right now. So you also think about- [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1880.32s)]
*  It's also a cloudy country. What I just meant was more the levelized cost of energy, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1884.24s)]
*  which is if you had an installation here and an installation there of two different modes of energy [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1888.24s)]
*  generation, solar is cheaper. But David is right. It's still going to take some time for [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1892.96s)]
*  the proliferation of solar. Agreed. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1897.76s)]
*  So that- Yeah, we all agree. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1899.3600000000001s)]
*  The US is already roughly energy independent. We produce about 20 million barrels of oil a day. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1901.1200000000001s)]
*  We consume about 20 million. So we are roughly neutral with respect to the world. We're neither [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1907.28s)]
*  a net importer or net exporter as of now. So oil is still going to be a huge- It's the number one [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1913.68s)]
*  global commodity. If BRICS adds Venezuela, Algeria, and Kazakhstan, as they may do [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1920.5600000000002s)]
*  as soon as next year, they'll control 90% of all oil and gas traded globally. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1926.64s)]
*  You're going to have an OPEC plus BRICS sort of symbiosis because Russia and Saudi Arabia [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1931.3600000000001s)]
*  basically run OPEC plus. New BRICS is also really strong in food production. Five of the world's [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1937.6000000000001s)]
*  six biggest food producers are now part of BRICS, China, Brazil, India, Argentina, Russia. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1941.92s)]
*  The only other one is the US. They have 46% of global population, 36% of global landmass. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1947.68s)]
*  So my point is BRICS isn't just strong in global GDP. They're strong in the production of what are [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1954.24s)]
*  currently the two most important commodities in the world, which is oil and food. They also have [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1961.68s)]
*  influence over strategic trade routes. So if you look at where these countries are located, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1967.68s)]
*  and I'm sure this went into the thinking of who they just admitted to BRICS because they had a lot [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1972.24s)]
*  of choices, they had something like 26 countries applied, and these are the first six they've added. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1976.88s)]
*  So they now control the Arctic sea route, which is basically as the polar ice cap starts to melt [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1982.48s)]
*  in the Arctic, you're seeing a new ability to create maritime routes north of Russia, basically, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1989.1200000000001s)]
*  from Europe to Asia. It's a much faster route than going around the Horn of Africa or through the [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=1995.7600000000002s)]
*  Suez Canal. You have this international north-south transportation corridor, which is basically a [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2000.16s)]
*  combination of overland routes and some maritime that connect Russia, Iran, and India. You've got [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2006.08s)]
*  Belt and Road, these east-west corridors. You've got the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and the Suez [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2012.8799999999999s)]
*  Canal. They're all now part of BRICS. And the point of that, I think, strategically is to bypass [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2017.52s)]
*  choke points like the Strait of Singapore, the Strait of Malacca, the Bosphorus, and the Strait [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2024.32s)]
*  of Hormuz. So the point here is that the US Navy has very strategically over decades been encircling [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2028.8799999999999s)]
*  China with military bases on island chains around China. This is going to basically neutralize that [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2035.8400000000001s)]
*  whole strategy because China will have ways of securing its trade routes over land or, again, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2043.8400000000001s)]
*  over sea going through the Arctic. So this has huge geostrategic implications. The other big thing [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2051.2s)]
*  that I think BRICS is doing is they have this five to 10-year goal of allowing BRICS members to [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2057.68s)]
*  settle trades in local currencies. I think that you guys may be seeing it the wrong way. The goal [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2061.52s)]
*  here is not to create a new reserve currency. It's simply to create a way to bypass the dollar [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2067.04s)]
*  complex. They're trying to break the petrodollar monopoly. This is not an offensive organization, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2072.32s)]
*  and they're not necessarily trying to create a single alternative to the US dollar. They are [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2077.44s)]
*  trying to create a way to not have to go through the dollar complex in order to do their trade when [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2084.08s)]
*  they're trading with each other. What China and Brazil are doing is a test case for this, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2090.08s)]
*  where they are setting up a Yuan clearing arrangement with Brazil. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2096.88s)]
*  The goal, to be clear, Sacks here, is to have a voice versus the G7, which they feel a lot [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2102.0s)]
*  of these countries feel they've been left out of, and to maybe not have as much dependency on the [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2107.04s)]
*  West and form this block that has a bigger voice in the world. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2112.4s)]
*  I'll go a little further and say this isn't just about them having a voice. It's about [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2120.88s)]
*  them having economic sovereignty. They do not want to be completely dependent on the United States to [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2125.52s)]
*  secure their economies. The big driver of this has been the weaponization of the US dollar. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2131.2000000000003s)]
*  Swift, yeah. What we did to Russia with Swift, yes. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2138.08s)]
*  In conjunction with this Ukraine war, the US sees Russia's foreign reserves, which were in dollars. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2141.04s)]
*  They've widely imposed sanctions. We're now sanctioning dozens and dozens of countries, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2146.8s)]
*  and we are technically limiting who can use Swift as part of this. If you are any of the [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2151.44s)]
*  BRICS countries, you're asking yourself, wait a second, when I am doing business with [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2157.92s)]
*  another member of BRICS, why should the US be any part of that transaction? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2162.96s)]
*  Yeah, they do not want that transaction to be mediated by the US at all. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2167.52s)]
*  In a way, it's like people buying crypto so that they don't have to deal with the US government. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2171.52s)]
*  They have Bitcoin over here, and they're not subject to the rules of the US dollar. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2175.92s)]
*  It's like a way of having some independence. Yeah, I totally get it. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2181.52s)]
*  They're willing to play by the US's rules when they're trading with the US, but they do not want [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2185.76s)]
*  to have to play by the US's rules when they're not trading with the US or the G7. This is about [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2190.88s)]
*  creating that independence. I think it's great that they have, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2195.7599999999998s)]
*  Chamath, that there is a competitor to the US dollar because it makes us be more thoughtful [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2198.3199999999997s)]
*  about our spending ultimately and our balance sheet. What are your thoughts on all this, Chamath? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2202.16s)]
*  I have a couple. If you go back to when the BRICS was created, this is like 20 plus years ago, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2205.92s)]
*  it was first just BRICS and with a small S. That was 2001, yeah. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2213.2s)]
*  And then it became BRICS with a big S when they admitted South Africa. I think the [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2217.3599999999997s)]
*  fact pattern in that organization is pretty poor. When they first got organized, they tried to [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2221.3599999999997s)]
*  create a competitor to the IMF. I think it's called IDB, the International Development Bank. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2227.44s)]
*  That bank has not disbursed a single dollar in 23 years. They tried to create a joint program [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2234.64s)]
*  to lay undersea fiber amongst these countries, hasn't even started. I think it's good that this [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2241.76s)]
*  organization is growing. I think the problem is that the actual amount of legislative coordination [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2248.4s)]
*  that these countries has been able to exhibit has been literally zero. The problem now is that their [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2256.2400000000002s)]
*  regional rivalries are only growing. China and India, which are the two anchor partners of BRICS, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2263.76s)]
*  are literally in a land war. There is a border that they fight over with guns. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2268.64s)]
*  You have a growing anti-Chinese resentment inside of both India and Brazil. Nick, you can just throw [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2275.92s)]
*  up this little chart. In India, they've blocked a lot of apps. They're about to block a bunch of [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2282.24s)]
*  imports, but India sees China as an existential threat. The Brazilian population, this is just a [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2286.64s)]
*  poll that the economist put in. There's just a lot of anti-Chinese sentiment. It's very hard to see [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2294.32s)]
*  folks that are such polar enemies actually working together, even if they're part of [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2303.36s)]
*  an organization. I think that the odds of legislative coordination in the future [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2307.36s)]
*  are probably less than what they were even 10 years ago. I expect even less, and it's hard [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2313.36s)]
*  to expect even less when nothing has been done. Then the second is I just look at the data. If [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2318.32s)]
*  you look at SWIFT in July, the SWIFT volumes on US dollars was the largest ever. It's one of these [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2323.36s)]
*  weird things where I think that it's good that that organization exists. Don't get me wrong, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2332.48s)]
*  because I do think that if they could... Oh, the other thing that I'll say about the BRICS, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2337.28s)]
*  which is odd, is that unlike the G7 and unlike NATO, where you have democratic ideals that [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2341.6800000000003s)]
*  underpin the organizational framework, here it doesn't because you have China, Russia, Iran, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2348.08s)]
*  which are total polar opposites to Brazil and India in terms of democratic governance. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2355.2s)]
*  I don't know enough about Ethiopia or Egypt to say anything. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2361.04s)]
*  They're challenged states at a minimum. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2365.7599999999998s)]
*  No, no, no. I'm just saying they're not democratic. NATO and the G7 are all [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2369.68s)]
*  democratically elected countries. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2374.3199999999997s)]
*  It's a very good point. They don't share the same operating system. The authoritarians and [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2376.16s)]
*  democratic nations put together. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2379.7599999999998s)]
*  So then the last thing is could you see a currency framework to compete against the US dollar? I [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2381.2799999999997s)]
*  think the practical complexity is if you take all of these other issues, land wars, import controls, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2387.9199999999996s)]
*  and growing Chinese resentment, and now try to boil that into an exchange rate mechanism [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2393.52s)]
*  where the renminbi and the rupee and the rei can be interchangeable. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2398.88s)]
*  I think it's very difficult to see because if you look at the last time that that happened, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2407.6800000000003s)]
*  the franc, the lira, the pound, sterling, the deutschmark, that was possible because all of [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2411.36s)]
*  those other factors were not on the table. They were not fighting with each other. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2417.12s)]
*  There wasn't this anti-resentment in one country to another country. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2420.88s)]
*  They roughly held the same democratic ideals. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2424.4s)]
*  I think my comment is I think it's good that BRICS is growing. I think that if they can get [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2427.44s)]
*  some legislative or policy coordination wins, it'll be great. The track record is literally zero. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2431.84s)]
*  The setup doesn't to me mean much yet, but hopefully that something happens. Who knows? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2439.84s)]
*  Friedberg or Doss? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2445.52s)]
*  I think the arguments about the pragmatism of non-dollar denominated trade and the progress [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2446.64s)]
*  that's been realized or can be projected to be realized from current policy can be debated. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2455.76s)]
*  What I think is most important is the signal that's being given, which is that there is [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2462.7200000000003s)]
*  a desire by a larger percentage of global GDP than is represented by the G7 to de-dollarize. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2470.0800000000004s)]
*  While these intentions may be difficult to translate into policy in the near term, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2479.28s)]
*  that signal says a lot about the influence and perhaps the policy of the US in addressing and [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2485.28s)]
*  dealing with a lot of these countries and global economic actors. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2495.04s)]
*  But I don't think they want to de-dollarize. That's not part of their... [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2498.56s)]
*  They want to increase trade as a stated mission and they want to collaborate on trade. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2501.6000000000004s)]
*  But Friedberg, do you think the stated mission is de-dollarization or do you think the implicit [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2507.76s)]
*  outcome is de-dollarization? [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2513.44s)]
*  No, the local currency support initiatives are implicit de-dollarization. I don't hear anyone [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2515.36s)]
*  saying we got to destroy the dollar because they're all very important trade partners. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2520.8s)]
*  Most of those countries are very important trade partners with the US and very dependent on [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2524.48s)]
*  trade with the US. It seems less that it's about, hey, we've got to hurt the US and it's more about [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2529.76s)]
*  we have to be independent from the US. We have to be independent. Implicit in that is independent [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2535.04s)]
*  from the US. I think that that tone, that signal says a lot about US economic policy and US foreign [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2540.24s)]
*  policy that there's something off with the unipolarity as Sax has pointed out that it's [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2547.52s)]
*  not de facto anymore, that there is intention here for there to be something different. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2554.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, that's very healthy. That's very, very healthy. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2560.16s)]
*  I think that that opens up avenues and paths that we're not thinking about today. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2562.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2565.8399999999997s)]
*  All of a sudden we'll wake up and we'll be like, whoops, and we need to be thoughtful about that. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2566.56s)]
*  I think that's the most powerful part of Sax's commentary is that it's a very firm establishment [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2570.32s)]
*  even of the non-unipolarity of the world. But the thing that the BRICS have to do is, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2577.84s)]
*  I would just encourage them, book a quick win. There has to be some policy coordination that [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2584.8s)]
*  they could do to prove that there's something there that's more than just a get together once [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2591.2s)]
*  a year. And that's been missing for 22 years so far. And that would have a really important, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2597.3599999999997s)]
*  I think, effect. Yeah, I agree with you, David. I think that's the litmus test. That hasn't happened [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2605.4399999999996s)]
*  yet. Let me partially agree with that and then [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2609.3599999999997s)]
*  partially respond to what you were saying before, Chamath. So it's true that BRICS does not have an [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2611.8399999999997s)]
*  impressive record of accomplishment to date. That's simply true. However, recent events, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2616.48s)]
*  I think, have provided the motivation for this group of countries to now try and get something [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2624.0s)]
*  done. In the past, it was just so phenomenally convenient to be based on the US dollar complex [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2629.12s)]
*  because everything's priced in dollars, easy to transact in dollars. And when you run a trade [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2636.4s)]
*  surplus, the US has an open capital account and you can just park the money in US treasuries. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2640.56s)]
*  So there was never a reason for any of these countries to want to leave the US dollar complex [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2645.28s)]
*  until more recently, when again, US foreign policy has militarized and weaponized the dollar and to [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2650.4s)]
*  try and make it a coercive instrument to get these countries to do what the US wants. And all those [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2657.52s)]
*  countries now are bristling at that and they want to maintain their sovereignty. And so now they have [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2663.1200000000003s)]
*  tremendous motivation to get this done. Now, the thing they've already agreed to and done as part [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2669.1200000000003s)]
*  of BRICS is that when you join BRICS, you agree not to sanction any other member of BRICS. That is [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2674.64s)]
*  a meaningful commitment. And obviously, it has a lot to do with this Ukraine war and the fact that [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2681.2799999999997s)]
*  US has been demanding that the whole world sanction Russia and most of the world has not been sanctioning [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2687.6s)]
*  Russia. And that's why the sanctions have not been effective is the US has not been able to get that [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2692.0s)]
*  done. The US will not be able to get it done in the future with respect to at least the countries [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2696.16s)]
*  who are members of BRICS with regard to their trade with each other. And as we saw in the percentage [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2702.32s)]
*  of world GDP, BRICS very rapidly once they add a few more members, they're going to be at about 50% [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2707.44s)]
*  or world GDP. So the US is only going to be able to influence, call it roughly that half, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2712.6400000000003s)]
*  a global GDP where the US or the G7 is a major trading partner. Now, what BRICS will be lacking [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2718.0s)]
*  is the way on a technical level to bring about the sovereignty they want. So they need to have [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2724.48s)]
*  a way to settle on clear transactions. And they need to have a place to park the surplus that's [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2732.7200000000003s)]
*  created for net exporters. And they haven't quite figured that out yet. So for example, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2737.84s)]
*  there's a recent news item where Russia, which is selling a huge amount of oil to India right now, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2741.76s)]
*  it was saying that they don't want to accumulate more rupees. So they've got to figure out what [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2748.4s)]
*  do we do with all these extra rupees. So there's a lot of pieces to figure out here. And that is why [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2753.04s)]
*  they're saying this is a goal they have over the next five to 10 years. It's not one to two year [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2757.84s)]
*  timeframe. It's five to 10 years, but they should make their own euro if they feel so strongly that [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2762.4s)]
*  they're a great voting block, make a euro and then they could all put into it. And you can see what [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2767.52s)]
*  happens when a bunch of dictators and a long tail of failed states now share a common currency. It's [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2771.52s)]
*  not going to work. These countries are all each other. Yeah. Failed states who share GDP has been [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2777.84s)]
*  going up. These ones are all very troubled states, by the way. Yeah. I'm troubled. GDP has been [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2783.28s)]
*  going up like a rocket, J Cal. That's the whole point. Inflation and democracy, human rights. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2787.76s)]
*  Their goal is not to create a common currency like the euro. China and India and Brazil are [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2794.2400000000002s)]
*  not going to replace yuan and rupees with some sort of new euro like currency. Moreover, they're not [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2801.28s)]
*  trying to create a reserve currency that's going to be a currency for the man on the street. This is [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2808.32s)]
*  about settlement of global trade flows and getting out from under the US dollar complex. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2812.32s)]
*  My point, just to be clear, Freberg is if you were to think of it as a thought experiment, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2817.44s)]
*  these two schmutz point, these are culturally and strategically very different countries. And I [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2821.52s)]
*  think what they have in common is that they haven't been included in the G seven and really [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2827.92s)]
*  America's reaction to this should be to get India out of this and get them into the G seven and make [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2832.0s)]
*  that strategic decision that India is the most important country for us to have strong relationships [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2837.2000000000003s)]
*  with. It's kind of hard to put Saudi Arabia and to put UAE in this because they don't share the [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2841.68s)]
*  democratic principles of the rest of the G seven. But we should be trying to any democracy that's [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2846.72s)]
*  in the bricks. We should be trying to include in the G seven. That's the strategic chessboard [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2851.7599999999998s)]
*  that would make the most sense. And then you would just leave bricks as all authoritarian dictators. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2856.24s)]
*  And they do not work well together. They always wind up doing that Brazil is still nominally a [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2860.9599999999996s)]
*  democracy. No, that's what I'm saying. Like getting Brazil, I just said getting anybody who's a [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2867.12s)]
*  democracy and moving them towards democracy and getting them into the G seven should be our stated [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2871.52s)]
*  goal. That's what the West should do. Lula, who's Brazil's president is one of the most ardent [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2876.24s)]
*  advocates for de dollarization. Here's this quote, every night I asked myself why all countries have [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2881.8399999999997s)]
*  to base their trade on the dollar. Yeah, they don't they can change him. J Cal me this year, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2887.7599999999998s)]
*  I will get rid of that. That's stupid. That's a stupid statement. Nobody's saying that. I just [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2893.8399999999997s)]
*  said the exact opposite. There are people saying that but oh, not me just to be clear, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2898.16s)]
*  my mouth out of the exact opposite of what I just said, I just said include them. My point is, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2903.04s)]
*  my point is this is not a simplistic dichotomy between dictators and democracies. Another way [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2907.2s)]
*  to think about this is by the way, South Africa is a majority on just on a population basis. If [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2913.2799999999997s)]
*  you took India out and you got the major the G seven, it would be majority, overwhelming majority [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2919.52s)]
*  percentage of citizens in the bricks living under authoritarian rule. But India, let me respond to [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2923.36s)]
*  that. And then also Chamath, India is the largest country in the world. Now, I mean, this is the [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2930.4s)]
*  that's the strategic, important piece here in my mind. I think India and the US will pull tighter [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2933.76s)]
*  together in terms of security because of a mutual desire to balance the power of China. So I think [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2938.96s)]
*  Chamath is right about that. However, India also has a very strong anti colonial impetus to their [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2946.32s)]
*  politics and especially their foreign policy. They do not like being told what to do by the West [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2954.72s)]
*  and the United States. And in particular, they do not believe in many of their politicians said this, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2960.8799999999997s)]
*  we don't see why we should have to sacrifice for you. We're going to do what's in the best [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2965.52s)]
*  interest of our own people. And that is why India has rejected enormous pressure from the US not to [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2970.08s)]
*  trade with Russia. India and Russia as bad as the relationship is between India and China is the [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2976.3199999999997s)]
*  relationship between India and Russia is very strong. It historically always has been. And Russia [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2981.84s)]
*  right now is supplying half of India's oil. And India has adamantly refused to play along with the [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2987.44s)]
*  US sanctions. Rightfully so. And rightfully so. Right. They should make their own best decisions. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2994.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Right. So I think a lot of people are thinking that India is not here to be a boot [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=2999.92s)]
*  licker to the United States. Exactly. Exactly. So look, I think India will pursue its interests. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3004.7200000000003s)]
*  I think when it comes to security, they will align with the US to balance the power of China. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3010.56s)]
*  But I think when it comes to economic policy, India will pursue its own interest, which I think [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3014.88s)]
*  has to do with maintaining their economic sovereignty. 100% cheap oil. They need cheap [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3019.44s)]
*  oil. They're developing country, right? They need oil. And that's the lowest priced oil. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3024.16s)]
*  Another way to think about the framing is that the priorities for many of these countries for [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3030.4s)]
*  the last two decades have shifted, going from a state of economic insecurity, civil insecurity, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3035.36s)]
*  government insecurity. And as you obviously establish systems and certainty in certain [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3044.1600000000003s)]
*  elements, the dollar complex of Sachs frames it was very useful in helping them with that transition. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3051.04s)]
*  But as they start to move from emerging market to developing market to developed market, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3059.36s)]
*  the priorities start to shift. And then the priorities become much more about sovereignty, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3065.2000000000003s)]
*  independence, institutional destiny, etc. that kind of start to make this more realistic. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3071.44s)]
*  But maybe they don't have their ducks in a row at this point, but there's certainly a conversation [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3077.04s)]
*  or set of conversations that emerges when you're not worried about civil war, or you're not worried [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3081.2000000000003s)]
*  about economic strife. And you can now start to think on a global stage. And that's evidenced by [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3085.28s)]
*  the PPP data that Sachs shared, where you've seen them become a much larger percentage of global GDP [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3091.36s)]
*  share over the past 10 or 20 years. That's a good metric for that general opportunity to say, Hey, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3097.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm going to shift my priorities now. And that's why maybe now is the time to start to pay attention [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3102.48s)]
*  to what's happening and think about US policy to participate in some reconstruction that's necessary [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3106.48s)]
*  here. I tell you what the most important here is, all this calm, all these conversations seem to [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3113.84s)]
*  come back to energy chamoff, cheap oil, Russian oil, Saudis, UAE, all participating in bricks. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3118.24s)]
*  And then if you look at nuclear, we just had a bunch of, I think it was senators signing a bill, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3124.3999999999996s)]
*  I think you might have tweeted it chamoff of support of nuclear 21 nuclear power plants are [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3129.6s)]
*  being directed at this moment in China, eight in India, United States only has one which is [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3134.72s)]
*  kind of an extension in nuclear nuclear, India just injured, India just turned on its first home [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3139.2s)]
*  built one. So just literally today, so big, big news in India. If we really want to have a great [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3145.2s)]
*  relationship with India, an incredible path and with some of these other countries would be for [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3151.3599999999997s)]
*  us to really invest in these reactors and help people build them and help them get energy [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3155.2s)]
*  independence from Russia's oil, we should be building 50 reactors in India. I don't know [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3160.8799999999997s)]
*  enough. I don't know enough to know whether that's true or not. And part of it is that [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3165.04s)]
*  would like whether we should be building those reactors in quotes, because I don't know what [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UN2Yi_3AE&t=3170.96s)]
