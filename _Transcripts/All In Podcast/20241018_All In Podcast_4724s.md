# Dueling Presidential interviews, SpaceXâ€™s big catch, Robotaxis, Uber buying Expedia?, Nuclear NIMBY
**All In Podcast:** [October 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A)
*  Freeberg's channeling Tim Walls over there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=0.0s)]
*  I know. Wow. He's as excited as Tim Walls. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1.92s)]
*  Got your flannel on. Do you know what a venture capitalist is, Freeberg? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4.32s)]
*  Oh, he's showing SuperGut. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=7.44s)]
*  Well, as of last week, when JCal decided to turn all in into a commercial, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=9.6s)]
*  I was actually going to do a SuperGut background. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=13.76s)]
*  We're launching SuperGut nationwide in Target this week. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=16.56s)]
*  Any Target in the United States, you can go into and pick up SuperGut. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=19.68s)]
*  You can buy the GLP-1 booster. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=23.12s)]
*  You can buy the prebiotic shake. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=26.64s)]
*  I have that, actually. Is that the chocolate? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=29.36s)]
*  Or do you have the mocha? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=31.12s)]
*  I mean, I like the mocha. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=32.8s)]
*  This one's chocolate. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=33.36s)]
*  Okay. Mocha's good, too. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=34.08s)]
*  All right. Let's get started. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Thanks for the support, JCal. I appreciate it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=36.32s)]
*  Of course. Of course. Of course. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=37.92s)]
*  We're cutting all this out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=39.44s)]
*  No way. This is why I do this. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=41.12s)]
*  Next time, plug a company. I have a stake in. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=43.12s)]
*  Also, All In Election Night live stream is coming November 5th. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=59.36s)]
*  You can watch live. Sax will be hosting. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=67.92s)]
*  Oh, we're doing that? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=69.68s)]
*  We're doing it. You're hosting it. Your team said you're doing it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=70.56s)]
*  And so you'll either get to see Sax- [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=73.6s)]
*  Are you not going to Mar-a-Lago, Sax? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=75.68s)]
*  Well, if things continue to look good for Trump, I might go to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=77.84s)]
*  Oh, maybe. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=82.8s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=84.16s)]
*  Well, maybe. Let's not commit Sax. You're maybe. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=85.12s)]
*  If you go to Mar-a-Lago, you're excused. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=87.2s)]
*  I could live stream from Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=88.8s)]
*  Well, that would be amazing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=90.48s)]
*  Absolutely. That would be amazing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=91.84s)]
*  I'll go to Mar-a-Lago. That'd be fun. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=92.64s)]
*  Yeah. If it looks good, I'll go. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=94.0s)]
*  So maybe that's- [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=95.84s)]
*  Just go. Jason's like, I'm just going. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=96.56s)]
*  Of course I'm invited. I talked to Jared. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=98.88s)]
*  If things look as good as they do right now, then I think I'm going to have to go to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=100.56s)]
*  I think we should all be in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=104.32s)]
*  That's going to be a unique experience. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=105.92s)]
*  Oh my God. Can you imagine being in Mar-a-Lago and he loses? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=107.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=111.28s)]
*  That's why I don't want to go. Unless this thing is in the back. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=112.24s)]
*  It's got to be too big to rig. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=115.28s)]
*  If it's too big to rig, I'm going to Mar-a-Lago. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=116.72s)]
*  Too big to rig. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=118.56s)]
*  Do you guys think polymarket is like, why do you think it's different from the polls? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  Are we talking about this today? Polymarket's showing like 60, 40 or 65, 35 now, right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=125.44s)]
*  Yeah, because they're measuring different things. I've explained this before. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=131.92s)]
*  Polymarket is people betting on the outcome. So 58% think Trump's going to win. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=134.32s)]
*  Whereas the polls in a particular state show the percentage of how each person's going to vote. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=139.28s)]
*  So if for sure you knew the election was 51, 49, the betting markets would swing to 100, 0. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=146.48s)]
*  But let me ask you this. So Nate Silver's model, which takes the poll from each state and builds [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=152.24s)]
*  in a kind of a Monte Carlo of super poll, like a super model for the whole country, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=157.44s)]
*  why is his estimate 50, 50 right now while the polymarket is betting at 60, 40? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=164.4s)]
*  It's possible he's laggy in his estimates. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=170.32s)]
*  Got it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=174.48s)]
*  And the betting markets, the betting markets seem to go based on momentum. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=174.8s)]
*  So it indicates the swing in momentum. And then the polls obviously take a week or two. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  How do you think they're going to change after the interviews the last couple of days? Trump on [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  Bloomberg and Kamala on Fox. Do you think those are going to change anything? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=187.84s)]
*  I don't think so. I think it's all baked in now. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, Trump over the past few weeks seems to have had a surge owing to the fact that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=195.36s)]
*  Kamala's interviews generally don't go well. So I think she started off a little behind, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=199.84s)]
*  started doing interviews to catch up, and now she's a lot behind. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=204.0s)]
*  I don't think the bear interview is going to help her. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=207.68s)]
*  Well, let me ask you this. So my observation as, I don't know, I'm not like a super political person [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=210.24s)]
*  or whatever, a party oriented person. I looked at a lot of the media on both sides and it seems like [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=215.52s)]
*  everyone on the left says Kamala did an amazing job on Fox. She defended herself. She showed her [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=222.08s)]
*  skills and her competency. And then everyone on the right, she embarrassed herself. She fell apart. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=226.88s)]
*  And then the same thing happened with the Trump interview on Bloomberg. People are [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=231.12s)]
*  on the left. They say, look at how he couldn't handle the interviewer and he fell apart and all [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  his lies were exposed. And everyone on the right is like, look at him. He got a standing ovation. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=238.39999999999998s)]
*  It's almost like everyone's just kind of self-asserting their beliefs that they already [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=242.0s)]
*  hold when they judge these people on these interview shows at this point. Is it already [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=246.88s)]
*  baked at this point? Is anyone actually going to change their view based on these interviews [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=251.28s)]
*  happening? Well, the question is what appeals to that small sliver of independence. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  The question I would ask back to you is if the Brad Bear interview was going so well for Kamala, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  why was her staff on the sidelines waving to try and end the interview? Apparently they had like [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=267.12s)]
*  four people waving and trying to cut the interview off. Who said that was the case? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=272.72s)]
*  He did. He said it. So it was like in Rocky IV when Apollo Creed's corner is like yelling, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=277.44s)]
*  throw in the damn towel. Throw in the damn towel. They couldn't wait to get her off the stage. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=285.04s)]
*  After 26 minutes. I just think that if it was going that great. I don't think Brad [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  Bear is going to lie about that. I don't know why he would lie about that. Why would they get her [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=294.55999999999995s)]
*  off the stage after 26 minutes if it was going so great? I'm not saying it went as horrible as [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=298.23999999999995s)]
*  some of the partisans on the other side are saying, but I don't think it went that great. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=303.2s)]
*  Do you give her any credit for going into the lion's den like she did? Well, I think that she [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  went, she did the interview precisely to get the talking point that she does adversarial interviews [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=310.64s)]
*  because that talking point was hurting them. And so you saw like all of her fans in the media were [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=316.32s)]
*  saying, well, see, she can walk into the lion's den. But again, she did the shortest interview [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  possible. I don't think she answered the questions directly. I think she filibustered a lot. She [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=325.76s)]
*  deflected a lot. I don't think she was particularly persuasive. I don't think she convinced anybody. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=331.44s)]
*  So I think that what you saw there was somebody who just wanted to get it over with as quickly [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=337.36s)]
*  as possible to check the box on, okay, does adversarial interviews. Trump, on the other hand, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=342.72s)]
*  he actually likes doing these things. The Bloomberg interview- There's no filibustering [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  there, right? Well, no, he's crisp in his answers. It's all filibustered. Come on, man. It's all [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=353.36s)]
*  anecdotes. He can do the weave. He can do the anecdotes, but he's also very good at coming back [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  on the interviewer when they get adversarial. And the audience was with him. They gave him a standing [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=364.88000000000005s)]
*  ovation. He went for 64 minutes compared to her 26. I just think there's no comparison. I think [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=369.84s)]
*  Trump is someone who relishes walking into the lion's den and doing those interviews. I think [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=375.44s)]
*  Harris did it because she felt like she had to. What do you think, Sack? What do you think, Jamath? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  You see it or no? Do you have any opinion? I watched the whole interview. It was clear in [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=383.76s)]
*  the interview, he mentioned the fact that he was being waved off and then he said it after the fact [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=389.28s)]
*  as well. That's not alleged. I think that that did happen. I would say two things. I thought that she [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=394.72s)]
*  was composed and she maintained her cool. So I think from a stylistic perspective, I thought [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=401.12s)]
*  that she did well. From a substance perspective, it was pretty lacking because if you actually [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  listen to the answers, there was just a ton of non-answers. And they were two very basic questions [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  that I think a lot of people, even if you're not a swing voter, I think would probably want to know [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=424.24s)]
*  the answer to. Meaning, did she have any regrets about what's happened in the last three and a half [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=431.2s)]
*  years? Did she have any regrets about what she's done on the border? Has she not noticed that Biden [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=437.04s)]
*  was wavering before he was hot swapped? I think that you could have predicted that these questions [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=444.48s)]
*  were going to come. So I think I was surprised that there wasn't a crisp answer that they had [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=451.52s)]
*  practiced for that. The second thing I'll say is then David is right. Everybody then gets very [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=456.96s)]
*  tribal in how they interpret it. I think I saw one tweet from Elon about how all of the newspapers [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=463.12s)]
*  characterized her interview with Bret Baer as quote unquote testy. And it was sort of like, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=468.56s)]
*  that was the way that the mainstream media framed it. I suspect if somebody looked at how Trump's [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=474.0s)]
*  interview with Bloomberg was analyzed, it probably had some similar verbiage that was repeated there [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=479.36s)]
*  as well. So I think you are right, Jason, that the mainstream media can't be trusted to tell the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=486.16s)]
*  truth. I would just encourage people to watch it. I think, like I said, stylistically, I think she [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=490.72s)]
*  did well and remained composed substantively. I think it was nonexistent. Yeah, it would have [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=495.12s)]
*  been nice to have another debate between these two. She still can't really explain how she's [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=499.68s)]
*  different than Joe Biden, other than the fact that he's a white male and she's a woman of color. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=504.88s)]
*  So beyond the sort of the superficial differences, she can't explain on a policy level what she would [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=509.6s)]
*  do differently. She's had so many opportunities to say that. They asked her on The View, they asked [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=515.28s)]
*  her on Stephen Colbert. Bret Baer asked her in his way, and she still can't explain what she would [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=519.2s)]
*  do differently. And I think that is the fundamental problem she has in her campaign is voters still [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=524.48s)]
*  don't know who she is or what she would do. Yeah. What did you think of JD Vance saying he wouldn't [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=528.96s)]
*  have certified the election? They seem to be going after him on that over and over again. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=535.6s)]
*  You're the only person talking about that. No, no, literally every interview, they've been chasing [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=541.2800000000001s)]
*  him down the hall asking him. I'm not the only person. I may have started it, but what did you [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=545.44s)]
*  think of him saying he wouldn't have started? That is kind of like when he's in a combative [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=548.64s)]
*  reporting moment, that is the question he gets a lot. That's not the interview I saw. I saw the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=552.8000000000001s)]
*  interview he just did with Martha Raditz was she was saying that Trump was exaggerating. No, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=558.64s)]
*  no, the question I asked you, Sax, was I asked you, Sax, about him saying he wouldn't certify January 6. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=563.92s)]
*  You're the only one who's fixated on it. No, I'm just curious. Me and the other journalists. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=568.0s)]
*  What do you think, Free Bird? No one who is persuadable, who doesn't have TDS, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=571.28s)]
*  cares about that topic anymore. What do you think, Free Bird, about him saying he wouldn't [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=574.96s)]
*  certify January 6? That's not what they're asking JD. If you want to talk about interviews that JD [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=579.4399999999999s)]
*  Vance has done, talk about the one that's actually going viral right now. That was the interview he [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=584.48s)]
*  did with Martha Raditz where she starts saying that we've only had a few of these apartment [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=589.28s)]
*  buildings taken over by foreign gangs. He's like, do you realize what you're saying? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=593.44s)]
*  There's no comeback from that. He destroyed her. It was very compelling what he did. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=599.44s)]
*  In every interview he does is like that. Yeah. She was basically saying that she spoke to what [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=604.16s)]
*  was at the city manager. He said only a handful of buildings have been taken over. JD Vance was like, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=610.88s)]
*  what do you mean? Only a handful of buildings. Isn't that anything more than zero, too much? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=616.88s)]
*  Or anything more than one is obviously a problem. It was just such an obvious [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=622.8s)]
*  rebuttal to the narrative that they're over-exaggerating a particular issue. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=627.6s)]
*  I have no data on this, but he was very compelling in that response. I thought it was pretty strong. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=632.72s)]
*  I will say generally, neither candidate seems to be introducing a new message or seems to be [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=637.76s)]
*  introducing new content. They're just standing up, repeating things that they've said, showing that [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=643.92s)]
*  they can handle and manage different combative reporting tactics. That's what's going on. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=651.04s)]
*  Everyone seems to have made up their mind. I see a lot of people on both sides say, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=656.24s)]
*  again, this person did great. My person did great against this combative reporter and the [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=660.72s)]
*  other person did poorly against their combative reporter. Everyone's biased in their view. It [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=665.84s)]
*  just feels like this election is baked and we should just go to the polls and be done. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=670.4s)]
*  There's no October surprise coming out, right, Sax? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=675.6800000000001s)]
*  There hasn't been anything, right? That's kind of a shocking moment yet this month. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=681.36s)]
*  But Freeberg, the question I was going to ask you is, since you're not hosting Trump [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  fundraisers, what did you think when JD Vance said he didn't think that Trump lost the 2020 [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  election? Does that concern you at all? There's no way to answer this with the kind of clean [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  framing I think you're looking for. What I saw from JD is that he wants the reporter and the [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=706.0s)]
*  people that he's talking to, and I hear this from him, to zoom out a little bit and to be able to [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  hear from him, to zoom out a little bit and recognize that there are significant control [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=718.0s)]
*  systems and biases that he believes and others believe are strongly affecting the election [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=725.6s)]
*  process and as a result the election outcome. I think that that message is lost because people [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=731.6s)]
*  want him to say, Trump lost the election, you're not admitting it, you're bad. But those people [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=738.1600000000001s)]
*  also aren't hearing the point that he's making, which is that there are biases. And we heard these [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=744.32s)]
*  biases, by the way, with Democrats in prior elections as well, where they highlighted that [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=749.44s)]
*  they believe that there were biases with respect to misinformation being amplified on social media. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=755.2s)]
*  And then the next election cycle, they were able to step in and influence what was being changed on [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=760.1600000000001s)]
*  those social media platforms. And so there's this big kind of war, media war going on, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=764.4000000000001s)]
*  social media platforms. And I think that that's what both sides are highlighting is their big [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=770.4s)]
*  concern. And now there's this other big concern about is there appropriate voter verification [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=775.2800000000001s)]
*  that the people who are voting, and it's a question to ask that shouldn't be dismissed. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=781.6800000000001s)]
*  It is a good question to ask. As a person who doesn't have a strong bias for a political party [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=786.32s)]
*  here, I feel like I want to hear answers to those questions. What is the structure of how [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=792.8000000000001s)]
*  most people are getting their media today, which is through social media platforms? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=799.84s)]
*  What is the mechanism for censorship? What is the mechanism for filtering for moderation and [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=803.44s)]
*  be public and transparent about it? And then separately, what are the mechanisms for [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=808.4s)]
*  deciding who gets to vote and how they get to vote? And I think those are both really good [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=813.36s)]
*  things to ask. I would just like to take a step back and say that that was one of the most [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=816.4s)]
*  incredible answers I've ever heard, Freeberg. Unfortunately, it may not land for the reductive [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=820.96s)]
*  masses, but it was exceptionally powerful and thoughtful. Thank you. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=829.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're fortunate enough here for you. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=835.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, independent of who wins, we need to get this rules of elections really tight [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=837.36s)]
*  starting next year, I think make it a federal holiday. Require people to have ID that doesn't [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=844.56s)]
*  seem like such a big deal. I don't know, sex, what else should happen? Federal holiday, make it out. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=851.52s)]
*  Biden's DOJ is literally suing the state of Virginia, which is required by Virginia law [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=857.1999999999999s)]
*  to clean the voter rolls of illegal immigrants. And they've been doing that. And Biden's DOJ has [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=863.92s)]
*  sued to stop that. In California, like you said, we now have a new law, Simon Gavin Newsom, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=869.1199999999999s)]
*  to make it illegal to ask for voter ID. So Democrats seem to be undermining the integrity [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=874.56s)]
*  of elections, not fortifying it. So when you ask, you know, why do Republicans distrust elections, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=880.16s)]
*  maybe it has something to do with the way that Democrats are acting. But I agree with you. I [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=886.56s)]
*  think that cleaning up the voter rolls, having a minimum standard for voter verification [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=891.04s)]
*  is something that I think should be done. The corner of the Constitution, the states basically [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=901.04s)]
*  run their own elections, but it doesn't make sense to me that in a one party machine politics [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=905.52s)]
*  state, where basically one party controls the state, that they could set up a system that [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=911.1999999999999s)]
*  effectively entrenches their power forever in federal elections. It just seems to me that the [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=916.64s)]
*  federal government has a compelling interest that must be constitutional in ensuring a minimum [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=921.84s)]
*  standard of honesty in federal elections. So I think it would be great to do something about [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=929.4399999999999s)]
*  this next year. I think that if you want people to stop questioning elections or engaging in [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=933.92s)]
*  election denial, you need to make the elections above reproach. So let's do that. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=939.5999999999999s)]
*  So anyway, Heritage Foundation, which is obviously right leaning, has a bunch of election fraud [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=944.4s)]
*  cases they've been documenting, and they basically cannot come up with like, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=951.76s)]
*  actual evidence that this is changing any election results, but we should make it above reproach. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=956.4s)]
*  I agree. All right, our boy Elon had a big week. Tesla unveiled two new concepts at its WeRobot [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=964.72s)]
*  event, and Elon caught a 23 story rocket, the Starship. Here's the Robo taxi and the Robo bus. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=970.1600000000001s)]
*  Both of them look really awesome. And he caught one of the, I think this is the fifth Starship, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=979.0400000000001s)]
*  or the fourth launch? Fifth. The fifth, right? And then look at this. It's so unbelievable. It's [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=986.72s)]
*  like chopsticks catching. Forget about whatever your issues are with Elon and his politics, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=993.2s)]
*  just to appreciate and we can talk about why this is so important in the segment. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=998.96s)]
*  But technically, the achievement of this like skyscraper falling out of the sky and perfectly [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1004.0s)]
*  aligning itself to go into that chopstick catching device. It is an absolute marvel [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1008.88s)]
*  of human ingenuity. I mean, and the work and the effort that people put into this over, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1015.5200000000001s)]
*  you know, several decades, it's just such an incredible feat. Look at this thing. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1020.4000000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you guys were as emotionally moved by this as I was. I thought it was incredible. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1023.9200000000001s)]
*  I think I probably watched this a hundred times. Totally. From every angle. Every angle. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1027.52s)]
*  And so the reason this is so important is because these things cost a lot of money. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1032.16s)]
*  And when they land here, you can clean them up. And I guess his goal is to have them take off again [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1038.24s)]
*  after he fills them with propellant an hour later, Friedberg. So on a science base, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1043.3600000000001s)]
*  this is extraordinary. If this works and you can start lifting these rockets. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1049.1200000000001s)]
*  You don't want it to have feet. A, it's heavy. And then B, you have to lift them up in a way [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1054.3999999999999s)]
*  that just complicates the entire refueling and cycle time process. So by catching it, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1062.24s)]
*  you put it right back into place and just go again. Unbelievable. Right. You just catch it [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1066.8s)]
*  and go again. I can kind of walk through these numbers. So obviously the big objective over time [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1070.96s)]
*  is how cheap can you get it to put material into space? We need a lot of material to go into space [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1077.92s)]
*  if we're going to do things in space, particularly if we're going to go build a colony on Mars. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1085.8400000000001s)]
*  And so this shows you over time, the cost per kilogram, which is the key metric in this industry [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1091.28s)]
*  to launch material into lower orbit. And you can see here how SpaceX has dramatically reduced the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1096.5600000000002s)]
*  cost. I remember when the small sat era began in the 2010s, do you guys remember all these startups [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1104.64s)]
*  that were starting to build like little small sats and put them up to do imaging and cons and stuff? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1110.3200000000002s)]
*  When this took off, it was about 10,000 bucks a kilogram to put a small sat into space or to [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1115.2800000000002s)]
*  put material into space. And then SpaceX has dropped the cost to the point that it's now [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1121.76s)]
*  close to a thousand dollars a kilogram. So a 10 X reduction in cost in just the last decade or so. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1126.64s)]
*  And that's why SpaceX just dominates the launch market. But Elon's always said that a thousand [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1132.0s)]
*  dollars a kilogram is too high. But his objective has been to get the cost down to 10 bucks a [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1137.04s)]
*  kilogram. Cause at 10 bucks a kilogram, you could launch what some people estimate is needed to get [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1142.1599999999999s)]
*  to Mars, which is about half a million tons of material and people to set up a colony on Mars. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1147.6s)]
*  And it actually becomes feasible to get, you know, half a million tons of material at 10 bucks a [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1154.1599999999999s)]
*  kilogram. So if you look at this new Starship and Starship heavy booster, it's about 150, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1160.32s)]
*  200 ton payload. The booster holds, you know, 3,400 tons of propellant. And the cost of that [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1166.8799999999999s)]
*  propellant is pretty low. You know, it's, it's only about a million dollars in fuel. So then if you [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1175.28s)]
*  can get the cost of the booster and the Starship down enough, and you can reuse it enough, and you [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1182.0s)]
*  amortize the cost of making that device over the lifetime of the device, the cost per launch comes [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1188.0s)]
*  down. And that's what brings the cost per kilogram down. So the booster, there's a group called [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1193.68s)]
*  payload, and they do estimates on this. So I won't speak out of turn in terms of like having [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1197.36s)]
*  inside knowledge, but the payload has estimated that Starship and the booster cost about 90 million [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1200.72s)]
*  bucks today. And they think that they have a path to getting it down to 35 million. So if you can [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1207.36s)]
*  reuse that thing 10 times, that's a $3.5 million cost per launch, plus a million for fuel, you [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1211.76s)]
*  could easily see, and this thing can launch 200 tons. That's how you start to get to 10 bucks a [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1218.32s)]
*  kilogram over the next couple of years. But it was critical to be able to reuse that heavy booster. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1222.64s)]
*  And that's what Elon just demonstrated. It's we can actually catch that heavy booster, refuel it, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1228.16s)]
*  and launch it an hour later. And if you can do that over and over again, you're spending 10 bucks a [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1233.68s)]
*  kilogram to put material into space, you can get fuel into space and then get those Starships to [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1237.76s)]
*  fly off to Mars and deliver all this material, including setting up a base that would allow you [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1242.8799999999999s)]
*  to actually make more fuel on Mars, because everything we need to make fuel is on Mars. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1248.16s)]
*  So it's the beginning of the next series of really important milestones that will hopefully get [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1251.92s)]
*  humanity onto Mars. It was just so amazing to see it come together. The economics are legit. I mean, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1257.52s)]
*  this is like 1000x reduction in cost. It's incredible. Yeah, it's going to be amazing. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1262.88s)]
*  And they're going to do some, I guess, new stuff with Starlink, some even lower Earth orbit [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1268.0s)]
*  satellites that go even faster and have less latency. So that's going to be super exciting. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1272.72s)]
*  Starlink's apparently, I mean, I know everyone here is a shareholder in SpaceX, but Starlink's [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1277.8400000000001s)]
*  running at 4 million subs right now. That's like 100 bucks a month, 4 million subs. And if you do [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1282.16s)]
*  the math, I mean, how many people have ISPs that are slower than Starlink? Right? How many people [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1288.4s)]
*  have cell phone providers that they're paying roughly the same amount that aren't as good as [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1294.24s)]
*  Starlink? If we can get satellite to phone and you can get Starlink more broadly available, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1297.92s)]
*  this could be a hundred million subscriber business. I mean, this could be one of the [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1303.92s)]
*  biggest businesses on the Earth. It could be the largest subscription business in the history of [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1307.44s)]
*  humanity. I think the largest ones right now are like Netflix, 250 Disney plus 150 Verizon, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1312.88s)]
*  a hundred million. So yeah, it could be hundreds of millions of subscribers. It could even be the [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1320.24s)]
*  first 500 million subscriber product in the world. We could look back one day and be like, why did [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1325.92s)]
*  we run all this copper wire everywhere? We don't need it. Yeah, obviously. It's crazy. Especially [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1329.68s)]
*  if it can get to the phones. It would be crazy that we were ever, I mean, the whole nutty thing [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1335.8400000000001s)]
*  about this past week, it's like, we could look back one day and be like, why did we ever drive [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1339.2800000000002s)]
*  cars? And why do we ever have copper wire laid all over the earth to like move internet signals [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1342.08s)]
*  around? You know, this, uh, the sufficiency game that's going to be realized over the next decade [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1345.84s)]
*  is just incredible. Just incredible. Any thoughts on the robo van or the cyber cab, the model two, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1350.1599999999999s)]
*  I guess some people are calling it, but it's, you know, the cyber cab specifically not calling it [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1360.0s)]
*  number two and doesn't have a steering wheel or pedals. I would have bought two of those [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1365.28s)]
*  immediately if it had a steering wheel and pedals. I want to drive it. Yeah. It looks like [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1370.16s)]
*  the hybrid of like a model Y and the cyber truck. So I kind of really love the aesthetics of it. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1373.28s)]
*  So beautiful. Yeah. You like my, my, my reaction was actually, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1378.88s)]
*  I don't know, just seeing these releases now over 10 or 15 years plus of knowing him, nothing. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1385.8400000000001s)]
*  It's, it's, I guess it's like, not that surprising. Maybe it's, it's weird to say, like, I just [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1394.96s)]
*  expect him and his teams to figure it out. Like they're just all so good. It's the thing to [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1400.24s)]
*  remember. It's not just him. That's incredible, but he attracts a kind of technical and operational [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1404.96s)]
*  wonder kind people for sure. And that's just, that's just a really special thing. So I had [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1412.5600000000002s)]
*  that reaction, which was, I was really [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1419.28s)]
*  proud and happy for them. For the team. Yeah, for sure. For the team and for him. These guys are [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1423.44s)]
*  like incredibly fearless fail bigly, right? Yeah. If you're going to fail, fail bigly. Yeah. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1428.96s)]
*  And then the other thing that I thought was crazy was how many people were trying to dunk on him [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1435.6s)]
*  this weekend. And that's weird. It's weird. It caught me off guard because I think that they were [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1441.2s)]
*  personalizing a lot of anxiety that they are feeling through these companies successes, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1447.28s)]
*  which didn't make much sense to me. Well, in fairness, he did hurt some people's feelings [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1454.72s)]
*  with posting of memes. So yeah, I mean, it's, it makes no sense. Like the guy's like gonna save [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1458.3999999999999s)]
*  30,000 road debts a year in the United States with self-driving and people are losing their minds [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1464.8799999999999s)]
*  over a couple of memes or who he's voting for for president. I don't think you have to worry [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1470.56s)]
*  about that. You can just look at the products. They speak for themselves. Anything, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1473.68s)]
*  Sax, any response on the, on the Tesla front and thoughts on the, the bus or optimist? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1480.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, they're both very exciting products. I don't think I've got a lot to add. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1485.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I love the bus free bird. I think that thing could become like mobile homes are, you know, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1489.76s)]
*  ADUs and you could just send them to you. Can we buy them or no? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1494.88s)]
*  Well, no, not right now, but I think that might be, you know, that's gonna be a big question. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1500.96s)]
*  I need it for all my kids. Yeah. Well, see, if this was a platform like the Mercedes Sprinter [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1508.32s)]
*  vans have become that you see a lot in Europe, then you could buy an empty one of these. It's [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1513.1200000000001s)]
*  got enough battery life to last a month. And then let's say you had your in-laws over and there was [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1518.32s)]
*  one that was set up as like a one bedroom. You could click on Airbnb or, you know, Tesla BNB [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1524.0s)]
*  press a button and the thing could drive to your driveway. You could rent it for a week and then [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1530.4s)]
*  it could leave or let's say a thousand people or 10,000 people were displaced because of a hurricane [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1533.84s)]
*  free bird. You could send a hundred thousand of these to the parking lots at Walmart, which [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1538.8s)]
*  typically does a good job in feeding people and getting them supplies after hurricanes. Since [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1543.2s)]
*  those are so ubiquitous, you can put a hundred of these in every parking lot and have a place for [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1547.52s)]
*  people who are fleeing a natural disasters to stay. So I thought that was like the most [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1552.24s)]
*  compelling product of the whole thing for me was the possibility of a sled, like a skiff that you [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1556.4s)]
*  could do anything you want with would be really exciting for society. So congratulations to the [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1561.68s)]
*  team. And it's going to take a while, but I could see them having that robo taxi. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1567.1200000000001s)]
*  I think congrats to Amid. He just got promoted. I saw that. Yeah. He's in charge of all AI. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1573.2800000000002s)]
*  I think he's in charge of all manufacturing and sales in North American. Oh, okay. Well, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1578.88s)]
*  there it is. Shout out to meet after. Yeah. I mean, listen, guys, I have, I have big news. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1584.4s)]
*  I just bought my first Tesla. Oh, you did. Did you go with a plaid model? S model? S plaid. Yeah. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1590.16s)]
*  Yeah. I test drove it for two weeks and sold itself. And are you using the FSD? I use FSD [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1596.5600000000002s)]
*  every day. It was like really impressive. So super impressive. I've tried Tesla a couple of times [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1604.24s)]
*  over the years and I never really, never really worked for me. The quality just didn't feel like [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1609.1200000000001s)]
*  given what I had before the car wise, you were an Audi guy, right? But Audi guy. Yeah. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1614.3999999999999s)]
*  Anyway, it's a, it's a big milestone. I really, I thought the FSD was the selling and then the [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1622.08s)]
*  speed on the plaid is just insane. It's better than my RS7. Like I, um, with all of my Teslas, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1627.4399999999998s)]
*  I put it in show mode because when it's in that plaid mode or whatever, like coffee, it's my [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1632.9599999999998s)]
*  favorite. I love it. But if you have passengers, the kids in the back seat would like literally [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1637.1999999999998s)]
*  nauseous because it's too fast. You gotta be, you gotta be careful with the passengers there. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1642.0s)]
*  It's so fast. It was awesome. Awesome. All right. Well, there you have it. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1646.08s)]
*  Robo taxi star. We didn't get to it last week. We almost put the show back a day or two just to do [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1651.52s)]
*  it. In other news, Uber is exploring a bid to purchase Expedia breaking news. This was dispelled [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1655.76s)]
*  as we got here on the show. They said this was like very preliminary third party talks and that [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1662.24s)]
*  there's no serious talks going on about this. Financial times reported that advisors were trying [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1667.44s)]
*  to look at if a deal structure would be possible between Uber and Expedia. Expedia has got a $20 [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1673.92s)]
*  billion market cap. They popped 8% on the news. Obviously Uber on the other hand, trading at 170 [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1678.96s)]
*  billion market cap or so that dropped 3%. If you didn't know Dara was the CEO of Expedia from 2005 [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1684.3200000000002s)]
*  to 2017, he's still on the board and it looks like this was a trial balloon. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1691.52s)]
*  You know, Uber's two biggest businesses rides and Uber eats, but they also do freight and train [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1698.8s)]
*  bookings. Dara has been pretty clear. He wants to create a super app like you have in China or some [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1703.36s)]
*  other markets. Expedia has got a lot of cool products, hotels.com, Orbit, Travelocity, or, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1710.6399999999999s)]
*  and I think the most interesting one, Preberg, you and I were talking about this is VRBO, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1717.92s)]
*  Vacation Rental by Owner. It was like Airbnb before Airbnb existed. And if you look at this [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1721.76s)]
*  chart, since Dara left the Dara effect, Expedia has gone exactly sideways. The revenue has grown [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1728.3999999999999s)]
*  modestly. What do you think of this deal? Chema, I'll just go right to you with this one, since [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1735.52s)]
*  you like to. Stupid. Stupid. Okay. There you have it, folks. Reason number one, it's stupid. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1742.1599999999999s)]
*  And reason number two, it's stupid. I mean, this is a $20 billion market cap business. You probably [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1749.1999999999998s)]
*  have to pay a control premium of 50%. So the question is, if you were going to spend $30 [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1753.84s)]
*  billion today in the public markets, what would you spend it on? And I think the most important [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1760.8799999999999s)]
*  lens that you have to use to answer that question is, what reinforces a moat that I have [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1766.96s)]
*  while also being inoculated from the risks of AI? And I cannot think of a more fragile business [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1773.3600000000001s)]
*  model than the UI layer on top of widely available data. So the problem that Expedia has is the same [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1782.64s)]
*  that Booking and a bunch of these other folks have, which is that the principal heartbeat of the [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1791.92s)]
*  company, flight information and other things, are licensed to them by third parties. And so what they [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1796.32s)]
*  are is a UI and a front door. I think it's way too early in the evolution of AI to know that that's [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1802.6399999999999s)]
*  safe. And in fact, I think a more reasonable assumption is that those things are pretty fragile. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1809.04s)]
*  And part of what may explain the doldrums of the stock is that I think people are anticipating a [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1814.6399999999999s)]
*  world where, for example, I don't know if you saw about Perpexity launched something this week. It's [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1819.52s)]
*  just in test mode. They white listed me into it, but it's basically a checkout concept. So you tell [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1824.56s)]
*  Perpexity what you would like it to buy, and then it will go and complete the transaction for you. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1831.9199999999998s)]
*  So in the example of flight bookings, you could go directly to United because A, Perpexity will [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1838.1599999999999s)]
*  just show you all of the flights. They'll show you the exact prices, and then it'll go and execute [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1844.6399999999999s)]
*  that for you with your payment method. In a world that looks like that, where these companies have [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1850.48s)]
*  the money to pay for the data feeds, the existing V1.0 generation UIs, I think, are in trouble. So [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1856.64s)]
*  it would just be a very bad capital allocation decision. Now, that's okay to get things wrong, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1866.16s)]
*  but not for $30 billion wrong. You can probably do it for a couple hundred million dollars wrong, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1871.6s)]
*  or maybe even a billion dollars wrong, because you can absorb that as a $150 or $60 billion [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1876.56s)]
*  company. But $30 billion is too big of a price to pay for that kind of risk. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1882.0s)]
*  I would agree with you. And there's other things they could buy, like WeRide or Pony AI, and a bunch [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1885.6799999999998s)]
*  of these AI companies that are doing self-driving. So why not double down on that? Freeberg, the one [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1890.24s)]
*  thing you and I talked about was VRBO, which is a very cool marketplace. And that feels directly in [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1895.76s)]
*  the Uber kill zone. What do you think about them just maybe carving out and buying VRBO and having [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1901.76s)]
*  an Airbnb contemporary? Why don't they just buy Waymo? Why don't they just go to Google and give [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1906.8799999999999s)]
*  them $30 billion of Uber stock and just carve in Waymo? Isn't that a better idea? I think that's [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1911.44s)]
*  what's going to happen. I've been hearing rumblings of that. So I think that Dara knows Expedia better [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1916.32s)]
*  than anyone. He ran the business for, what, a decade or so? Yep. And so he knows how that [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1922.96s)]
*  business operates. And so if he's looking at this thing and the stock price has been flat, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1929.44s)]
*  roughly since he left in 2017, if you look at the underlying financial performance, you could kind of [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1935.1200000000001s)]
*  start to construct a rationale for buying Expedia this cheap. And it would be very accretive to Uber, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1941.52s)]
*  even if there are these big strategic risks on the horizon. So just to give you some numbers on it [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1947.68s)]
*  all, Uber has got about 150 million monthly active users. Expedia has about 45, 50 million [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1954.0s)]
*  customers a year that use the service and pay for stuff. So there's a real opportunity to [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1961.68s)]
*  think about the Uber customer base that's installed as being almost an opportunity to market [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1968.4s)]
*  to them Expedia services and cross-sell. So Expedia on an annualized basis is spending about [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1975.52s)]
*  8 billion a year in sales and marketing and about 720 million a year in G&A costs. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1982.56s)]
*  And they're running about 3 billion EBITDA right now, run rate. So if you cut about half the G&A [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1989.52s)]
*  in an acquisition, because you don't need all the people that overlap with Uber's people, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1995.36s)]
*  and you cut about 30% of the sales and marketing dollars because you can cross-sell into the Uber [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=1999.84s)]
*  install base, you could see a scenario where you could increase Expedia's EBITDA by 75 to 100%, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2004.48s)]
*  maybe getting it as high as $6 billion. And while Expedia's market cap trades at 20 billion, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2012.56s)]
*  this is off of obviously the recent news that they might get acquired. If you assume a 40, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2017.68s)]
*  50% price premium to the last 90 day average of the stock price, which is typical or common for [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2022.8s)]
*  a deal like this, they're probably paying 26 billion for the company. And they got about 4 [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2027.68s)]
*  billion in that cash. So you're kind of paying about 22 billion enterprise value to buy Expedia. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2032.72s)]
*  So 22 billion of enterprise value. And if you can bump the EBITDA up to 6 billion a year, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2038.88s)]
*  that's a pretty low multiple. I mean, you could kind of see yourself rationalizing this just [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2045.04s)]
*  from a financial basis that you're paying four times EBITDA to buy this thing. And Dara knows [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2049.28s)]
*  this thing and he would have great command over what needs to be done over there. And he would [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2053.92s)]
*  have a great sense of what to change and what's gone wrong. And there's a lot of interesting [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2058.32s)]
*  assets inside of Expedia. VRBO is a great one that's been under monetized and underutilized. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2064.4s)]
*  I don't know if you've used the UX on VRBO versus Airbnb. There's obviously some influence Dara [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2068.8s)]
*  could have with people that he knows well that could go in and fix that interface and make it [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2073.44s)]
*  a better service. And even as AI starts to step in and hotels maybe integrate better with agents [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2078.0s)]
*  and so on, and they show up in a more ubiquitous way, there's other things that Expedia does like [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2083.6000000000004s)]
*  build vacation packages and travel packages that are high margin products that they sell [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2088.08s)]
*  that are a little bit different than what you're used to with just booking a flight. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2092.64s)]
*  Booking flights makes no money for anyone, but vacation packages is where all the money's at. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2096.08s)]
*  And so theoretically Expedia could be smarter about how they build vacation packages and [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2100.88s)]
*  personalize them for families. And that's where they can make real margin, like 20, 30% margin. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2105.2799999999997s)]
*  So I could see a story where this all starts to click for the board at Uber saying maybe it [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2110.48s)]
*  makes sense. Dara knows what he's talking about. We could buy this thing for four times, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2114.8s)]
*  pro forma EBITDA. This could be hugely accretive for us. So I think that's why this is happening, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2118.96s)]
*  why this conversation may be happening. That's just me trying to understand. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2123.92s)]
*  I think it's a good steal maybe. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2126.5600000000004s)]
*  What the rationale might be. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2127.6000000000004s)]
*  Could you just go back and explain how would they drive up EBITDA so much? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2128.8s)]
*  So they're spending about $8 billion a year run rate on sales and marketing at Expedia right now. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2132.7200000000003s)]
*  And Uber's got 150 million active installed users that are using the Uber services every month. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2138.88s)]
*  Customers. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2144.24s)]
*  Yeah, actually paying customers. So if Uber could cross sell some number of Expedia services to [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2145.04s)]
*  their installed base at Uber, which they could test and do a little experiment and see if it works, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2152.3999999999996s)]
*  they may be able to reduce the marketing dollars that Expedia is spending to acquire customers [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2157.68s)]
*  through other third party sources like Google and Bing and other places. So there's a rationale. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2161.6s)]
*  That's where I think the logic breaks down. I don't think Uber customers want to be cross sold [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2167.68s)]
*  on booking a hotel. See, this is where I think like MBA thinking is very different than product [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2172.7999999999997s)]
*  thinking. Like an MBA looking at this would say, well, Expedia and Uber are both in the travel [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2177.2799999999997s)]
*  business. Their apps both involve booking trips. So we can cross sell Expedia from Uber and then [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2184.72s)]
*  cut Expedia's marketing budget. I think that's how an MBA would sort of hand wave over it. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2192.64s)]
*  I think the way like a product manager would look at this is to say, what does the user want to do? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2198.48s)]
*  And I know that when I use the Uber app, I just want to basically make a couple of clicks, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2203.2s)]
*  set my destination, get my car, and then move on. And there was a product initiative a few years [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2207.6s)]
*  back at Uber where they tried to capture the user's attention during the ride. And they added- [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2213.68s)]
*  That's right. Yeah, they had that whole ad thing that adds- [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2220.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's making a ton of money. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2222.32s)]
*  And it's actually printing money. It was like an entertainment stream or something [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2224.48s)]
*  inside the app. No, but they dialed it way back because I don't see it anymore. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2228.8s)]
*  It was just clutter. Would you trust Dara's judgment on this, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2232.56s)]
*  Sachs? Like if Dara were to think about what the Uber user would want and he could rationalize some [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2235.52s)]
*  percentage of them they could cross sell Expedia services into. I mean, ultimately, I think it's [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2240.72s)]
*  his decision, right? Well, I mean, what you're describing is basically a private equity play. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2246.0s)]
*  Dara is going to come in as a private equity buyer effectively, and he knows the business [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2251.12s)]
*  and will run it to reduce costs, maybe boost some revenue. And maybe there is a justification for [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2257.28s)]
*  that. But if you're trying to justify it based on cross selling, I don't think users of the Uber app [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2261.2000000000003s)]
*  want to be cross sold when they book a taxi. They just want to be able to affect their transaction [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2266.48s)]
*  as efficiently as possible. And just to finish the point I was making on that whole entertainment [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2272.56s)]
*  stream that they had, they dialed that product way back because it got in the way. You'd be in [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2277.12s)]
*  the Uber app trying to figure out how to change your destination or something. And all of a sudden [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2282.16s)]
*  you're being shown some entertainment product. It's not what users wanted. And it was always [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2285.7599999999998s)]
*  a banana's idea to think that just because the user books an Uber that you own their attention [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2293.68s)]
*  during that ride. Because during that ride you're really competing with every app on the iPhone. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2301.8399999999997s)]
*  And that's the problem is you want to get in and out of the Uber app. It's about transacting [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2307.92s)]
*  efficiently. What about not the moment when you're writing in an Uber, but the moment when you say [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2311.84s)]
*  as an Uber user, hey, I need to book travel. I got to go on a vacation to Austin. I'm never going to [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2317.36s)]
*  think to go on my Uber app for that. The only time I open- But what if they put that feature in there? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2322.0s)]
*  What if they had a tab that said book your travel here? You know when I open the Uber app, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2325.84s)]
*  when I want to hail a taxi, that's what it's like. It's like I'm bringing the guy. There are a large [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2329.44s)]
*  number of people who maybe don't have an assistant to book their hotels in advance. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2333.84s)]
*  That would be most people, J. Cal. I would not think to go into Uber to do that. It would [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2339.76s)]
*  just be clutter. Well, no. They already have a hotels.com partnership. And then the Uber [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2344.56s)]
*  One membership has been growing pretty nicely. And the advertising is doing a billion dollars a [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2349.1200000000003s)]
*  year. And that is just a money printing machine. Because you know that this person's in an Uber [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2352.7200000000003s)]
*  black. You know that they're going to the Four Seasons. These users who are- They have a real ad [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2357.28s)]
*  business at Uber. Yeah. Yeah. The more Uber tries to promote some unrelated product, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2363.12s)]
*  and what I mean by unrelated is it doesn't help you get to where you're going that moment. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2369.04s)]
*  It's clutter in the app. What about Uber Eats, Zach? Yeah. Well, no. It's working pretty well. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2373.52s)]
*  It's working great. Yeah. No, the cross-promotion is working. That is highly related to this. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2377.8399999999997s)]
*  Basically booking a car to pick up some food. Yeah. It's still the taxi business basically. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2382.0s)]
*  I think the hotel's integration is good. I think there's something here. We have gone [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2386.7999999999997s)]
*  through a cycle where apps and attention were highly consolidated with a few. Now the pendulum [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2392.08s)]
*  has swung the other way. And apps are very narrow features that are really well described. Okay. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2397.68s)]
*  So that's sort of where we are. That's why we have the billions and billions of apps in the app store. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2404.8s)]
*  The question is, does the pendulum swing back to these super apps? And I think the big question is [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2410.4s)]
*  not whether it swings back to the super apps, but whether there's a new substrate that puts itself [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2415.04s)]
*  between the user and all of these services so that they become data-oriented services. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2420.64s)]
*  And this is where the question is, if you rely on an agent or you rely on a beef tub version of [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2426.16s)]
*  search, whether that's chat GPT or Gemini or whatever, why would you care where all of this [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2433.7599999999998s)]
*  stuff was done? You're not going to care. And this is, I think, the big mistake in this thinking is [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2440.48s)]
*  that that real estate is actually much more fragile than I think we all think it is. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2446.08s)]
*  And I think a much better way to think about this is in the future, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2452.48s)]
*  none of this UI real estate is actually worth anything. The question is, do you have a data [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2455.44s)]
*  asset that's valuable or do you do a service that's viable? Because agentically, there'll be all of [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2460.72s)]
*  these unemotional bots and workflows doing this work for you. So I think Sachs is right in the [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2466.24s)]
*  sense that whether it's there or not, it won't matter. Could he run it like a private equity [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2471.92s)]
*  business where now Uber corporation owns two services? Sure. But you're probably just better [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2477.28s)]
*  off for these agents to go and cannibalize all of search because you'll be able to just get a data [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2483.84s)]
*  feed for what Expedia has to create Expedia for a few million dollars or tens of millions of dollars. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2489.92s)]
*  You don't need to pay 20 or 30 billion dollars for this. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2495.44s)]
*  The thing that I've talked to Dara about is when they said he told me when they do something that's [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2499.36s)]
*  adjacent to what they're already doing, it explodes in terms of engagement. So like, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2503.92s)]
*  they're doing like teens and rental cars, and then package delivery. And every time they do one of [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2508.7999999999997s)]
*  those adjacencies, it just takes off with the membership. And to your point, Freiburg, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2514.08s)]
*  they have those 150 customers who have their credit cards in there. And man, it just it's explosive. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2519.6s)]
*  So that's what I think they're doing. I think hotels would be I don't think flights would be [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2525.2s)]
*  because I think the flights work really well with the existing apps. But things where you have [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2532.48s)]
*  proprietary inventory like VRBO or hotels, I think those would be very powerful. And those have 20, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2536.24s)]
*  30% commissions, which are in line with the commissions that Uber is already getting. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2541.7599999999998s)]
*  And the commissions on things like flights is very small, like a couple of dollars. So I think for [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2547.68s)]
*  hotels and VRBO would be brilliant for the other stuff. I'm not so sure to your point, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2552.16s)]
*  Chamath. Well, just to finish my thought was that you'll notice that Uber eats a separate app [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2556.56s)]
*  from Uber, right? I mean, I know you can get to the eats part within Uber, but they created a [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2563.2s)]
*  separate app for a reason is because whether you're using Uber eats or Uber, the goal is immediate [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2567.6s)]
*  gratification. I want to get to where I'm going. I don't book it six hours in advance. I call it [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2572.3199999999997s)]
*  right now. And the most important thing to me is wait time. This is why Uber is beating lift is [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2577.76s)]
*  the wait time is lower. Same thing with food. I'm not thinking about booking my dinner right now. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2583.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to do it in advance. If you browse through the restaurants, the most important piece [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2587.84s)]
*  of data they show you, in addition to the rating is the number of minutes it takes for it to get [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2591.6800000000003s)]
*  to you. So those apps are all about immediate gratification. And that's why you don't want other [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2596.8s)]
*  things getting in the way of them. Now, I guess the claim is somehow you're going to be able to [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2602.1600000000003s)]
*  cross sell the booking of a vacation or a hotel that you have to think about days or weeks in [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2607.12s)]
*  advance. This is a completely different state of mind. I just don't think that there's much [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2612.7999999999997s)]
*  opportunity to cross sell that. Or to use the typical jargon. I don't think the attach rate [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2617.8399999999997s)]
*  is going to be high. What about the brand value, Zach? So because you know, those people are going [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2623.8399999999997s)]
*  to another app to book their flight in their hotel. What if that other app was called Uber [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2628.56s)]
*  Travel? There might be some value in that. I can see that. I think that would be the rationale [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2632.96s)]
*  where I could see the Expedia brand. Yeah. So maybe what you could do is take VRBO, rebranded as Uber [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2638.2400000000002s)]
*  hotel or Uber travel, whatever you want to call it. And then maybe you could push people to download [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2644.96s)]
*  that app. Well, the thing I would counter, I would give to this. You could quantify the value of the [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2651.44s)]
*  installs, right? So yeah, exactly. I mean, well, you could quantify because Expedia is spending on [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2657.04s)]
*  it every year right now. I use the BombVoy app to book hotels. I use United to book my flights. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2661.44s)]
*  And I use Uber to do my rides. And obviously for eats, when you are using it, there's a tab up top [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2666.08s)]
*  in the UI is quite nice in Uber where it's rides and eats right next to each other. I could see a [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2671.92s)]
*  third one, like hotels or travel being right there. And all of a sudden, yum, yum, you just get all [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2676.08s)]
*  that inventory right in there. And I frequently will book my hotel and I'll book my ride for the [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2682.4s)]
*  next day in advance on Uber and I do those things. And then when I get to my hotel, I'm ordering food [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2688.7999999999997s)]
*  to my room. So I think this actually could work really well as a third tab in the app for travel. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2694.0s)]
*  And you could actually, because when you use eats in the Uber app, it's its own tab and it's the [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2700.24s)]
*  exact same experience. I believe in super apps. And they just launched a bus that's like a bus [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2705.2s)]
*  service in New York for 18 bucks to go to JFK. That's really awesome. I think we're a little bit [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2710.08s)]
*  disconnected because we don't book our own travel, but okay, let's keep moving here. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2714.0s)]
*  Down the docket. All right, this big tech investing in nuclear power is off to the races. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2718.2400000000002s)]
*  Chema, Amazon just announced a $500 million investment in three nuclear power projects. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2725.2000000000003s)]
*  All of these are focused on SMRs. Those are the small modular reactors. Amazon is working with [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2730.7200000000003s)]
*  Dominion Energy to develop a small modular nuclear reactor near an existing nuclear power [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2738.0s)]
*  plant in Virginia. In total Amazon plans to invest 35 billion in Virginia based data centers by 2040. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2743.44s)]
*  And they want to power these by SMRs. And this is a big trend Google is purchasing energy directly [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2751.28s)]
*  from Kairos power another company building SMRs Microsoft as you heard was reviving one of the [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2758.2400000000002s)]
*  three mile island nuclear power plants. So this is kind of interesting. We went from nuclear not [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2764.88s)]
*  being on the table everybody being against it, the Germans shutting down their reactors, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2772.08s)]
*  post Fukushima. And now big tech is the customer for these with AI and they're putting down very [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2776.88s)]
*  large deposits and payments to build them in America. And I haven't heard any opposition. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2783.92s)]
*  Maybe you could just speak to Chema. What we've seen here in terms of opposition to these versus [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2789.92s)]
*  the opportunity and everybody's writing checks. Yeah. Well, they're not writing checks. So this [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2795.2799999999997s)]
*  is what I don't want to be a Debbie Downer here, but these press releases need to have an asterisk [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2799.92s)]
*  on them. So in the hierarchy of deals, right, just to unpack this for a second, there are deals where [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2806.2400000000002s)]
*  you give me X and I give you money. That's not what this is. Then if you degrade that kind of [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2812.0s)]
*  deal structure in a lot of heavy industry, you have deals that are called take or pay, which is [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2818.48s)]
*  there is something that's working and you need to basically take this or you need to give me the [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2824.7200000000003s)]
*  monetary equivalent of what I'm selling you. That's not what this is. What this is, is sort [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2829.52s)]
*  of this conditional obligation where the beginning of the deal starts with a very important statement, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2836.24s)]
*  which is if it works and if these approvals happen and there's a whole bunch of nested ifs, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2841.2s)]
*  then payments can happen. So while these are important deals, because they show that there [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2848.96s)]
*  are potential buyers at the finish line, what it doesn't do is solve the two things that you need [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2854.4s)]
*  to get to the finish line, which is the actual risk capital to finish building these things and [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2863.28s)]
*  technically de-risk them. And then the regulatory approval that you need to make sure that they're [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2869.44s)]
*  allowed. So I think that these deals are good. I think it's a great signaling, but I think it's [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2875.04s)]
*  important to understand the nuances of these things. These are not things where there's money [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2880.4s)]
*  really trading hands. And until that you see that where irrespective of what happens, the balance [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2886.7200000000003s)]
*  sheet is investing from an Amazon or a Google where there's corp dev folks writing a hundred [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2893.12s)]
*  million dollar or billion dollar checks into these companies. It's not yet quite there. This is more [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2899.2000000000003s)]
*  the step before, which is sort of, can you create some marketing and some buzzy-ness to hopefully [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2905.36s)]
*  induce somebody to then rip in billions of dollars of risk equity capital? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2912.1600000000003s)]
*  Freberg, your thoughts on SMRs and these customers showing up. And then I guess you could comment on [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2917.92s)]
*  the nature of the deal structure here, because some of them are contingent on the nuclear power [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2923.36s)]
*  plant turning on. Some of them do have deposits is my understanding. We'll look that up and fact [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2930.56s)]
*  check it. It could be a range of deals here. Yeah. I don't know the nature of the deals. I did, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2934.48s)]
*  I think talk about this a year ago. It was also like my prediction for the year was to buy the [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2941.28s)]
*  uranium stocks predicated on what I think is a really important point, which is as GDP per [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2946.32s)]
*  capita grows, energy consumption per capita grows. And if you looked at the projections of GDP per [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2954.32s)]
*  capita in industrialized nations, there is no way to meet the energy demand. And this was even [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2961.44s)]
*  pre all this crazy AI build out, which is probably part of the GDP growth. But there is no way to [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2969.84s)]
*  meet the energy demand without nuclear. There is not enough solar geothermal or wind build out [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2975.92s)]
*  potential that's happening that the stop gap measure is going to have to be in probably the [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2985.6s)]
*  right long-term solution is to have a significant amount of base load come from nuclear. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2990.8s)]
*  And so what's the fastest way to do that nuclear build out? Well, in China, they have the regulatory [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=2996.1600000000003s)]
*  authority and the mandate stated they're going to build 300 gigawatts with 300 facilities or [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3001.2000000000003s)]
*  whatever the number is. And that's what they're doing. Very large facilities that make a gigawatt [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3006.4s)]
*  of power each in the U S it seems that because of the regulatory structure here and the way that [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3010.6400000000003s)]
*  utilities are regulated and the way that the States have authority and the environmental laws [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3016.1600000000003s)]
*  and all the other things that it might be the fastest path to solving this energy gap problem [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3020.56s)]
*  is SMRs. And that's why we and these things produce tens of megawatts. So again, a gigawatt [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3026.48s)]
*  is 1000 megawatts. And, you know, we need to kind of probably grow our energy production in [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3032.32s)]
*  the United States by several terawatts over the next decade or two. So this SMR may be the fastest [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3039.2799999999997s)]
*  path. Now that could change meaning we could end up seeing much larger facilities get built out [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3047.68s)]
*  if there's regulatory change in the U S and there's more availability, but fundamentally, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3053.44s)]
*  we are going to need to use uranium to make electricity to meet the demand of the growing [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3057.7599999999998s)]
*  the GDP that it seems we're going to be growing it. I think this is just such a necessity. It's [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3066.0s)]
*  great to see the SMR is getting some attention. I just don't know if they're actually going to [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3070.7999999999997s)]
*  get turned on how long it's going to take. And, you know, I don't know what this election cycle [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3074.32s)]
*  is going to bring in terms of regulatory change. I think we talked about it with several of the [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3078.6400000000003s)]
*  candidates when we were doing the interviews. Sax, if we are able to get a bunch of these [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3081.44s)]
*  SMRs built here in the United States, maybe if Europe follows suit, what would this do on [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3086.6400000000003s)]
*  a geopolitical basis into our relationship with the Middle East, our energy independence, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3092.6400000000003s)]
*  and of course the AI race to, you know, general intelligence, I'll let you take it whichever [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3099.36s)]
*  direction you want to go. Well, I don't think we're going to because I don't think anyone wants a [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3106.48s)]
*  nuclear power plant in their backyard. It's really simple. I mean, no matter what the benefits are [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3110.96s)]
*  for AI or for America's global competitiveness, I just don't think your typical community wants [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3115.6000000000004s)]
*  a nuclear power plant in their backyard. And I don't think it matters that much if it's a small [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3121.76s)]
*  modular one either. So you think they'll get blocked by local communities? Yeah, and probably [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3125.6s)]
*  for good reason. I mean, I don't want a nuclear power plant in my backyard. Do you? I feel like [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3130.0s)]
*  this has suddenly become a little bit of a luxury belief where liberal elites are always talking [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3135.92s)]
*  about how we need to have nuclear power now, but they know they're not going to have a nuclear [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3141.12s)]
*  power plant in their backyard. So it's easy for all of us to genuflect about what a great idea [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3145.44s)]
*  this is. But let's face it, these things are going to be built probably in poor or working [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3150.8s)]
*  class communities. And inevitably, there's going to be some accident. I mean, you can tell me how [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3157.44s)]
*  safe they are to your blue in the face. I don't believe it. You know, planes aren't supposed to [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3162.1600000000003s)]
*  fall out of the sky either. And it does happen. And you know, they're going to set up a power, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3166.96s)]
*  one of these power plants somewhere. And you know, it's probably gonna have a DEI program. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3172.0s)]
*  And somebody's gonna happen. I mean, something's gonna happen. And then the fallout is literally [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3177.6s)]
*  gonna fall out on the people in that poor community. So I don't think this is gonna happen. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3184.64s)]
*  This show really has a diversity of views, doesn't it? Look, this is a perfect example of [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3189.36s)]
*  liberal business elites demanding something that isn't going to affect them. It's not going to [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3195.12s)]
*  your take on a non binary trans lesbian with purple hair, whatever you're saying, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3201.4399999999996s)]
*  a small nuclear reactor, 200 miles outside of Austin, Texas, go. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3210.56s)]
*  For your tinfoil hat. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3216.48s)]
*  Yeah, how close do you want it to your ranch, J. Cal? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3217.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think there's plenty of land outside of the triangle here in Texas, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3219.9199999999996s)]
*  where there is no density and you could put one and have no problem with there being 100 miles, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3227.6s)]
*  200 miles, gonna work there. Who's gonna service it? I mean, literally, you would have to, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3232.08s)]
*  it doesn't take that many people to service these. So yeah, I mean, I think there's plenty of space [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3237.36s)]
*  in the United States to put these and maybe free break, you could talk and educate us [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3242.88s)]
*  on the safety here. Do you believe what sax is saying that it's going to have a meltdown? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3248.4s)]
*  I think taxes point of view, to be honest, is the point of view that will be held by a large [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3253.68s)]
*  number of people, just like they have been with a lot of other is the right point of view though. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3261.04s)]
*  Tell us from a science perspective. Well, no, no, I don't think it is. I think that the same argument [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3266.64s)]
*  would have been made around, we shouldn't have airplanes at all because they can fall from the [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3270.8s)]
*  sky. We should keep everyone on the ground where they're safe. Why would you want to get on an [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3275.2000000000003s)]
*  airplane? Why would you want to have airplanes flying over your home? We should all ban airplanes [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3278.64s)]
*  flying over our home. They could crash in our home. It's the same sort of argument. And the [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3281.92s)]
*  reason I'm not going to argue the point is because of the point I made earlier, which is that it [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3285.44s)]
*  ultimately becomes an economic necessity that for us to meet all of the demands of AI, all of the [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3290.32s)]
*  demands of industry, we want to re-industrialize the United States, etc, etc. We need to increase [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3296.2400000000002s)]
*  electricity production capacity on the continent. And there is no way to generate enough electricity [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3300.88s)]
*  on this continent fast enough using other means than there would be if we just got these [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3306.8s)]
*  these systems set up. So you believe they will go through out of necessity? [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3312.0800000000004s)]
*  That's your take. I think globally, this is the case. And we're seeing it in China. Now, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3316.2400000000002s)]
*  where the US whether the US is becoming a Luddite. China doesn't have to worry about a NIMBY problem. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3319.44s)]
*  The CCP just says, that's what we're going to do. Yeah, that's right. And we may end up being the Luddite. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3322.7200000000003s)]
*  China is the M in NIMBY. My. Yeah. And we may end up being the Luddite state. And we'll end up just [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3328.0s)]
*  saying, you know what, we're not going to adopt new technology, including things like gene editing [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3333.44s)]
*  and cell cell therapies. And I'll go through the list of new technology sets. You could make the [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3337.68s)]
*  argument that there's a low probability of a high risk event. But the fact is that the progress that [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3342.7200000000003s)]
*  it enables is worth so much more than the risk that we would be taking on. There's a simpler solution [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3348.2400000000002s)]
*  to all of this without having to go and create these reactors, which is I don't think that we [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3353.52s)]
*  have a very good grasp of the material science. Broadly speaking, I don't think we really understand [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3358.32s)]
*  how to build next generation materials. I don't think our specialty chemicals capabilities are [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3363.44s)]
*  all that strong the way that they're going to be over the next five or 10 years, just with better [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3367.92s)]
*  compute. So I think that there's going to be a lot of interim steps that increase the generally [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3372.4s)]
*  available energy density without going to nuclear. I think there's going to be a lot of businesses to [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3377.12s)]
*  do that. That'll be much safer, easier to regulate, easier to test, easier to underwrite. And I think [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3381.68s)]
*  the government will get behind those. So I'm not as negative as you are on the only solution being [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3388.16s)]
*  nuclear. The countries and the businesses that have a lower cost of electricity and a more [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3392.32s)]
*  abundant source of electricity will end up winning as the economy continues to progress towards a [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3398.7200000000003s)]
*  much more kind of digital state and automated state over the next decades. So if we're going [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3403.84s)]
*  to be slower, we're going to suffer the consequences of that as a country. So we'll see how it plays [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3408.48s)]
*  out. I just think that economic incentives will ultimately drive hopefully a change. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3412.96s)]
*  Would a possible solution be to give an economic incentive to the people who would be in the [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3416.4s)]
*  surrounding areas? Obviously, these things could be 50 or 100 miles from, you know, anybody's homes, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3422.56s)]
*  but even the people who work there or people who might have I don't know, some homes that were near [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3427.84s)]
*  it, could you give them no taxes, etc, etc, essentially give them incentives to allow this [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3434.32s)]
*  to go through a free break in your mind? Do you think that kind of incentive would work? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3440.0s)]
*  Taxes or some kind of payoff or subsidy? I'm not sure. I haven't thought much about [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3443.2799999999997s)]
*  like what the incentives or subsidies would be. I think that- [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3448.96s)]
*  You're going to have to give them an incentive because no one's going to want to live within [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3451.7599999999998s)]
*  200 miles of one of these things. What would be the number of free-breaking miles? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3454.4s)]
*  I think that people have a very deep fear of, you know, what is deemed to be cataclysmic technology. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3457.3599999999997s)]
*  I do think a lot of this was rooted in the evolution of the atomic age, where we basically [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3465.2s)]
*  have these nuclear warheads mounted to missiles that can travel through the world. And I think [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3468.4s)]
*  that's a very good example of what we're talking about. I mean, you know, if you're going to [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3472.56s)]
*  have a nuclear warhead, you're going to have to travel at 20 times the speed of sound [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3475.84s)]
*  and land on your city and wipe out your city. I mean, that is also nuclear technology. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3480.0s)]
*  And people can flake the two as being similar. And even Three Mile Island, there were, you know, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3484.96s)]
*  no deaths. It was a shocking, scary thing for people. But statistically speaking, and historically [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3489.68s)]
*  speaking, and technically speaking, it's a lot more complicated to explain to people what happened [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3495.44s)]
*  simple. Do you really want a nuclear power plant in your backyard? No way. What about you? No way. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3499.8399999999997s)]
*  All right. Let's vote to stop it. And they're right. I mean, you compare it to commercial [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3504.72s)]
*  airlines, but commercial airlines, that's the technology that's been around for what, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3511.52s)]
*  like 100 years. Do you have any data on the safety record of nuclear technology? Because I'm not sure [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3515.2799999999997s)]
*  you do. I think my point is like, you're just making a statement out of fear. Where's the data? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3519.6s)]
*  Yeah, let's do it. Let's do it right now. I mean, I think this is an important discussion. I'd like [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3524.0s)]
*  to actually... My point about commercial airlines is we've had that technology for over 100 years. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3527.76s)]
*  It was honed and refined over many decades. And commercial airlines now have become... [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3532.2400000000002s)]
*  This is going on almost 100 years of use, right? You know that. There have been incidents every [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3538.2400000000002s)]
*  decade or two. And that is why... That's not true. That's not true. You're saying something [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3544.5600000000004s)]
*  that's not true. The reason nuclear has been discredited is because of Three Mile Island [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3548.32s)]
*  and Fukushima and Chernobyl. First of all, it's not been discredited. I mean, these names live in [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3552.56s)]
*  infamy. It's social fear-mongering like you were doing right now with no data and no facts to try [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3557.6s)]
*  and make it a political issue that drives everyone to one side, shut their minds down, and not listen [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3562.96s)]
*  to the actual facts and data. And this fear-mongering is what keeps us from being competitive, what keeps [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3567.92s)]
*  us from having progress. You talk a lot about people talking shit about Elon. I'm not fear-mongering. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3573.36s)]
*  Listen, listen. I'm just saying I don't want one near me. Now, if they're... Hold on a second. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3577.04s)]
*  There were 46 deaths at Chernobyl. I'm not against doing it somewhere where the community [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3582.7999999999997s)]
*  is in favor of doing it. So if you can find a place that wants to do this, I would not stop it, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3587.9199999999996s)]
*  just to be clear. I'm just saying I don't want one near me. Let's get to facts. Yeah, we got you. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3593.04s)]
*  Jake, just give me a second. Yeah. I don't think you're going to find many takers, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3597.04s)]
*  even among poor communities. It's a great adversarial point. Let's go to the facts. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3601.2s)]
*  There's 440 nuclear power reactors operating in 32 countries around the world. Since the time that [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3605.7599999999998s)]
*  we first had nuclear reactors, which has now been almost a century, there have been three incidents, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3611.84s)]
*  Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Three Mile Island. At Three Mile Island, there were zero deaths. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3616.4s)]
*  At Fukushima, there was one death. And at Chernobyl, there were 46 deaths. The fallout [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3620.6400000000003s)]
*  from those events has been that we shut down energy production, we shut down nuclear reactor [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3625.76s)]
*  technology, and we fear-mongered our way into losing the most abundant available low cost [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3631.04s)]
*  energy. Do those deaths actually include the second and third order effects of all this radiation? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3637.28s)]
*  At Chernobyl, there were 15 people who got thyroid cancer, 35 operators and first responders who got [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3642.0s)]
*  radiation sickness. And then the background radiation effects, there's a lot of kind of [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3646.96s)]
*  noise around this, but it's not a significant number as you may otherwise think. Same with [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3651.44s)]
*  Fukushima. Why is it that whole region is still uninhabited then? They had a radiation event. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3655.76s)]
*  There's radioactive material that has covered that area that will be radioactive for a long [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3660.56s)]
*  period of time. Now, to understand what happened there and why that won't happen again requires [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3664.8s)]
*  talking about the difference in the technology between Gen 1, Gen 2, Gen 3, and Gen 4 systems. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3670.0800000000004s)]
*  A lot of what's being rolled out now are these Gen 3 nuclear reactors. And the Gen 4 systems, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3675.04s)]
*  which we highlighted a little while ago, do not have a meltdown possibility. We talked about this, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3679.6000000000004s)]
*  the one that went online in China in December. Those new systems, the Gen 4 reactors, cannot [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3684.7200000000003s)]
*  melt down. You cannot have an incident like you did with the Gen 1 and Gen 2 systems. And the Gen [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3689.6800000000003s)]
*  3 systems are abundantly safe. China is building hundreds of them. It is a totally understandable [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3694.72s)]
*  science. If we want to spend the time looking at the data and understanding the engineering [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3701.7599999999998s)]
*  and the material science work and all the effort that's gone in, billions of dollars over decades, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3705.2799999999997s)]
*  the biggest stumbling block and the biggest wall has been the fact that people have this [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3710.24s)]
*  fear-mongering activity that they tell people, just dismiss it. It's too scary. We don't want [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3714.8799999999997s)]
*  it in our backyard. Let's move on to the next opportunity. That's what's killed it. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3720.48s)]
*  And if you just put these things 50 miles away, the radiation, even in the meltdowns, didn't [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3724.2400000000002s)]
*  go past those, is my understanding. So even if you want to just the easiest steel manning of this- [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3730.32s)]
*  The new systems don't melt down. You don't have that possibility. And the SMRs- [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3736.32s)]
*  I am in 100% agree with you. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3739.84s)]
*  The new systems don't even work. These SMRs, they don't work. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3740.48s)]
*  That may be another point. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3743.76s)]
*  If they're so new, how can you say for sure what the safety record's going to be? [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3744.2400000000002s)]
*  Just to be clear, SMRs don't work yet. We have theoretical ways in which we can profile and [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3748.16s)]
*  model that they work, but we don't have a functional one that people can look at and inspect. As part of [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3753.8399999999997s)]
*  that, we haven't been able to test how they fail. Those are also theoretical. So I think, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3759.8399999999997s)]
*  let's put SMRs off and let's just be very accurate. We don't have a functioning working version of one [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3765.12s)]
*  because they don't work yet. Maybe they'll work in the future. Let's hope that they do. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3770.64s)]
*  There's about six- [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3774.56s)]
*  What you're talking about, Freeberg, is a step before them, which is the Gen 3 reactor, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3775.04s)]
*  which has a different safety- [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3779.52s)]
*  There are SMRs operating in China, Russia, and India today. And there's about 65 being built [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3780.4s)]
*  at this moment. And that's outside the US. So that's why the US is observing and trying to [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3785.92s)]
*  catch up and adopt these technologies that are being used by, call it, economic competitors [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3791.28s)]
*  and economic partners around the world. It's important for economic prosperity in the US [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3796.0s)]
*  for us to have a degree of competitiveness and electricity prices. If China races towards [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3801.44s)]
*  five cents per kilowatt hour for electricity, and we're sitting here at 20 cents a kilowatt [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3805.92s)]
*  hour for electricity, what's that going to do to our economic competitiveness? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3810.16s)]
*  We are at five cents in the generation. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3813.12s)]
*  You're saying solar, right? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3816.08s)]
*  We can fix that tomorrow. We already rely on a nuclear reactor that works. And to Sachs's point, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3817.36s)]
*  it just happens to be millions of miles away. So if it goes, we're all going to go anyways. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3822.2400000000002s)]
*  The scalability of solar in terms of getting us to a terawatt of production capacity is the [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3827.68s)]
*  limiting block to mop that in order to get to a terawatt of- [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3832.16s)]
*  I think that's a material science problem. I don't think that's you don't need to run- [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3834.56s)]
*  Maybe it's not such a bad thing that other countries are taking the early adopter risk [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3837.84s)]
*  of this technology. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3841.44s)]
*  That's a decade in the making, Sachs. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3842.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. But if China runs away with this and they have so many of these running, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3845.12s)]
*  and then they're able to power AI and solve problems we're not, we're going to have to [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3850.96s)]
*  get our act together and start standing these up. And they just have to be 50- [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3855.2s)]
*  Every Navy submarine's got a nuclear reactor on board. That's how it gets powered. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3859.52s)]
*  We have so much space in this country. These things could be 100, 200 miles away. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3861.7599999999998s)]
*  But I don't think energy is a limiting factor in our ability to innovate. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3866.56s)]
*  I don't think it is today. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3870.96s)]
*  In these data centers? Certainly. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3872.3999999999996s)]
*  It's not the limiting factor in our ability to innovate. It's not the limiting factor in, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3874.0s)]
*  like for example- [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3878.3199999999997s)]
*  We're asking us to charge up every car, every night with electricity, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3879.3599999999997s)]
*  with a battery rather than using gasoline. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3882.3199999999997s)]
*  Let me just make my point. So we just saw OpenAI launch strawberry. Is the reason why [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3883.92s)]
*  Microsoft or Google or Meta not responded with their own version an energy problem? [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3890.0s)]
*  No. We're still rate-limited by innovation and just raw intellectual horsepower and capability. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3897.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, we are trying to solve the energy problem, and people are taking different approaches. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3904.16s)]
*  There's storage that's coming online very aggressively. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3910.8799999999997s)]
*  The solar capability itself is ramping up aggressively. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3914.3999999999996s)]
*  We're also forcing these utilities to actually be deconstructed so that there's more efficiency in [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3918.0s)]
*  the energy markets. All of this, if you unpack why it costs 20 cents a kilowatt hour, it's not [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3922.64s)]
*  because of a generation problem. It is not. It's graft, it's corruption, it's old legacy infrastructure. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3928.0s)]
*  All of it can be replaced in a much simpler and safer way. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3935.6s)]
*  I think by the time that you are rate-limited by energy, you'll have a plethora of solutions. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3938.88s)]
*  My issues with the SMRs is the ones that are promising these next-gen whiz-bang [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3944.08s)]
*  performance characteristics. They're all theoretical, Freebrew. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3950.16s)]
*  Even when you say there are SMRs working abroad, there's no next-generation reactors working [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3953.6s)]
*  abroad. They don't work. Where is an example of these modern next-generation reactors [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3958.08s)]
*  actually working? Where? [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3963.7599999999998s)]
*  We talked about the Gen 4 one that went live in China. There are several SMRs in several [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3966.3999999999996s)]
*  countries that are active, producing power. You can call it a small modular reactor. What [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3970.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm talking about, these next-gen materials, the things that Kairos and these other guys [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3975.04s)]
*  are trying to do, where is a functioning, working version? [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3978.24s)]
*  Here, I'll show you. They have them. We have one in India, we have one in China. I'll send [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3980.3999999999996s)]
*  you links to them here. There's about 50 of them that India is actively building right now. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3986.08s)]
*  They're competitive with Kairos. They all have common design concepts, but they're different [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3990.16s)]
*  companies. Anyway, I'm just saying they're getting rolled out. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3996.56s)]
*  What would be the harm, and just Freebrew, maybe you can educate us, in the distance [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=3999.68s)]
*  it could be from a city, reasonably in terms of building a grid to move the energy from, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4003.68s)]
*  could it be 200 miles from a major city, 300, 100? What's the distance? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4010.24s)]
*  You could put power production wherever you want. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4016.08s)]
*  But it has to travel. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4017.8399999999997s)]
*  As long as you got the copper to move it, right? You move the electrons. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4019.04s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just trying to think reasonably move it is, I guess, what I was getting at. But okay, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4022.3199999999997s)]
*  I think you have it, folks. A good debate here on the all-in. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4026.3999999999996s)]
*  A good debate. I still love you all. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4029.2799999999997s)]
*  We'll lay copper from some country that has an SMR all the way to Washington State. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4032.96s)]
*  I was just thinking, if Canada and Mexico have economic incentive to do this, or they're more [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4040.48s)]

*  If you're Kairos, and you can't put this in the United States, but you could put it in Mexico, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4053.12s)]
*  and then come up with a way to get it past Trump's border wall. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4057.92s)]
*  You may be able to put it into the United States, but we won't know until we know it works. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4061.52s)]
*  I'm sorry, I keep going back to this tricky little issue of it doesn't work. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4067.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think, Freiburg, I'm with you. Even with the disasters that have happened, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4071.92s)]
*  those are with Gen 1 and Gen 2 reactors. There hasn't been one in a long time. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4076.48s)]
*  I believe those significantly. If we could spin those up right now, these Gen 2, Gen 3 reactors, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4081.76s)]
*  do them all day long. I think that they're very safe. They're very reliable. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4085.6s)]
*  The 3s are what we should be rolling out everywhere. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4088.0s)]
*  I would be fine with one being 100 miles from my backyard. No problem. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4089.92s)]
*  100. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4093.6s)]
*  It's 4 that's producing... China is producing a gigawatt of power. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4094.08s)]
*  Would you want one 10 miles outside Austin? [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4097.2s)]
*  I don't think you should put it 10 miles outside of any city. I know that they're doing that in [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4100.16s)]
*  India. They're doing that in China. I would think, you know, if you look up the footprint [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4103.36s)]
*  of Fukushima, I mean, that was a complete disaster. They put that below sea level. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4108.4s)]
*  They told them not to put it there. And they put it near a bunch of people who [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4112.08s)]
*  were living within miles of it, single digit miles of it. There's no reason for this to be [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4116.32s)]
*  any closer than 50 or 100 miles. And I would be totally fine with it being 50 to 100 miles from [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4121.679999999999s)]

*  No, but 50 miles or 100 miles to be anywhere. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4140.0s)]
*  Far away from where we use them and everyone will be safe. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4142.32s)]
*  Would you be comfortable with putting them in the desert? [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4144.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but in that case, there won't be... [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4147.04s)]
*  Okay, then we're done. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4148.48s)]
*  That's how we're running wind and geothermal today. We're putting these sites in random places [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4149.759999999999s)]
*  and solar. And then we're running cable and we're producing power and delivering it to... [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4154.08s)]
*  Just because they don't want it to be an eyesore, right? That's why we're doing that with solar, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4158.96s)]
*  is we don't want people to look at a giant solar thing. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4162.16s)]
*  Solar, right. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4164.88s)]
*  Like I said, I'm not against doing it if you can find a community that's willing to do it. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4165.44s)]
*  And if you put it where there's no humans, then yeah, that's going to work. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4169.36s)]
*  So there we go. We've resolved our issue. We got the compromise here. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4172.32s)]
*  Here we are in the lolling pod solving world problems. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4175.6s)]

*  Any progress, Sachs is not interested in any progress. Okay? If we can go back to the 50s, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4201.76s)]
*  that's what he wants. Let's get some coal. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4206.32s)]

*  Yes. It's a luxury belief. You're promoting something. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4212.0s)]
*  Nuclear power is a luxury belief. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4214.8s)]
*  You heard it here first. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4216.96s)]

*  No, they're not. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4220.4s)]

*  Everything is not identity politics. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4223.44s)]

*  Sachs, let me ask you a serious question. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4270.4s)]
*  It's not serious when you start like that. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4274.96s)]
*  If Trump loses, what's the next four years on this pod going to be like? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4277.52s)]

*  There's going to be lawfare all over the place. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4286.64s)]
*  Absolutely. They're going to come for you. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4288.72s)]
*  Do you really think so, David? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4290.32s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4291.52s)]

*  Elon's at the top of the list, right? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4296.0s)]
*  He has no choice but to go all in. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4298.64s)]
*  They're already doing lawfare against him. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4300.64s)]
*  I think the point is just that if they're not defeated, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4303.200000000001s)]
*  they're going to keep doing it because there's no downside for it. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4307.200000000001s)]
*  I will comment on the California Coastal Commission ruling that was based on Elon's [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4312.0s)]
*  political tweets, which is why they stopped additional launches out of Vandenberg. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4316.56s)]
*  What? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4320.240000000001s)]
*  First of all, how the California Coastal Commission has authority over Vandenberg [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4320.72s)]
*  and the operations just seems to me like there's something wrong. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4326.32s)]
*  The Coastal Commission was set up with the Coastal Act in 1976 in California [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4329.84s)]
*  as a way to give the beaches back to the people and the public and create a commission to regulate [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4334.4s)]
*  building along the beaches. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4338.719999999999s)]
*  It has since grown into effectively a much larger entity with much more authority, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4340.16s)]
*  which potentially after the Chevron ruling in the Supreme Court [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4347.04s)]
*  may get peeled back and may get dialed down. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4350.88s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4353.5199999999995s)]
*  But as of now, they have the ability to block launches out of Vandenberg, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4354.4s)]
*  which they did. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4357.92s)]
*  And in their decision, they said it was because of Elon's political tweets. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4358.719999999999s)]
*  Again, starting at the beginning of the show about the success that they had [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4362.4s)]
*  with the Starship this week, it's incredible. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4365.92s)]
*  It deserves to be recognized on the merits of what they accomplished. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4368.16s)]
*  But to bring in his political tweets to make a decision about the progress of SpaceX and allow [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4371.36s)]
*  public space to be used to further that cause and further that activity [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4375.92s)]
*  seems to me abhorrent and it's ridiculous. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4380.799999999999s)]
*  And it's exactly what's wrong with the bureaucratic morass [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4383.28s)]
*  that a lot of these institutions have grown into. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4386.48s)]

*  Do you think they're going to be pro or con? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4390.32s)]

*  SMRs. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4394.5599999999995s)]

*  Yeah. No, I'm serious. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4397.04s)]
*  Do you think they're going to be con for sure? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4398.48s)]
*  They're con every time. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4400.4s)]
*  The Coastal Commission? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4401.2s)]
*  What the Coastal Commission does is they block everything and they do [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4401.92s)]
*  pictures of the entire coastline. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4406.96s)]
*  If you build like a shed on your beachfront property, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4408.4s)]
*  they will know it and they come to you and they're like, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4412.080000000001s)]
*  no sheds, you cannot build any structures on the beach. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4414.56s)]
*  They're just like really, really hard core. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4417.52s)]
*  It's a values decision that the state of California made in 1976. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4419.68s)]
*  The state of California, the citizens voted and said, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4423.120000000001s)]
*  we want to preserve the coastline. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4426.080000000001s)]
*  And I think that that's a reasonable value for them to assume and vote for. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4428.160000000001s)]
*  And it was a majority vote. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4431.84s)]
*  And so they established the Coastal Commission. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4433.360000000001s)]
*  But how the Coastal Commission extended into having authority over Vandenberg [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4435.360000000001s)]
*  and launches from there for SpaceX to me is part of this kind of administrative growth. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4439.36s)]
*  We see all these administrative bureaucracies get started that have a very simple objective, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4444.48s)]
*  preserve the California coastline. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4448.4s)]
*  But now they have authority to determine whether or not launches can happen. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4450.08s)]
*  And this is one person at the Coastal Commission referenced his tweets. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4453.679999999999s)]
*  And the vote was six, four to increase these. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4459.759999999999s)]
*  So who is this one person? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4462.4s)]
*  She did it in an official context. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4463.759999999999s)]
*  I think she was like retweeting it. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4465.679999999999s)]
*  There's like a tweet from her. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4467.04s)]
*  Yeah, this is what I'm doing. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4468.24s)]
*  I'm taking credit for it. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4469.44s)]
*  I mean, in a way, she's proud of it. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4470.719999999999s)]
*  She said the quiet part out loud. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4473.599999999999s)]
*  So in a way, she does a favor, which is she acknowledged that all of this lawfare [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4475.44s)]
*  against SpaceX and Elon is political. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4480.32s)]
*  She basically pleaded guilty to it. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4483.04s)]
*  Look, she's proud of it because she doesn't think there's anything wrong with it. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4484.8s)]
*  She thinks this is her job is as a bureaucrat, she's supposed to punish people [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4487.76s)]
*  who tweet things that you're not supposed to say. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4491.599999999999s)]
*  That basically is what it comes down to. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4494.0s)]
*  And I mean, this is the truth about lawfare. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4496.240000000001s)]
*  They're using the agencies of the federal government to exact reprisals [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4498.72s)]
*  against their political opponents. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4503.92s)]
*  And if there's not a punishment for that, it's going to keep going. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4505.84s)]
*  And they filed a, Elon's filed a lawsuit and it's a six-word decision. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4509.92s)]
*  So I think there's- [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4515.360000000001s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration could stop that. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4516.64s)]
*  They could say no more lawfare, but they don't do that because the tone was set from the top. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4518.72s)]
*  And Trump is saying he's going to be a dictator and he's going to do a bunch of lawfare when he [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4523.92s)]
*  gets in there. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4527.52s)]
*  So both of these sides got to settle it down. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4528.0s)]
*  That's exactly what he said. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4530.32s)]
*  This has been another amazing- [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4531.68s)]
*  No, that's another misquote. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4532.8s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4534.08s)]
*  Jay, you can't wrap a show like that. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4534.32s)]
*  That's just not cool. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4535.84s)]
*  I'm just trying to wrap up so we can move on. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4536.4s)]
*  Well, then don't make a slight comment. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4538.08s)]
*  Just do something else. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4540.08s)]
*  Talk about something else besides Trump at the end. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4540.96s)]
*  Just give him my opinion. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4543.36s)]
*  I'm not allowed to give my opinion on the show. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4544.24s)]
*  What are you grateful for right now in your life? [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4545.52s)]
*  I'm grateful for you doing all the work on the events and making them spectacular. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4548.0s)]

*  I will totally go to Mar-a-Lago for election night. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4556.88s)]
*  Can we get a booth there? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye012kzWJ3A&t=4559.04s)]
