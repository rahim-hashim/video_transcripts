# IPOs and SPACs are Back, Mag 7 Showdown, Zuck on Tilt, Apple's Fumble, GENIUS Act passes Senate

*  How are you feeling? You're tired and grumpy, aren't you? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=52.72s)]

*  Easy transition for me. I didn't have to do the work. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=55.28s)]

*  How's Shmekel? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=68.88s)]
*  Magnificent. Magnificent. Thank you for asking. Thank you for asking that. Yeah. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=70.32s)]
*  Okay, let's move on. Thank you. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=74.64s)]
*  Thank you for all the coverage. And just we sent over a gift basket to Moth and I longhorn [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  Poconya steaks, a 10 year membership for. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=82.56s)]
*  Oh, hey, congrats to Olivia Landon, by the way, of Longhill Wagyu. She had twins. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=87.44s)]
*  That means she's going to have more people to work on the ranch and slaughter cattle to send us our [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=93.44s)]
*  Poconya. Congratulations. Shout out to Olivia Landon. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=97.44s)]
*  It's so funny because we love this. We love these steaks so much. She doubled. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=100.72s)]
*  We mentioned it on the pod. You idiots started like searching for it lunatics and they ordered [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=105.92s)]
*  out all the cool at stake. So now, Chumoth and I are screwed. No, no, they ordered out everything. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=110.24s)]
*  Everything was sold out. Everything was sold out. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=115.52s)]
*  So now we have to gatekeep with us again, your chairman dictator, Chumoth Pollyhapitiya. He [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=118.0s)]
*  have two votes in our fine organization. How you doing Chumoth? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=123.75999999999999s)]
*  I love voting control. I'm doing great. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=128.64s)]
*  He starts Thomas Lafont with a tie and then all of the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=131.04s)]
*  gamesmanship happens between the team of rivals, me and Freyberg with us again, Thomas Lafont, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=136.16000000000003s)]
*  a gentleman, a scholar, no idea why he's here, a true, I don't know how he wound up on this pocket, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=142.72000000000003s)]
*  but a true gentleman, a true scholar and host of Easts Meets West, an incredible conference [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=148.88000000000002s)]
*  that I attended this week with our bestie, David Sacks, who of course is at the White House and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  can't join us. But Thomas, what a great event. Thank you for including me. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=162.24s)]
*  No box lunches, by the way, we took your feedback from a couple of years ago. So [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  I hope that we met your standard. What were the highlights for you guys at your conference, Thomas? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=172.4s)]
*  I mean, I think for me, obviously, I think a lot of news in AI this week. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  So I think that was kind of the center piece of most of the panels, pretty much up and down the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  stack from SaaS companies trying to transform into AI to obviously the big Zuck news on scale. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=187.76s)]
*  And then potentially I saw in the information today, the Nat Friedman news. So it feels like [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=194.64s)]
*  there's a lot going on in the industry. So it should be fun to talk about. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=199.76s)]
*  Yeah. And we're going to talk about it all today. We got a really full docket. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  Rick Caruso, the mayor who would have saved Los Angeles from the fires. He was there and you [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  actually hosted at his incredible facility. What we did, we talked about the state of LA, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=213.52s)]
*  which Jake, how is that? Is that it looks like that's where you're at, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  Yes, I'm at my LA home, which [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  Okay, the compound. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=226.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's available on Airbnb. So I'm here in LA. But yeah, Rick Caruso. What a great speaker. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=228.72s)]
*  Interestingly, Jake out today, a friend just sent me a chart showing the recovery of restaurants [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=234.72s)]
*  post COVID. And fifth, LA is 50% behind on the recovery per store location versus the national [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=239.92s)]
*  average. What do you attribute that to? Or what did they attribute it to? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  I think I think there's kind of a couple different things, right? I think one, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=253.44s)]
*  the economy, which, you know, unlike the San Francisco economy being levered to AI and on [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=258.24s)]
*  the upswing is more levered to entertainment. And I think, you know, secular decline, I think, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=263.52s)]
*  you know, someone mentioned at the conference that filmings in LA are down 50% from peak. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=270.56s)]
*  So I mean, that's just a massive move down, losing share to other geos, both in the US, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  I think Georgia, right? J Cal was mentioned in another [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  explained exactly how aggressive New York is being the UK is being Atlanta. I mean, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=286.64s)]
*  so many different hubs for movies giving much better deals than Los Angeles is. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=292.64s)]
*  Yeah. So I think it's a combination of, I think, you know, being levered to one industry that's [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  kind of in secular decline. I can tell you from Mr. Beast that for beast games, we had a deal [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=304.8s)]
*  in Las Vegas and in Toronto, we got huge tax credits. And in the second season, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=310.32s)]
*  that we're doing for Amazon, we did an enormous deal with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And so [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=315.76s)]
*  we're filming a bunch of episodes there. We're building the sets there. We're actually going [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  to keep them there after it's all said and done. We would not film in Los Angeles, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=325.84s)]
*  unless we absolutely had to, we will stay as far away from California as possible. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=331.67999999999995s)]
*  And regulations are such a big part of this. It's on economic, you can't make it work. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=335.84s)]
*  Yeah, 30% more expensive, I think it's is the kind of the official number on [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=340.08s)]
*  what speed right Thomas, how quickly can you stand something up? How many, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=344.79999999999995s)]
*  how much paperwork you have to file? James Beard Foundation, I'm seeing here from the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=349.84s)]
*  research has found that all these independent restaurant owners said they just can't get staff [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=354.32s)]
*  here. So in Los Angeles, it's just hard for people to live here. And it's hard to get through the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=358.71999999999997s)]
*  regulations. And if you make it hard, there are other options for people. This idea that California [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=363.52s)]
*  has a lock on anything other than incredible weather and beautiful people is far so calm. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=368.32s)]
*  There's a lot of beautiful people in other places with decent weather and you can go to your [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=374.08s)]
*  projections there. So another topic that came up that a lot of people were talking about, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=378.48s)]
*  something that I know you've talked a lot about our debt issue and the debt to GDP ratio. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=383.68s)]
*  There was a lot of talk on the on the flip side on the GDP side. What if actually AI can increase [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=390.64000000000004s)]
*  productivity and regrow GDP faster than expectations? Right. And perhaps that's one [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  of the reasons why interest rates might not be quite as high as you might expect given some of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=403.44s)]
*  the trends that you guys have talked about. So I think a lot of a lot of discussions around [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=409.04s)]
*  AI productivity and what we could look at over the next five to 10 years because of the [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=415.44s)]
*  improvements we're seeing. This is particularly beneficial to the US, right? I mean, if you think [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=420.56s)]
*  about where AI is going to accrue economic surplus first, it's likely going to be in the US, not [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=426.88s)]
*  global GDP. So the US kind of does it compete away dollars or it increases overall productivity or [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=433.2s)]
*  both ahead of the rest of the world? If we do see advances from AI to accelerate GDP growth, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=438.88s)]
*  is that because of all of the on-shoring of manufacturing and industry that we outsource [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=445.84s)]
*  today? Like, do you think that that goes hand in hand with AI acceleration? I think that's part of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=452.08s)]
*  it. And I think the other part is just getting even out of the, you know, the knowledge worker [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=458.64s)]
*  workforce, right? Just getting significant productivity improvements there. One of the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=464.32s)]
*  things that we showed in our keynote is the adoption of these technologies and even taking [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=470.15999999999997s)]
*  doctors as an example, right? An area you know well, you know, this new company kind of coming [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  in and developing kind of a diagnosis kind of engine, right? That's now used by a third of [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=483.6s)]
*  doctors. So, you know, I think that it's open evidence, by the way, is the name of the company [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=491.12s)]
*  and already a third of US physicians are on the platform using it, you know, 10 times a day to [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=498.8s)]
*  kind of help diagnoses. So in particular in oncology as an example, it's seen significant [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=503.92s)]
*  traction. So, you know, you multiply that by the legal profession, coding, I think we're already [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=508.8s)]
*  seeing, you know, what if we just see kind of an explosion of productivity gains across, you know, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=514.72s)]
*  both the physical and the digital economy? Yeah, the doctor wants a good example. If someone had [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=519.84s)]
*  the opportunity to go get more regular preventative checkups, they would. The problem is it's very [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=525.12s)]
*  expensive. It's hard to get an appointment or insurance won't cover it. But if the cost to a [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=531.6s)]
*  doctor goes down because they can leverage AI, the throughput goes up by 10x, they can see 10 [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=537.04s)]
*  times as many patients per day, then suddenly diagnostic care becomes more available. They [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=542.4s)]
*  can charge for that. They don't need to charge the same amount. The price will come down per checkup, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=548.0s)]
*  but you'll more people will be able to get a checkup per day. So that grows GDP in diagnostic care [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=552.56s)]
*  that grows the size of that piece of the economy. It's a very good example. I'll give you by the way, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=558.16s)]
*  anything where AI provides leverage to a service provider where their throughput now goes up. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=563.12s)]
*  I'll give you another example of that, Dave. So there was an LA dentist that kind of hit [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=568.24s)]
*  God viral this week. I don't know if you guys saw this story. But basically, he created an ad [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=574.48s)]
*  using VO three about a skydiving gorilla who, you know, ultimately needs to get his teeth fixed [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=581.44s)]
*  because he was drinking while he was jumping out of the plane. And you know, it's a very kind of [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=588.48s)]
*  funny viral ad. He probably made it for a couple, you know, 100 bucks. And now his practice is [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=592.4s)]
*  totally full. He's been flooded with requests, right for the new dental implants. So, you know, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=598.64s)]
*  to your point about increasing productivity, boom, there's how VO three can help a local dentist. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=604.64s)]
*  All right, everybody. Welcome to the number one podcast in the world. We got a full docket, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=610.24s)]
*  full docket, but we're going to rocket the docket because there's so much going on here. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=615.52s)]
*  Zuck is tilted clearly. This has been the big discussion in Silicon Valley [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=620.0s)]
*  for the last 10 days or so, according to reports, Zuck is super frustrated that META is falling [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=625.36s)]
*  behind in AI. So he is swinging for the fences. Sam Altman said META has offered top open AI [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=631.68s)]
*  employees a $100 million. Wait for it. Signing bonus. That's not comp. That's a signing bonus. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=638.24s)]
*  Who knows if this is true or not. But he's also offering 100 million a year an annual comp. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=644.24s)]
*  He's clearly cut out tens of billions of dollars for this effort, not dissimilar to when he did [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=649.36s)]
*  his VR efforts that didn't work out so well. Here's a 30 second clip of Sam Altman talking [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=654.48s)]
*  about this on his brother Jack's podcast Uncapped. They started making these like giant offers to, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=659.92s)]
*  uh, you know, a lot of people on our team, you know, like $109 signing bonuses, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  more than that comp per year is crazy. And I'm actually, it is crazy. I'm really happy that at [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=670.88s)]
*  least so far, uh, none of our best people have decided to take them up on that. I think that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=676.32s)]
*  people sort of look at the two paths and say, all right, open eyes got a really good shot, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=681.6s)]
*  a much better shot at actually delivering on super intelligence. Uh, and also may eventually be the [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=685.9200000000001s)]
*  more valuable company. META just also vested over 14 billion. I'm using invested in quotes [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=690.5600000000001s)]
*  in scale AI for 49% stake. And, uh, this probably is better described as a shadow aqua hire to get [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=696.32s)]
*  around antitrust scrutiny. You remember Microsoft did that with inflection AI back in the day. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=702.72s)]
*  Google did it with character AI and Amazon did it with the depth AI. I'm not sure if this is [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=707.28s)]
*  necessary anymore. Uh, since Lena cons no longer in the position scale CEO, Alexander Wang and [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=711.6800000000001s)]
*  others will be joining META to work on a new super intelligence team. They're saying that [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=716.5600000000001s)]
*  scale is going to remain an independent company and get a new CEO. I'm not sure if that's going [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=721.0400000000001s)]
*  to happen. And if you don't know, uh, scale does data labeling. They get experts to help train [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=724.1600000000001s)]
*  language models. Two of their biggest customers are open AI and Google, and they both canceled [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=731.84s)]
*  their contracts. So Zuck is taking that chess piece off the board so he can get all that data [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=736.88s)]
*  into his LLMs. He's also reportedly in talks to hire former GitHub CEO, Nat Friedman and Daniel [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=742.24s)]
*  Gross to work on AI. They have a incubator investment fund for AI. Daniel Gross had a [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=748.0s)]
*  really cool startup incubator called pioneer labs. I had them on this week and startups a couple [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=754.88s)]
*  years ago. Really smart cat. Meta has 70 billion in cash. Thomas Lafont, when you see Zuck doing [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=759.44s)]
*  this, what's your take not only on what Zucks doing, but how big of an opportunity is this, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=766.5600000000001s)]
*  you know, in terms of the prize of having the best large language model, what is he going for here? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=773.12s)]
*  And what's your take on these really aggressive packages and 49% purchases? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=779.7600000000001s)]
*  I mean, look, I think one, it, it feels highly rational, right? If you think about Meta's market [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=785.44s)]
*  cap is a rough math, 1.7 trillion. If you're the CEO and you ultimately believe that maybe 50% [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=791.36s)]
*  of your market cap is at risk because of AI, 850 billion. Why would you not spend maybe four or five [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=798.08s)]
*  percent of that? If you think it increases the odds even slightly that you're going to win the market. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  So to me, it kind of reminded me of a few, few things. Number one, the scale and size of the [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=811.52s)]
*  opportunity, right? Obviously people think AI is massive, but frankly, Jake, I'm even wondering, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=818.8s)]
*  putting the regulatory scrutiny to the side, if it was time, he just didn't want to wait. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=824.72s)]
*  And obviously doing it this way, I think Alex literally the next day, who's the CEO of scale, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=829.04s)]
*  can show up to work at Meta. So I think it's, it's urgency of a large opportunity. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=833.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm curious to get your most take because it reminded me a little bit of the pivot away from [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=839.04s)]
*  HTML five and also a much smaller acquisition, but one that we really felt, which was of a company [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=842.7199999999999s)]
*  called Onavo. And for those that may not remember, Onavo was a small data service provider, but what [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=849.12s)]
*  it did is it had a panel of phones and we as investors could see what people, which apps [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=855.04s)]
*  people were using. And the data was incredibly valuable because it was the only service that [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=861.4399999999999s)]
*  gave you true engagement data. And so obviously as an investor, you felt, wow, this is an incredible [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=866.6400000000001s)]
*  tool. And eventually it sold to Facebook and Facebook used it internally and didn't allow [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=871.6800000000001s)]
*  anybody else to use it. And we lost one of our key abilities, right? In the mobile app revolution to [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=878.24s)]
*  tell who was winning and losing. So, um, and you're saying the scale acquisition is, you know, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=884.6400000000001s)]
*  parallels that in a bit. This is great service. A lot of people rely on it. He buys it, he buys [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=890.48s)]
*  it, shuts it down for everybody else, gets the tool for himself, gets the data for himself. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=896.4000000000001s)]
*  Correct. So I definitely see parallels. And I think given this, you know, their market cap [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=900.0s)]
*  and the size of this opportunity, I think it makes a lot of sense. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=904.0s)]
*  Shamath, your thoughts on Zuck's action. Obviously folks know you worked with him as [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=908.5600000000001s)]
*  you went from tens of millions of Facebook users to hundreds of millions. And you were there [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=913.12s)]
*  actually during the HTML wrapper app disaster that I think maybe that was a debate at our [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=917.84s)]
*  executive team, at our M team. And I was on the side of apps and well, without embarrassing him, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  somebody else was on the side of HTML five. I thought it was stupid. Why, why, why was that? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=932.24s)]
*  But that decision won because, you know, all of my political capital at the time was also wrapped [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=937.52s)]
*  into native apps, our own phone, an entire verticalized integrated stack. And politically, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=943.28s)]
*  I think I made the decision for them very hard because I was not a very [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=952.56s)]
*  plain ice in the sandbox with others kind of executive. I was more of a scorched earth, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=957.6s)]
*  get it done kind of person. Okay. So no changes over the last 15 years. That's good to know. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=961.68s)]
*  They made it, they made an enormous mistake, but then they admitted it about a year after I left. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=966.3199999999999s)]
*  They said this was the single sucks. Explain in plain English why HTML five wrappers versus [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=970.4s)]
*  native app. I can't cause it's retarded. Okay, great. I can explain it. So like native apps are [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=975.6s)]
*  was obvious in 2010. And the only, the only reason to use HTML was as an end around for different [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=982.72s)]
*  carriers and for different ecosystems that were trying to charge us a toll. So in 2010, I went [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=992.72s)]
*  to mobile world Congress and I took a group of my most talented developers and we built an entire [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=999.52s)]
*  replica of Facebook that we call Facebook zero, which was only available via URL. And we launched [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1006.48s)]
*  it at mobile world Congress and we did it. And I announced it there because if you went to India, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  as an example, all of the folks there would try to charge us a tax. But if you could navigate [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1017.52s)]
*  through the browser, you wouldn't have to pay it. Right. So that was a good example of what to do [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1024.4s)]
*  in a developing market when people were toll taking. But the real solution was to build an [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1028.96s)]
*  extremely integrated app from the software all the way to the hardware. And the only way to do that [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1033.52s)]
*  was as a native application. And that has tremendous applications to today. But just to finish on [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1039.1200000000001s)]
*  yesterday, my proposition was full phone, full stack, full app, all of this other HTML stuff [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1044.32s)]
*  should only be as a side thing that we do in markets where they try to make it difficult for [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1050.64s)]
*  us. Instead, it became politicized. And it became a big bet on HTML five, which I thought was [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1055.44s)]
*  absolutely stupid and unjustifiable. And that was also when I said, Okay, well, this phone's not [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1060.4s)]
*  going to happen. So let me leave. And a year later, I think Mark, to his credit said this was really [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1066.0800000000002s)]
*  stupid and ripped all the HTML five stuff apart, went native and the rest is history. So let's fast [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1071.04s)]
*  forward to today. Yeah, there it is. biggest mistake was betting too much. It was it was an [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1076.0s)]
*  and that was again, I'll just say it. People politicizing what should have been an obvious [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1081.6799999999998s)]
*  technical decision. Okay, let's see. Other piece of that just to add to it was it was also a [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1087.12s)]
*  religious decision and people like it was open standards of HTML five, certain developers who [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1091.6799999999998s)]
*  felt like we have to support open standards, stupid people thought that only stupid non technical [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1097.36s)]
*  people thought that it was stupid. It was obvious. You'd have to be a moron. And there were morons at [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1101.9199999999998s)]
*  the executive team that advocated for this. Anyways, we were right, they were wrong. And [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1108.48s)]
*  he was fine. Okay, fast forward to the where are we today? It's the exact same story playing out. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1113.44s)]
*  Now, what do I mean? You have to look very carefully at Microsoft's deal with open AI. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1118.8s)]
*  Why? Because what you see is the compounding of secrets. There are secrets in the training layer. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1124.16s)]
*  There are secrets in the model layer. There are secrets in how these things are tightly coupled [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1132.24s)]
*  to infrastructure and compute. And what we have to remember is what open AI got from Microsoft [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1136.72s)]
*  was an extremely competent partner that built an enormous Azure compute infrastructure to train [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1144.08s)]
*  everything from chat GPT, all the way up to the O3 model, Dali, everything. Why is that important? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1151.3600000000001s)]
*  Because you start to figure out these tricks. How do you really optimize these models to be extremely [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1158.96s)]
*  performant? Now, if you look at all of the other models, they've also had some level of that [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1165.6s)]
*  advantage. So if you look at deep seat, what did they do? Well, we don't know. But what we have been [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1171.6799999999998s)]
*  told is that there's very tight coupling to hardware. If you look at what XAI is doing, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1176.6399999999999s)]
*  I think what you can bet is that there's an extremely tight coupling to hardware and [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1182.56s)]
*  infrastructure and compute. If you look at what Facebook is doing, they generically train on [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1186.8s)]
*  Nvidia and they launch it in the open source. So I think that what they need to do is more of the [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1192.96s)]
*  open AI, more of the Google playbook. Look at Google. Google's Gemini models are extremely [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1200.16s)]
*  tightly coupled to TPU. And it enables and unlocks an entire stack of secrets and capability [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1206.56s)]
*  that then get manifested in model quality. So I think the first thing that Mark has to do, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1214.08s)]
*  if I were him, is start to chip away at all of the sets of secrets. So what secrets do you get [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1218.88s)]
*  from Alexander Wang and scale? It's what are the labeling techniques that allow these models to be [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1226.24s)]
*  more and more performant? What labeling techniques are used in the reasoning models? What labeling [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1233.2s)]
*  techniques are used in more traditional LLMs? It is clear that Lama doesn't know this. Meta doesn't [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1238.0s)]
*  know this that well because their model quality is men. So now what you get is that set of secrets. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1243.4399999999998s)]
*  So what do you get from Nat Freeman and Daniel Gross? You get what are the apps doing? How are [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1249.1999999999998s)]
*  they approaching writing agents? These agentic tips and tricks that make usability and value more [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1253.04s)]
*  obvious. But then what's missing? I think the thing that's missing is the infrastructure and compute [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1258.4799999999998s)]
*  set of secrets. I think it's insufficient to buy stuff off the shelf from Nvidia and expect these [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1264.7199999999998s)]
*  models to fundamentally compete. So I think if I were a betting man, he's bought the training [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1271.12s)]
*  secrets, he's bought the app secrets, and now he has to buy some infrastructure and compute [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1276.4799999999998s)]
*  hardware secrets. You put it together and he's got a pretty good strategy here. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1280.6399999999999s)]
*  And also, just to add to that, Shamath, Nat and Daniel have invested in a lot of AI companies [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1284.08s)]
*  and those companies have secrets of their own. Yeah, those are the apps. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1290.2399999999998s)]
*  Actually, I think they have some along the full stack. Freeberg, your thoughts on this strategy [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1294.56s)]
*  as described by Thomas and Shamath and just the data we're seeing on the playing field, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1299.28s)]
*  aggressive acquisition of talent and companies. I don't know if I have much to add here. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1304.6399999999999s)]
*  Okay, one additional point, Shamath, by the way that you mentioned, if we look at the winners, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1311.12s)]
*  right in models of the past 12 months, Anthropic the same, right? They've been very kind of deliberate [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1314.8799999999999s)]
*  and have explained how TPUs, right, they've been a big user of them, how it's helped define their [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1321.36s)]
*  training models. So I think you're 100% right. If we look at the models that have really performed, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1326.56s)]
*  it's ones that have that that quote secret, as you mentioned. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1331.04s)]
*  When I first started 8090 a year ago, one of the key bets I made, which was a mistake, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1334.24s)]
*  and we unwound the bet. But the first bet that I made was, can we build a transpiler, which is to [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1339.76s)]
*  say, can you take a CUDA workload? And then can you redirect it away from Nvidia to different [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1345.52s)]
*  hardware? And basically, what I learned in that process are all of the attention mechanisms that [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1350.8799999999999s)]
*  are built into transformers that really differentiate how good the models are, need to literally be [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1356.16s)]
*  hand tuned for every single target of silicon that you have. So when Amazon just kind of wakes up and [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1364.8000000000002s)]
*  says, here's this chip, it means nothing unless you can incentivize somebody to build to it. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1371.2s)]
*  But the opposite is also true. If you have a model, and you just run it generically, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1376.64s)]
*  you're not going to get the gains and it's not going to be as special as if you have a dedicated [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1380.88s)]
*  infrastructure and compute architecture and say we're going to tightly couple these. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1385.84s)]
*  It's been clear that OpenAI has had that. Anthropic has had that. Google has had that. DeepSeq has [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1389.6799999999998s)]
*  had that. And I think Meta needs to do that. Otherwise, they're always going to be floundering [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1397.1999999999998s)]
*  on their back heel. One quick misnomer, I think, you know, when people hear labeling, they kind of [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1401.28s)]
*  assume a photo of a dog and someone says this is a dog, right? I mean, that's definitely how it started. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1406.0s)]
*  But if you look at sales business, it's completely more from that. So you could actually [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1411.12s)]
*  label a problem. So for example, in simple terms, two plus two equals four is actually [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1416.32s)]
*  a reasoning data set, right? So you got to think of labeling not just in the simple terms of, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1422.4799999999998s)]
*  you know, this image, but of massive data sets of outcomes. And that's what's kind of really used [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1427.76s)]
*  to train these reasoning models. But I think there's another story here, guys, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1433.76s)]
*  in my opinion. And it's the performance of the Mac 7, right? And I'm going to have to check with [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1440.88s)]
*  my data science team. But I'm wondering if we're this is the year where we've seen the greatest [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1449.1200000000001s)]
*  divergence amongst the Mac 7, right? So if you look at the Mac 7, and if I just gave you [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1453.1200000000001s)]
*  right this performance, you can see okay, so Meta is up 18, Google's down, NVIDIA's [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1460.48s)]
*  up eight, Tesla down 20, Apple down 21, Amazon down three and Microsoft is plus 13. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1465.44s)]
*  Right? So it's kind of interesting in a market that, you know, historically over the past few [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1472.6399999999999s)]
*  years, where we feel the Mac 7 have been truly correlated. Now, the market is saying, wait, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1478.1599999999999s)]
*  hold on, we might start to see diverging performance. What I read from that in one element [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1483.36s)]
*  is the market starting to try and sort out who are going to be the winners and losers who's well [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1489.44s)]
*  positioned versus maybe falling behind. Right? So I think we're going to start to see some [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1494.4s)]
*  divergent performance from the Mac 7. I think it's going to reward not. Yeah, put that back [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1499.92s)]
*  up there for a second. I mean, I think that's so interesting. Because if you look at the conditions [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1504.24s)]
*  on the field today, you know, Google's down 8%. But again, I would tell you, as a user, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1508.3200000000002s)]
*  Gemini models are exceptional. Like absolutely just bar none exceptional. I think Anthropic is [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1515.3600000000001s)]
*  incredible for CodeGen. Incredible. What I see is every single company on this list that isn't NVIDIA [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1525.1200000000001s)]
*  baking and rolling their own silicon. Yet NVIDIA is up and the rest are down. I told you that I [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1535.44s)]
*  spent time last week at Tesla, I would not be sleeping on this business. I think that it is [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1542.96s)]
*  yet again back into the land of being misunderstood. The only one that I understand why it's down [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1548.0s)]
*  this much is Apple. Because it's not clear that they're even baking something in private, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1554.3200000000002s)]
*  there's nothing public, there's nothing private, it just seems like they're transitioning into [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1559.2s)]
*  being a cash cow, and getting into sort of that cash harvesting mode. But it's almost weird that [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1562.72s)]
*  the price action is what it is, because I would have thought that Google would be the winner. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1568.16s)]
*  Google would be up, Meta would maybe be a little flattish to down, NVIDIA is up, but maybe it could [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1572.24s)]
*  be down, Tesla is down, but it should probably be up. Amazon's basically break even and Apple is [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1577.52s)]
*  down. And I think that kind of makes sense. That's sort of how I read this table. Yeah, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1582.72s)]
*  I mean, look, what I love Chamath, by the way, on that is that like now there's debates, right? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1586.0800000000002s)]
*  And you can argue whether you know, you agree with Chamath or whether you don't, by the way. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1591.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, Zuck's not spending 20 billion because he's not afraid. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1595.6000000000001s)]
*  Correct. Yeah, I know. Let's pull the chart up again here. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1598.5600000000002s)]
*  An interesting way to discuss each of these companies. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1602.16s)]
*  The only reason Microsoft is not on this list is because of the limitation of the [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1606.0800000000002s)]
*  DOS era interface of the Bloomberg terminal, where it will only allow you to compare six [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1611.1200000000001s)]
*  charts and not seven. But we know that Microsoft is up 13. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1615.6000000000001s)]
*  Two perplexity. Yeah. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1619.1200000000001s)]
*  So, you know, also when you look at these, there are some extenuating circumstances here, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1621.52s)]
*  like Tesla's car sales are down, all car sales are down. And I think that's the piece that maybe [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1627.3600000000001s)]
*  isn't being accounted for here. And they're in a transitional period. Apple obviously. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1631.68s)]
*  There's also. Yeah, there's a lot of regulatory overhead. So Tesla losing [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1635.92s)]
*  solar and EV tax credits. Yes. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1641.44s)]
*  Apple being told to onshore and stop buying from China. So their supply chain's being disrupted [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1643.68s)]
*  because of tariffs. Those two companies in particular are far more affected than the rest. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1648.48s)]
*  And even Amazon, you know, there's been some conversation about tariff effect on Amazon, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1654.48s)]
*  but obviously that's offset with some of the benefits they've been realizing and promoting [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1659.92s)]
*  as Jassy spoke in his letter this week from AI. So I think that there's a variation here [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1663.68s)]
*  that's probably a little bit more Thomas kind of tuned to these conditions that aren't necessarily [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1669.3600000000001s)]
*  call it natural market forces, but are kind of influenced market forces associated with the new [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1676.64s)]
*  administration and some of the policy choices that are being made. If we were looking at those [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1681.6000000000001s)]
*  number one and number two, which one do you think gets to AGI first? Thomas? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1686.88s)]
*  Well, hold on, by the way, the other thing you should note, Jason, which I find really interesting [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1691.0400000000002s)]
*  is nobody's talks about AGI anymore. If you listen to the language of all the companies, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1695.1200000000001s)]
*  it's all super intelligence, which is a much more achievable goal because it's defined as being, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1699.28s)]
*  you know, multiples more intelligent than a human being. But I think you're, I think if you actually [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1704.16s)]
*  did a search for the number of times AGI is being said today, it's meaningfully less because I think [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1709.52s)]
*  people have realized that that's not in the offing. Yeah. By the way, another lens, Chamath, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1715.28s)]
*  that I think about on these is who controls their own destiny of these seven companies in AI. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1719.28s)]
*  Right. And I would argue Tesla does, Nvidia, and then it's kind of interesting, right? Neither [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1724.8s)]
*  Amazon doesn't have its own foundation model, right? They're kind of dependent on others, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1733.12s)]
*  right? Microsoft 49% does, right? Because of this kind of relationship they have with open AI [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1736.96s)]
*  it's both, you know, they own a big share, but they don't control it. So there's kind of interesting [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1745.2s)]
*  and then maybe six months ago we would have said, well, Metta absolutely does. Maybe Zuck's turned [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1750.96s)]
*  in a question that a little bit and you know, it's, it's fun in my opinion to kind of bring [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1756.48s)]
*  different lenses to this list, right? There's the regulatory one that Friedberg was just talking [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1760.64s)]
*  about. I kind of think about if I was the CEO, do I control my own destiny in this market? Right. And [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1765.52s)]
*  I expect these companies are not going to want to be dependent on others and are going to at least [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1770.96s)]
*  want to say, no, I'm going to control my own destiny, whether I win or lose. Who's your number [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1774.8s)]
*  one? Who's your number two? If you had to could only bet on two here to achieve super intelligence, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1779.36s)]
*  AGI, let's just say win the AI re win the AI big prize, the big prize, super intelligence, AGI, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1784.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, in the midterm five years, five years from now, we're sitting here, Thomas, give me [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1792.8799999999999s)]
*  your number one, give me your number two. Look, I think to me, number one, I still think Nvidia, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1796.56s)]
*  right? I don't see the GPU kind of getting displaced. I see additional architectures kind [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1801.52s)]
*  of coming on board, right? And growing the market. But at the end of the day, all roads still lead to [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1806.4s)]
*  the GPU for all of these models. So I would kind of still put kind of Nvidia on that. My number two, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1811.68s)]
*  more of a dark horse, but I would pick Tesla. I do think it has the most potential for vertical [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1819.44s)]
*  integration right from all the way the silicon to the model to actually the hardware right that [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1826.0s)]
*  might become super important, not just in cars, but in optimists. So Nvidia one, Tesla is my dark [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1832.08s)]
*  horse. Wow. Stunning Chamath, who's your number one and number two in the midterm five years from [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1838.16s)]
*  now we're sitting here on all in episode 700. Tesla's one and Google's two. And the reason is [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1843.84s)]
*  because they are the closest to having that vertically integrated stack that I spoke about. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1850.32s)]
*  I think that Tesla has the best vision models. Now with XAI, they'll have one of the best [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1856.8799999999999s)]
*  LLMs and reasoning models. And they'll be able to eventually stick that on dojo. And then all of [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1863.9199999999998s)]
*  that will be in all of the physical AI that you will interact with in your daily life, whether [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1870.3999999999999s)]
*  it's a robot or whether it's a car or whether it's a robot taxi. So that's number one. And then [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1876.4s)]
*  number two, for many of the same reasons, I think Google, because you'll have the Gemini family of [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1882.24s)]
*  models, which just absolutely kick ass like VO3, which we haven't really spoke about is going to [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1888.16s)]
*  destroy Hollywood. Like in the next year, like Hollywood is done, I think. But they're landing [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1894.16s)]
*  model after model. They have the TPU and the next generation TPU I think is exceptional. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1900.48s)]
*  They're baking quantum and then they have an entire funnel of billions of people that they [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1907.2s)]
*  can direct experiences to. So Tesla one, Google two. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1911.6s)]
*  Chumath, quick follow up on that. I'm curious on Google. This is the, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1914.96s)]
*  because I oscillate a lot on this particular name. Can Google win if search declines? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1919.6s)]
*  Yes. And I think that what probably has to happen is, bear with me when I say this, but [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1925.44s)]
*  if you had to boil down Google's economic North Star metric, right, not the value North Star, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1931.68s)]
*  the economic North Star metric would be price per click. And I do think that Google is extremely [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1938.24s)]
*  well positioned to pivot that to price per token. And I think that they have some emergent classes [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1945.44s)]
*  of physical AI, but they have the largest pool of people where they can generate a price per token [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1951.92s)]
*  value framework through YouTube, through Gmail, through workspace, I think through search, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1957.68s)]
*  but probably it's a different kind of model. It just requires them to rip the Band-Aid off [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1964.24s)]
*  at some point. But yeah, I think Google can do it. I'm going to go with you, Chumath. I'm one, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1968.64s)]
*  my one and two are either Google or Elon. And I'll just say Elon, because I, like you, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1974.8000000000002s)]
*  I spent a day up at XAI and I saw what a magnet for talent he is. I got to sit in some meetings and [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1981.68s)]
*  just, he was interviewing people and he was working with that talent eight o'clock at night. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1988.16s)]
*  There's a lot of people there on a Saturday, grinding it out. It was nuts. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1992.0s)]
*  I first went to XAI. In the 15 minutes that I was in the parking lot finishing a call, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=1995.52s)]
*  the kinds of people that were walking in and out of there, you could tell they were big brains. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2000.8s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know how, you know what I mean? Like from every walk of life, they all just looked [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2005.92s)]
*  much smarter than the rest of us. Yeah. And some of them were like chain smoking cigarettes [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2010.0s)]
*  and just like stressed out. It was crazy. I had a couple of zents. I'll be totally honest. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2014.88s)]
*  But the reason I say Elon versus Google is I think Elon's in a unique position. I don't have [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2019.12s)]
*  any insider information here and I haven't talked about this or I'm not back channeling from Elon, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2024.16s)]
*  lest anybody aggregate this. I think what Colossus has done and what Tesla has done, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2028.4s)]
*  both of these things, Tesla with their own stack of hardware, to your point, Chumath, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2035.28s)]
*  hardware plus software plus the user application of FSD and Optimus, then you put that together [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2038.64s)]
*  with the data, the real time data of X, formerly known as Twitter, plus what he's building with XAI [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2044.48s)]
*  and obviously those two companies merged. I think Tesla board, XAI board have to get together, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2051.12s)]
*  put those two companies together. Yeah, I agree. One's worth a trillion, one's worth a hundred [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2055.44s)]
*  billion. Put them and just have all that brain power going in one direction as opposed to Elon [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2059.12s)]
*  test switching between the two. You do that, I think he wins number one. You don't do that, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2064.64s)]
*  I think he either gets one or two. And then I think Google is going to have a better search [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2068.56s)]
*  product, Thomas. I think it's a really important point. Do they lose search share? Does it matter? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2075.2s)]
*  What I think matters is are their ads more effective? Is their ad network more effective? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2079.6s)]
*  And I think based on what they know on you from your chat searches and your discussions and what [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2083.2s)]
*  they analyze in your email, just analyzing your Gmail and your surfing behavior and Chrome, if [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2088.32s)]
*  they get to keep it, your Android phone, if you use it, your YouTube list and what you how, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2093.6s)]
*  when you drop off all in and when you start listening to another podcast, whatever it is, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2098.4s)]
*  all that data, all that data is going to lead to an ad network that performs so much better that [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2101.92s)]
*  even if they lose search share, their ad network is going to continue to grow. And I think it will [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2107.04s)]
*  increase in velocity. So those are my top two. Freiburg, I'm curious from your position, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2111.2799999999997s)]
*  which one you think is number one and number two, I saved you for last because you know what we do [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2116.88s)]
*  here? We saved the best for last. Freiburg, go ahead. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2120.88s)]
*  I think there's a difference in how I would kind of lump them. I think that Tesla probably has [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2123.6s)]
*  the, it is the best place to invest if you want to have a shot at a massive new industry. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2131.6800000000003s)]
*  So they've got a baseline business in obviously the automobiles, but I think this humanoid robot [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2139.04s)]
*  opportunity is absolutely mind-blowingly ginormous. And I don't think that there's [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2146.56s)]
*  a better company on earth positioned to execute against this humanoid robotics [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2151.92s)]
*  opportunity than Tesla. So, you know, it's sort of like, I would call it a low probability, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2157.2s)]
*  high upside sort of call option embedded within that business. And obviously you're paying a [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2162.48s)]
*  premium for that because it is still a very healthy premium. You pay for that business. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2168.08s)]
*  I think Nvidia to Thomas's point, I think the common thesis is it is the most protected, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2172.48s)]
*  the durability of the business is there. But I would argue that there's actually a low probability, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2178.64s)]
*  but very high severity risk to Nvidia in China. There was just a demonstration last month of a [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2183.44s)]
*  one nanometer semiconductor manufacturing process out of China. I think the more that we continue [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2188.56s)]
*  to try and isolate China from a policy perspective, the more we are emboldening investment in China [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2195.6s)]
*  meaning from the government, from private industry into China to create alternatives [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2203.12s)]
*  to the chip stack where the United States companies, particularly Nvidia have a moat [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2207.68s)]
*  today. So I do think that there's going to be an emergent competitive threat coming out of China [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2212.16s)]
*  to Nvidia. And just like we were knocked over by DeepSeek, I think we will be knocked over [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2217.12s)]
*  by some semiconductor manufacturing processes coming out of China in the near term. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2222.16s)]
*  But the overall kind of- By the way, Dave, just on that point, I think Saks's work on the diffusion [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2227.44s)]
*  rule just generally, I don't think has kind of gotten enough attention in the rescinding of the [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2233.44s)]
*  diffusion rule, which essentially handicapped our ability to even arm our allies with our [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2238.4s)]
*  semiconductor technology, in my opinion, was kind of a milestone and very important moment [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2246.7200000000003s)]
*  to try and offset exactly what you were just describing. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2253.2799999999997s)]
*  Exactly right. I mean, there was a report a few months ago and I mentioned it on the show, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2257.12s)]
*  or maybe I didn't, or maybe I sent it to Saks and we talked about it offline. I can't remember, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2261.8399999999997s)]
*  but it was about a $40 billion investment being made in developing competitive semiconductor [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2265.6s)]
*  manufacturing full stack solutions out of China. So I do think that the lithography IP [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2270.64s)]
*  moat is being crossed in China. I do think that China is developing actually new technology [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2277.2799999999997s)]
*  for a DUV and EUV systems. I do think that there's a risk to Nvidia's core. Now look, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2283.12s)]
*  Nvidia is such a durable business. There's great modes, great advantages, but we're creating every [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2289.2799999999997s)]
*  incentive for an alternative to Nvidia to emerge from China. And then my third kind of categorization [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2293.8399999999997s)]
*  would be what's the portfolio solution. I think that's Google. I think that there's a diversification [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2300.16s)]
*  of high beta bets inside of Google of any one of which could have, call it a trillion dollar [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2306.08s)]
*  market cap outcome ranging from Waymo to quantum computing to the biologics work that Demis is [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2312.24s)]
*  working on out of isomorphic. There's a number of things that do not get a lot of attention at [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2320.0s)]
*  Google. So yes, there's a core business that may be at risk, Thomas, but I think that there's a [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2326.3199999999997s)]
*  portfolio of options you get at Google and you just need any one of them to hit to kind of make [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2332.3999999999996s)]
*  up for the loss. But I do think also Sundar in my interview with him, which we put out a couple of [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2338.88s)]
*  weeks ago, is very thoughtful about where search evolves to. And he is being, I think, reasonably [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2342.48s)]
*  aggressive in trying to evolve the search product architecture to meet the market, to meet the [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2348.2400000000002s)]
*  consumer. I do give him credit for that. So Google would be in a good place for me as an overall kind [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2353.6800000000003s)]
*  of pick in that set of options. So just to be clear, Nvidia one Google to or Nvidia Tesla? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2358.88s)]
*  Like I said, I think in terms of like having the right sharp ratio is how I would think about it, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2363.6800000000003s)]
*  the alpha and the beta adjusted returns, I would put Google number one, I would probably put Tesla, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2367.6s)]
*  Tesla's valuation, I think already has a premium associated with those options. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2374.7999999999997s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. So I don't know if I would really pay that premium. I think. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2378.4s)]
*  Well, aside from the valuations, let's take valuations out of it. Just the game here is who [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2381.6s)]
*  wins the AI prize five years from now. That's how I understood it as well. Yeah. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2387.68s)]
*  So valuation irrelevant. Valuation irrelevant. Who wins the AI prize? One, you're saying Google, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2391.92s)]
*  two, you're saying Tesla. I think Google's in such a position. I mean, look, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2397.12s)]
*  Demis, I think has been fairly coy about where they are. They obviously promote Gemini 2.5, but [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2401.68s)]
*  there's a lot still coming. And as Chamath pointed out, it's not just LLMs. There's a pretty sizable [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2408.64s)]
*  family of models, including a lot of these graph based models that are being used in really novel [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2416.08s)]
*  applications that no one else is even close to. No one's spending time on. I mean, some of the [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2422.88s)]
*  weather forecasting, it might seem small and trivial, but it's a demonstration of Google's [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2427.84s)]
*  competency in core model development that shows an understanding and a depth of research and work [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2432.1600000000003s)]
*  that goes well beyond LLMs. So I'm pretty bullish on the depth of talent, the full stack. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2438.4s)]
*  And whatever they learn there could apply to Gmail, could apply to search, could apply to ads, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2443.6s)]
*  could apply to YouTube algorithm, right? It just goes up and down. Yeah. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2447.6800000000003s)]
*  From a product perspective, I do think you see this kind of multi-model emergence that we're [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2451.04s)]
*  now seeing. No one talks about this single model that sits behind the application. There are multiple [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2456.88s)]
*  models that work together. And obviously, this agentic architecture unlocks another layer of [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2462.88s)]
*  not just kind of solutions to complexity. And so there's quite a lot, I think, that's emergent here [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2470.2400000000002s)]
*  that Google will start to kind of benefit from in the year ahead. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2476.8s)]
*  I mean, for those of us who love tech, right? If we step back for a minute, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2480.4s)]
*  I really feel like to use the analogy of this podcast, like we are now at the WSL World Series [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2485.6s)]
*  of Poker, right? We got seven companies around the table. The stacks are trillion in size, right? And [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2491.6800000000003s)]
*  all of us are going to get a front row seat to see what happens over the next five years. I mean, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2499.12s)]
*  on top of that, we're going to get to analyze, bet ourselves on who we think is going to win. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2503.92s)]
*  We know there's some other companies that are pushing to get at that table, right? With some [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2508.4s)]
*  sharp elbows. I mean, what a time to be doing what we're doing. I don't know if I love the analogy [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2512.24s)]
*  because I don't think, first of all, it's a zero sum game where there's this X number of chips and [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2517.12s)]
*  someone ends up with all the chips. I do think you could see as an example, just talking about [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2520.72s)]
*  the scenarios we just described, Tesla developing an extraordinary humanoid robot business that's [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2525.04s)]
*  worth a trillion dollars. Google building, to Chamoff's point, a media empire based on [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2531.28s)]
*  generative AI in media. And then, Nvidia building an entirely new chip stack that everyone's [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2536.5600000000004s)]
*  participating in. So all of them in an ecosystem based way could be major winners here. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2542.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. I didn't mean it in the zero sum nature of it. I meant it more in the stakes, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2546.5600000000004s)]
*  right? And the competition. Yes. And there's a lot of hands to be, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2551.6800000000003s)]
*  I like the analogy because there's a lot of hands to be played. And there is a price pool, right? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2554.48s)]
*  You could have three or four people at that table. One thing I just want to point out here is just [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2559.52s)]
*  speaking of regime change, what is going on at Apple? Siri was just the early idea of an AI agent. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2563.92s)]
*  It's just totally disgust. It's disgusting. It doesn't work. It's embarrassing. And then [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2570.6400000000003s)]
*  their biggest developer conference, they're redoing the UI. Is this time for regime change at Apple? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2575.28s)]
*  No, this has happened many, many, many times in many industries before, which is that companies [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2583.52s)]
*  that were stalwart organizations transition themselves from being a growth business to being [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2590.9599999999996s)]
*  a cash cow. And these are well documented transitions. And it requires an extremely brutal [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2596.7999999999997s)]
*  reset if you want to shake that up. Yes. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2605.3599999999997s)]
*  I think that the same thing that I think you have to respect Apple for, which is stability, the [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2608.88s)]
*  duration of some of their best, longest serving executives are there for 20 and 30 years. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2615.44s)]
*  On the scale of innovation, it's a horrible thing. And the reason is that we all just get old. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2621.44s)]
*  Our skill sets become rusty. And we don't have the energy or the capacity to think about what [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2628.32s)]
*  the future actually looks like because we are not living it. And then what happens is you task those [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2635.44s)]
*  decisions to people that you try to hire. But you saw it in the clip with Sam, even in all of that [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2640.8s)]
*  crazy recruiting chaos that's happening right now for these brilliant machine learning and AI people, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2648.56s)]
*  maybe that's a fight between OpenAI, Meta, and maybe Google. But what you don't hear is Apple. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2654.4s)]
*  So who's Apple getting? I have to think that Apple is not getting any of those people. So by the time [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2661.52s)]
*  you end up at Apple, it's just a different caliber of person. That is true. And they're living inside [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2666.32s)]
*  of a cash cow organization that's going to optimize for don't make mistakes. Right. But that's how it's [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2673.12s)]
*  happened to HP. It's happened to Lotus. It's happened to Intel. It's happened to General Electric. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2680.56s)]
*  It's happened to umpteen companies. It's just and it's happening to Apple. So we should just [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2686.24s)]
*  not sweat it and move on. I don't know, Thomas, what are your thoughts? I mean, it's kind of [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2692.3199999999997s)]
*  shocking with all that cash. And they don't acquire anything to head project Titan, $10 billion to [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2696.08s)]
*  build their own car. And they just shut it down. Imagine if they kept going with that. You think [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2702.9599999999996s)]
*  regime change time, maybe Tim Cook retires and put somebody who was a product person in charge of it, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2707.2799999999997s)]
*  or maybe they should merge with Tesla and put Elon in charge of it all. There just seems to be [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2711.4399999999996s)]
*  no new products coming out of there. Like it's absolutely confounding that they're optimizing [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2716.16s)]
*  for share buybacks and earnings per share instead of having some amount of that money [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2722.56s)]
*  go towards innovation and acquiring companies. Biggest acquisition is beats. Give me a break. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2727.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting, right for me, and I've studied Apple, basically my whole career. And [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2733.2s)]
*  it's kind of interesting, right? Because if you think about the they're defining competitive [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2739.52s)]
*  advantage, right, was the integration of hardware and software that led to the beautiful MacBook [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2745.28s)]
*  that we're all using, it led to the iPhone and right, the fact that they were so coupled [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2749.2000000000003s)]
*  between hardware and software, the user interface, you know, etc. And I think it directly led to them [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2753.6800000000003s)]
*  winning, let's call the mobile era, right. But I think back to Tomas point, and I think the analogy [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2758.7200000000003s)]
*  holds in AI, they're the opposite, right? They don't control, I don't, you know, the silicon, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2764.5600000000004s)]
*  they don't control the underlying models. And so now they're back to maybe, you know, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2770.56s)]
*  using a historical analogy, the PC makers who didn't control the OS. That's right. So I think [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2776.16s)]
*  the good news for them is, look, they still have a monopoly on users, they have 3 trillion of market [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2781.68s)]
*  cap to kind of play with. So I think it's way too early to count them out. But I think, you know, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2787.44s)]
*  the market, let's pause it, what's the most extreme thing that they could do, right, just for, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2793.92s)]
*  just for intellectual sake, right? Buy open AI for 500 billion, I'm just gonna put a crazy thing [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2798.72s)]
*  out there, right? So you think, okay, that's the most extreme, is it even that extreme? And what [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2804.48s)]
*  would Apple stock do that day? Go up? That's my view, too, right? I actually think it would go up, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2810.0s)]
*  not down, even if they did something like that. So I do think they need to be kind of aggressive. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2816.08s)]
*  I do think to your point, I think Freeburg, it is important that, you know, all seven of these [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2822.4s)]
*  companies could actually win and do well, right? That is the absolute possibility. But I would love [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2826.08s)]
*  to see them be a little bit more aggressive. I mean, you guys remember when Steve Jobs bought [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2833.04s)]
*  Fingerworks, right? It was this tiny acquisition, they made this little trackpad that you could use [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2838.16s)]
*  your fingers on, no one figured out why they did this, and then in turn into multi touch and [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2842.24s)]
*  scrolling, right? So I think it's, it's going to be fascinating to see what they do. Thomas, that was [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2846.7999999999997s)]
*  a great question. I was about to ask if Apple could do one thing, they could do one internal [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2852.48s)]
*  project or buy one external company, maybe we could do both around the horn, what would we [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2856.88s)]
*  advise them to do? My number one is build a humanoid robot. Like, how does Apple not have [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2860.88s)]
*  a humanoid robot? That seems like that's obviously the next giant consumer market is having optimists [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2865.84s)]
*  or figure in your house. Freeburg, I'm going to go to you first, since I went to you last last time. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2871.2s)]
*  Is there a product that they could do, that they could build that they would be uniquely suited to [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2876.56s)]
*  that would turn this all around? If you could pick it on their roadmap, what would it be? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2883.2000000000003s)]
*  I do think there is, I do think they're doing it. And I do think they have a shot at winning, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2886.56s)]
*  which is this kind of ambient AI assistant. I don't know about you guys, I must own 30 frigging [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2890.0s)]
*  Apple devices. I have many Apple computers I use in different offices. I have phones, I have many [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2895.44s)]
*  AirPods, I got everything, watches, everything. I'm ubiquitous on the Apple platform. So I'm an [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2901.68s)]
*  easy transition into this if it works. So as everyone races to build kind of the agentic AI [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2907.12s)]
*  assistant that is sort of in my ear all the time or available where I don't have to stare at my [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2914.16s)]
*  frigging phone like this, it is a great unlock for humanity. It's a great unlock as a consumer. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2920.16s)]
*  It's feasible technically. And I'm sure Apple of everyone that we've referenced today is best [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2926.08s)]
*  suited to both access the consumer design and engineer the solution in a way that can be truly [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2933.44s)]
*  transformative. I think it references a little bit what Johnny Ive and Sam Altman have been talking [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2939.2s)]
*  about doing. But I do think that this is exactly the direction Apple is headed. And I do think [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2944.72s)]
*  that they've got a very great shot at winning at it. I don't think they need to own the full stack [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2950.64s)]
*  to be successful here. Got it. Okay, so we've got optimists, we got the device you're talking [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2954.88s)]
*  about this ambient assistant is part Siri and part maybe a pendant that records your behavior [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2959.44s)]
*  in the world and gives you feedback to it. And that's what they're calling a puck, perhaps that [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2965.28s)]
*  Johnny Ive has made or these pendants that record everything. Thomas, what's your thought on the [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2969.44s)]
*  one product they could create? To that point, it's interesting to think that the air pod business [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2974.4s)]
*  at Apple is 3x opening eyes revenue base today. That's right. And that's just the air pod business. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2981.36s)]
*  And by the way, let me let me just say one thing about this. We all think about devices in the [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2986.6400000000003s)]
*  context of a single device being an assistant. I think if there are more devices integrated into [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2990.56s)]
*  our lives, and the assistant is ethereal and ubiquitous amongst the devices, it's almost like [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=2997.92s)]
*  the Star Trek Next Generation, you walk in, you say, Hey, computer, and there's always a device [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3004.88s)]
*  available that's doing things, there's always a device observing, there's always a device able [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3008.96s)]
*  to take care of things for you, whether it's in your ear, whether it's your phone, whether it's [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3012.2400000000002s)]
*  your watch. But basically, these devices all instead of acting independently, they all know [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3015.68s)]
*  what you've been asking or talking about with the other devices. And so you could get in your car, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3020.96s)]
*  and you could pick up, you know, the conversation you were having, you know, while you were sitting [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3025.76s)]
*  in your office in front of your computer to do work. And so the agent effectively is almost like [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3030.08s)]
*  the sephirial ambient assistant. So everywhere you go, the agent is there. They can even be in [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3034.88s)]
*  a candle lit bath with you. Well, I mean, by the way, think about also, you know, it having [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3039.76s)]
*  identity, so it knows who you are. So I could be in your room in your home, J Cal, not that I would [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3046.56s)]
*  ever get invited to your home. But let's say I was there, yeah, you know, I could walk into the living [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3051.28s)]
*  room, and there's your puck, and it starts talking to me because it knows it's you I am. And yeah, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3055.92s)]
*  it's like, it knows me. Yeah. Or you and I have a bath for two, you and I could be a candle lit [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3060.08s)]
*  bath for two. And it would know that when each of us are fighting over what music we want to play, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3064.24s)]
*  the assistant will, you know, hear out the debate. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3068.56s)]
*  A shared playlist. Chamath, do you have a device before we go on to IPOs here? Do you have a device [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3070.9599999999996s)]
*  or an angle for Apple to go after if they were truly ambitious? Or maybe they are, and it's just [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3076.08s)]
*  in stealth. What do you think? You think it's the goggles, the glasses, you think it's a pendant, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3081.6s)]
*  you think it's optimist? What do you think? I don't think they have any chance of anything. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3084.8799999999997s)]
*  Great. Love it. I would take the exact opposite of what Freebrook says. Look at this chart. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3089.4399999999996s)]
*  And I'll tell you why. Okay, here we go. Great discussion. This chart is not a strategy. So this [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3094.24s)]
*  is a chart of Apple's revenue. And what you see is iPhone is completely stalled out. And so to [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3099.04s)]
*  Thomas's point, where do you make money? You make money in other hardware. This is not a strategy [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3104.64s)]
*  of success. This is a strategy of inefficiency. I lost my AirPods. I need to buy a new pair. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3109.9199999999996s)]
*  Oh, the cable's changed. I need to buy a bunch of those. This and that. And a this and that strategy [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3115.68s)]
*  is not a strategy. It's a tactical play for revenue optimization in the short term. A company [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3121.28s)]
*  that focuses on this kind of revenue growth is not capable of creating something that's [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3126.1600000000003s)]
*  exceptionally unexpected. That will come from a new company who has no ties to the past, [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3132.1600000000003s)]
*  has no nostalgia on the fact that we're going to swap out the connector type and, you know, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3138.7200000000003s)]
*  book another billion dollars. What Thomas said is an indictment actually about their ability to do [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3143.84s)]
*  it. When your AirPods business is two or three times bigger than OpenAI, what there is internally [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3149.12s)]
*  when you try to have a strategy meeting about what to do is derision about OpenAI because you're like [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3156.0s)]
*  that's small. And even our AirPods business is three times big. That's what some smart ass [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3161.3599999999997s)]
*  MBA will say in that meeting and it'll shut the meeting down. So how do you expect that culture [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3167.12s)]
*  to then all of a sudden get their act together? I think it's exceptionally hard. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3174.16s)]
*  It's a good point. And here's the clip on cue. Play the clip, Nick. It's a great point. Here's [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3178.16s)]
*  the clip. I'm Apple nostalgic. Me too. Bring Steve Jobs back. Watch this lunacy. You probably saw [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3183.2s)]
*  that Johnny Ive is linked up with OpenAI to create some sort of future AI device. Yeah, I don't know [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3188.56s)]
*  what that is. I don't either. Is this a space that Apple's looking at? Is this a space that goes [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3194.7999999999997s)]
*  beyond what you have in the current lineup of devices? Something that is more personal? Maybe [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3199.84s)]
*  you wear it glasses. I think I mean, I think we have some extremely personal wearable devices. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3205.52s)]
*  If you want something that's aware of your environment with with audio, I think you're [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3212.08s)]
*  you're wearing one right now on on your wrist. If you want something that you can capture the [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3217.12s)]
*  environment with and see and also receive visual content, you might just have one in your pocket [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3223.04s)]
*  right now. Are there other form factors that can make sense to AI? Sure, but pretty hard to beat [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3227.84s)]
*  something that's with you all the time and glanceable or, you know, provides a nice screen [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3236.8s)]
*  that you can interact with. So, yeah, I don't know what they're working on. What do you think, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3241.52s)]
*  Jermuff? Again, I think I want to be very clear about what I'm saying. That is a very competent, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3247.28s)]
*  Craig Federici, very, very competent executive. And whoever the person beside him is, that guy's, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3252.48s)]
*  I'm going to assume competent as well. They're competent at making money the way that they've [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3260.0s)]
*  made money for the last 17 years with no meaningful disturbance. And I think it's just something to [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3267.6s)]
*  appreciate that after 17 years of unmitigated linear success, it's very difficult to retool [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3276.32s)]
*  yourself. It's like asking Michael Jordan to go and all of a sudden become an all-star baseball. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3283.84s)]
*  It doesn't work. And so I think I think it's okay, though, this is my point. It's okay, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3288.48s)]
*  guys, to have creative destruction of companies. Like there was probably a version of us [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3294.6400000000003s)]
*  blathering on about HP and being nostalgic about the transistor radio that they made. And the, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3300.0s)]
*  HP 12B calculator that they made and oh my God, why can't they figure their shit out? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3306.32s)]
*  And where are we today? HP doesn't even exist. It's okay. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3311.04s)]
*  I mean, just Thomas, the fact that they launched Siri, they bought that company and Siri can't do [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3315.44s)]
*  anything other than like an alarm, can barely play a song, it barely can do directions. I mean, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3322.16s)]
*  literally we're in year like 27 of Siri and it can't do anything. And then I have the Google [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3328.96s)]
*  and Grok voice. And when I turn that on, it does whatever I want. It will load on my pixel, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3335.44s)]
*  it loads other applications, fires it off the specific tasks and it's absolutely just [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3340.96s)]
*  Grazia on your on your pixel. I have a pixel when I when I flip open my pixel. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3345.44s)]
*  I have a lot. I have the pixel nine. Chamath. It's the Anaconda of smartphones pixel nine [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3351.2000000000003s)]
*  foldable. Got it. It's the greatest assistant ever. It's what Siri it's what Steve Jobs showed [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3357.2000000000003s)]
*  Siri. I had you at nine. Yeah, I'd made Anaconda. Yeah, I had you at nine inches. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3362.88s)]
*  Yeah, we can all aspire maybe get Roman. Thomas, what were you gonna say? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3366.48s)]
*  Get that extra inch Thomas. Go ahead. Chamath, I would argue to you that I think this management [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3369.44s)]
*  team has done it once. And it's in the transition of their gross profit base, which doesn't show [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3373.44s)]
*  in the chart that you just highlighted. But was something that I kind of lived as an analyst [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3379.6800000000003s)]
*  covering the stock for a long time, where if you remember over a decade ago, 90 plus percent of [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3384.0s)]
*  their gross profit was a one time hardware sale on the iPhone. And no one thought that they would [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3388.88s)]
*  ever be able to get away from the drug of selling that one iPhone unit, right, and cut to, you know, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3396.2400000000002s)]
*  over a decade later, it's 40%. Right. And I don't think they get enough credit for actually [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3401.52s)]
*  transitioning from hardware to a recurring gross profit base. But look, you might argue that that [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3408.0s)]
*  was an easier pivot and challenge than what they're going to face. And so let's see whether they can [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3413.28s)]
*  do it. The other thing guys, I wonder about, let's I know we want to talk about IPOs, but [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3418.08s)]
*  I do wonder whether Zuck buying scale for 15 billion gives air cover for other companies [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3425.04s)]
*  to really start being aggressive, right. And and to me, as we think about Circle and Coreweave, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3431.36s)]
*  two companies that have gone IPO recently, it's, it's kind of amazing, kind of numerically that [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3438.16s)]
*  the charts are almost identical, even, you know, on a dollar basis, on a share price, right. Because [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3444.48s)]
*  to me, what it says, we were talking about the dispersion of the Mac seven before, right, which [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3451.12s)]
*  are going to do well, which are not, I expect we're going to have a lot of opinions on this over the [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3455.6s)]
*  next few years. And frankly, they may change. We you know, we may think Apple one way today, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3459.04s)]
*  it may change in a month, right. But I do think the market is starting to realize that there is [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3463.12s)]
*  dispersion that AI might create some all winners or some winners and then some losers, right, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3468.56s)]
*  and is starting to think about, okay, how do I want to be positioned for the next five years? [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3475.44s)]
*  What are big open ended growth opportunities? And here comes two companies, one lever to crypto, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3479.92s)]
*  right, and the other lever to AI. So I don't think it's a surprise to me, these things are intertwined. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3485.68s)]
*  You're 100% on because here's the thing, the average profit margin of the S&P 493 [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3491.44s)]
*  is drum roll, please, 12%. The average growth of the S&P 493 is drum roll, please, single digits. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3497.52s)]
*  So to your point, why would you belong any of these 493 companies that may turn around and one [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3506.4s)]
*  day just get decapitated by something you don't even know that's getting cooked up by a couple [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3512.72s)]
*  kids in a garage using open AI or grok or what have you. It just makes a lot more sense when [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3517.12s)]
*  you find investable companies in the big themes of the future to add a minimum hedge, right, be [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3523.76s)]
*  less long the past and frankly make some bets about the future. And I think that that's where [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3530.1600000000003s)]
*  you're seeing these IPOs just absolutely rip. What is a better comparison in my opinion are [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3537.76s)]
*  the companies that are truly levered to the future themes of AI and crypto versus any of these IPOs [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3543.28s)]
*  that have happened of companies that are not. And I think what you see is there's a dispersion [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3549.84s)]
*  there as well. And they are being treated almost as similarly, Jason, as the S&P 493. It's like, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3554.6400000000003s)]
*  yeah, it's good. Yeah, it's fine. They get some reasonable gains. But if you're levered to any of [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3563.2000000000003s)]
*  those two trends, you're off to the races because it's just so disruptive. People don't want to be [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3567.6000000000004s)]
*  bag holding these old legacy companies. We're already into our next topic, which is IPOs and [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3575.04s)]
*  M&A. Lena Conn is no longer in the building and M&A is back on the menu as our IPOs as Thomas pointed [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3579.12s)]
*  out three IPOs March 28, June 5, and June 12 core weave circle and chime. Obviously core weave of [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3587.68s)]
*  four X after going public $81 billion market cap absolutely stunning circle 25 X oversubscribed [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3593.44s)]
*  six X from its opening price $48 billion market cap chime. That's a neo bank like new bank, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3599.8399999999997s)]
*  which is already public that was up 40% in its IPO price, but then it went down 20% $12 billion [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3605.12s)]
*  market cap. On the other side of the ledge, we have a ton of M&A this year. So when you look at [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3611.52s)]
*  what's happening under the Trump administration, look at what's actually happening. The game on [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3616.72s)]
*  the field is three major IPOs and then massive amounts of billion dollar acquisitions. Obviously, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3620.88s)]
*  we talked about Google acquiring whiz for 32 billion. Softbank bought and peer. I don't know [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3627.7599999999998s)]
*  what they do 6.5 billion open AI bought two companies, one for 3 billion one for 6.5 billion [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3632.56s)]
*  developer co pilot windsurf 3 billion Johnny Ives IO making some sort of a puck or hardware device. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3638.72s)]
*  Databricks brought neon for a billion Salesforce did an $8 billion acquisition. And then [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3644.96s)]
*  interesting door dash bought two companies Uber made two smaller acquisitions. There is a ton of [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3650.24s)]
*  activity here. What does it say about the market David Friedberg that we're seeing so much M&A [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3655.44s)]
*  and these amazing IPO is coming out all within the last three, four months. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3662.72s)]
*  Okay, so let me just follow up to a comment Chamath made and ask Thomas his view. I have a [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3668.32s)]
*  theory and I haven't looked empirically to see if it makes sense for most of the S&P 500. The [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3676.08s)]
*  fundamental profit growth is pretty anemic with the exception obviously of a couple of the big [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3682.56s)]
*  tech outliers, the mag seven and a few others. But for the majority of the S&P, this is a pretty [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3688.4s)]
*  kind of anemic environment relative to the transitions that are underway in the world [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3695.12s)]
*  fundamentally with AI and ancillary technology. So are the institutional fund managers hungry [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3699.44s)]
*  for access to some of these new, you know, high growth offerings? And they have been held off [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3706.88s)]
*  because just to kind of go back, I think it was around 2008 or so, public institutional [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3713.92s)]
*  fund managers started to do crossover investing into private equities. And that scaled up and [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3718.88s)]
*  scaled up and it entered obviously a stage where it was a heavy flurry, a lot of activity and a [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3724.08s)]
*  lot of crossover late stage investing, you know, right until 2021 when things started to pop 2022. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3729.36s)]
*  And because they were overexposed with their private equity portfolios relative to their [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3736.96s)]
*  public equities, they came out of 21, 22 with the market declining and they now had a higher [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3742.64s)]
*  concentration of private equities than they were supposed to have. And so they have been kept out [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3748.56s)]
*  of the market for the last three or so years of the private market. And now is there kind of this [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3753.12s)]
*  pent up hunger or pent up demand for new issuances for high growth tech issuances? Is that what we're [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3757.7599999999998s)]
*  seeing? Is there kind of this pent up demand because they've had to stay out of the private [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3763.52s)]
*  market for three years? And if there is obviously bodes well for late stage growth startups that [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3767.76s)]
*  are looking to go public because the demand will be there. And I think the reports were [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3772.8s)]
*  that the chime IPO was like 18x oversubscribed. I think you're right in something that, you know, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3777.28s)]
*  I've talked about with you guys and was a big conversation at the All In Summit last year [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3782.4s)]
*  was the health of the private ecosystem, right? And we talked about the concept of look, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3788.88s)]
*  if you put a dollar in, you need to get a dollar out, right? And so I do think that we're starting [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3795.04s)]
*  to see a healthier market where we know a lot of dollars have gone in, but now we're starting to [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3800.2400000000002s)]
*  see some dollars coming out. So I think that's both in M&A, by the way, and it's also in IPOs. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3804.72s)]
*  So I think that's one element. But I also think the second element, which is where the tailwind [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3809.36s)]
*  of the mobile and SaaS era, right? And even if you look at the SaaS companies, we kind of put [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3814.16s)]
*  this together in our deck when we were preparing it for our conference this week. Chamath, I think [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3820.56s)]
*  you'll find this interesting, right? If you look at SaaS in 2021, the median growth rate for SaaS [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3825.44s)]
*  companies was 17% and a quarter of those were growing over 25%. Okay. If you look at SaaS today, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3831.7599999999998s)]
*  the growth rate has been cut in half, 17% to 9%. And only 5% of that cohort is now grown above [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3839.92s)]
*  25%. So I think, Dave, what's clearly happening, right, is other sectors, which were predominantly [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3847.84s)]
*  seen to be growth are now slowing down, right? So that's kind of one piece. So the market can [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3854.8s)]
*  no longer just rely on saying, oh, I'm just going to own the best summer SaaS index, right, for the [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3860.2400000000002s)]
*  next decade, and I'll do great, because those companies have really slowed down. And I think [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3865.04s)]
*  it's starting to look forward and think, okay, now over the next five to 10 years, what are the [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3869.84s)]
*  companies that can compound at maybe 25% per year over that timeframe? And I think companies [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3875.84s)]
*  like CoreWeave and Circle and Chime, by the way, and others are going to kind of fill that gap. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3881.76s)]
*  I really like this chart. If I had to guess about what has changed from 2021 to 2025, [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3887.36s)]
*  is that most companies have realized that buying yet another vertical software solution [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3896.2400000000002s)]
*  is not going to help their business. That it typically adds bloat, it adds cost, and it adds [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3904.8799999999997s)]
*  people. And I think starting in 2023, what people started to guess is at some point in the near [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3912.0s)]
*  future, you're going to have some AI way of rewriting all of this vertical software. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3919.68s)]
*  And I think that's why it stopped growing. I don't think this SaaS market ever had the return on [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3927.2799999999997s)]
*  equity that it was supposed to. And I think so many companies have woken up from this hangover [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3934.8799999999997s)]
*  saying, there's got to be a better way. It can't always be yet another tool, yet another program, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3940.16s)]
*  yet another multi-year delay, yet another price escalator. And I think that the jig is totally [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3946.96s)]
*  up for software. You're referring to the Salesforce and the SaaS category, Chamath, and what you're [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3955.12s)]
*  doing at 8090 specifically. Yeah. Well, it's not just us, but if you look at anybody that's [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3961.92s)]
*  rebuilding software, it is so much easier to rebuild software from scratch today. My team of [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3966.56s)]
*  30 people can transact hundreds of millions of dollars of work, not because we are so prolifically [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3974.88s)]
*  amazing, but frankly because, well, I think the team is good, but honestly because the underlying [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3982.08s)]
*  tool chain gives you a level of leverage. And so if you rebuild the software development life cycle [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3986.7999999999997s)]
*  using these tools, you can't help it, but become much more efficient. And you can't help it, but [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=3993.6s)]
*  deliver custom solutions that are meaningfully cheaper. And I think, Jason, if you look at the [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4000.08s)]
*  entirety of the software that runs the world, we're going to rebuild it. Soup to nuts. All of that. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4005.12s)]
*  And the tool you're referring to just for the audience is the AI co-pilots that are contributing [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4011.92s)]
*  30, 40% to code bases at Microsoft and Google. Less specifically that, because those are good [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4017.52s)]
*  for individual people, but the software development life cycle is more the horizontal end to end of [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4023.6800000000003s)]
*  making things. Got it. So what we do internally at 8090 is we have an entire process that starts [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4028.4s)]
*  from the PRD all the way out to the functioning code. And we use different techniques at each [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4033.92s)]
*  step, but what you get is a 50, 60, 70% increase at each step, which then compounds. And so you [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4038.88s)]
*  have the ability of a team that would otherwise be able to service tens of millions of dollars, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4046.6400000000003s)]
*  be a team that can service hundreds of millions, and then a team that would otherwise service [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4052.56s)]
*  hundreds can service billions. Let me ask you guys your response to this theory. If there is going [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4056.4s)]
*  to be this kind of accelerated, call it custom software rebuild of business models, and you take [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4062.56s)]
*  the S&P 493, do you think that we enter an era where there is a similar dispersion as we're [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4069.6s)]
*  talking about seeing in the mag seven with the S&P 493, where there are going to be probably the [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4076.4s)]
*  biggest moneymaking opportunities for investors that we've seen in decades between those that do [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4082.88s)]
*  adopt and do rebuild using AI and those that don't or are lagging? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4090.16s)]
*  100%. No, I had a call yesterday with one of the largest private equity funds in the world, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4095.68s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars under management, and we're doing something with them at 8090 [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4101.68s)]
*  with one of their most important assets. And when you're an owner of a business [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4105.92s)]
*  and you can direct very specific change, and you can rip out hundreds of millions of dollars [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4112.8s)]
*  of software licenses and replace it with tens of millions of dollars of highly customized software, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4123.12s)]
*  it's an enormous lift to OPEX and business model quality. So why doesn't it happen more? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4132.719999999999s)]
*  The reason it doesn't happen right now for the S&P 493 is that the IT organizations inside all [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4138.64s)]
*  companies essentially speak a different language than the CEO, the CFO, and the board. So if the [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4144.72s)]
*  CEO, CFO, and the board of directors of the S&P 493 speak English, the IT organization speaks [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4151.28s)]
*  Mandarin Chinese, and you get away with saying all kinds of bulls**t. I'll give you an example. I went [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4158.08s)]
*  to a CIO conference, one person that I met, an $18 billion a year IT budget. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4163.28s)]
*  What the f**k does that actually even mean? To spend $18 billion a year on IT? I'm not saying [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4172.96s)]
*  that this is a mag seven company, guys. And when you take that example and you multiply it by 50 [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4180.48s)]
*  and 100 and 493 examples of people spending money, there's an entire cartel of influence [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4186.24s)]
*  that's been built in software that's going to get undone because you're not going to be able [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4193.2s)]
*  to justify it, Friedberg. Absolutely correct, Trimoth. And the response from the SaaS industry [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4197.36s)]
*  is changing from the per seat model as the number of employees at these companies continues to get [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4202.5599999999995s)]
*  lowered. Obviously, Microsoft, a lot of layoffs, Andy Jassy talking about layoffs. They're moving [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4208.08s)]
*  from the per seat model. They're not taking this laying down. They know that people are going to [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4213.76s)]
*  make custom software. So what they're doing is they're moving to a consumption model. So you're [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4218.64s)]
*  seeing people charge per call, per customer support call, et cetera. I know, but that doesn't work. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4221.84s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you why it doesn't work, Jason. It's working in combination. Hold on, hold on, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4227.84s)]
*  let me finish. The other thing they're doing is they're dramatically lowering the number of [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4231.04s)]
*  people and the developers they have on their team. And then a lot of what's happening in the [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4234.64s)]
*  background is the third piece they're doing is they're starting to do roll-ups and people are [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4238.56s)]
*  starting to talk about how can we take 20 of these SaaS companies, lower them just like you're [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4243.44s)]
*  doing to compete. Trimoth, your thought on that three-part playbook. No, I was just going to say, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4248.5599999999995s)]
*  well, I just wanted to comment on this consumption-based pricing. It doesn't work. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4253.2s)]
*  And what I mean is you can have some adoption in the short term. The best example is Snowflake. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4256.96s)]
*  But in the long term, it destroys your business. And the reason is because you don't know which [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4262.4s)]
*  data is valuable and you're not going to put up with a variable business model that increases [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4267.28s)]
*  more and more costs because you need to trap everything. And so what happens is [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4272.4s)]
*  all of these other companies develop around you. People go back to Postpress, people go to Super [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4276.32s)]
*  Base. They find all of these ways of saying Snowflake makes no sense. And the reason is [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4281.5199999999995s)]
*  because in this world, nobody's going to pay consumption because you're like, how do you [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4287.12s)]
*  expect me to hold and store and pay for terabytes and terabytes, potentially a day of data? It's [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4291.04s)]
*  not sustainable. We'll see if Intercom, Salesforce, HubSpot, we see if all of those [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4298.88s)]
*  people start Slack, start losing their customer base or if they lower their pricing to make it [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4303.84s)]
*  just too easy to keep those systems in. Tom, your thoughts. Yeah. So two quick thoughts. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4308.08s)]
*  Number one, Trimoth, to put a kind of a mathematical frame on this, right? We know that [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4312.72s)]
*  Anthropic is kind of the level zero of code generation. They're doing incredibly well [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4317.76s)]
*  powering companies like Cursor, right? I think in this is order of magnitude, correct, that [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4323.04s)]
*  Anthropic and Q1 added 70% of the net new ARR in the SaaS industry, right? Defined by public SaaS [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4328.32s)]
*  companies, right? So let's just think that the company in AI that is most powering the disruption [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4335.759999999999s)]
*  of SaaS added three quarters of the net new of the entire industry, right? So that's kind of point [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4341.599999999999s)]
*  number one. I think Friedberg, point number two, I think what we're seeing in the Mac seven, right? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4346.16s)]
*  Where we're starting to have debates about who's well positioned and who isn't, who's going to win [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4351.36s)]
*  and who isn't, right? Is actually as it was in the past five years, going to be a broader lens [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4355.12s)]
*  into the S&P 493. I think inside of boardrooms, inside of every investment committee, you're going [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4361.04s)]
*  to see the exact same conversations that we've been having about the Mac seven, right? Who's well [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4367.68s)]
*  positioned, who can win? What are the management teams maybe like Zuck that are being aggressive [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4373.2s)]
*  and bold and capturing the opportunity and which are the ones that are not? So for me as a stock [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4377.68s)]
*  picker, right? I think over the next five years, I couldn't think of the more interesting time [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4382.64s)]
*  where we're actually going to see dispersion between winners and losers. And do you think [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4388.320000000001s)]
*  that these roll up models make sense? So you've probably heard, and I don't know if you guys have [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4392.96s)]
*  considered this, but obviously some fund managers are putting together pools of capital to go out [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4398.160000000001s)]
*  and buy businesses that they can then apply their know-how, they're bringing smart people in AI [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4403.84s)]
*  to then create a category killer and go after that market. And are you guys participating in that? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4409.68s)]
*  And how do you kind of view that opportunity? Are all the public companies basically too mature [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4416.24s)]
*  or are some of them going to kind of go after this type, this model as well? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4422.08s)]
*  It goes back to whether you can attract the talent to go and do these things. My advice to this large [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4425.2s)]
*  private equity firm is you can probably try to stand up your own AI org, but I suspect you're [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4430.64s)]
*  going to get the person that didn't get an open AI offer, didn't get a meta offer, didn't get a [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4437.04s)]
*  Google offer, didn't get an 80-90 offer, then didn't get an Apple offer, and then that's the [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4441.6s)]
*  person you'll hire. How good that person will be, who the hell knows? I think the problem is that [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4445.68s)]
*  even if you take some of these kind of meh industries and roll them all up, you ultimately [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4451.04s)]
*  have to find a buyer who wants to own that business after you. So the question is like, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4458.96s)]
*  if you were to buy a bunch of accounting firms or law firms or IT services firms, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4463.6s)]
*  and you do an incredible job, who wants to buy that in seven years? Meaning, if you went to the [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4472.0s)]
*  OpenAI demo day, there was this really interesting chart where Andre Carpathy talked about integrating [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4480.240000000001s)]
*  Google login into one of his apps. I think it was his Menyugen app. And the comment he made [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4486.160000000001s)]
*  profoundly hit me is like, why am I doing any of this? Why isn't this just one click behind the [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4493.679999999999s)]
*  scenes? And you could take that generalization and apply it to all of IT services. Why does any of [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4499.5199999999995s)]
*  that exist? Why isn't it all one click? And eventually, if these agents become smart enough, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4505.12s)]
*  the fear that I have is that there is no terminal buyer for many of these companies. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4511.919999999999s)]
*  But they could still be public, Chamath. I mean, they could trade at some multiple of cash flow, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4517.599999999999s)]
*  and you're basically arbitraging the cash flow. But I'm not talking about private equity trade. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4522.72s)]
*  I'm actually talking about the public equity trade. If you look at the 493 companies, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4526.400000000001s)]
*  those are better position. I think like instead of an IT roll up, I think what you could do is [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4531.76s)]
*  probably sort like here's what I would do. I would take the 493. And the filter that I would apply is [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4536.64s)]
*  what offline assets do they have? What online assets do they have? What percentage of those [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4543.52s)]
*  assets are defensible and unique and exist in a post AI world? And what percentage of those assets [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4549.36s)]
*  disappear in a post AI world? And I think where I would end up is I'd like own a specialty chemicals [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4554.639999999999s)]
*  company or something. You're still going to need lubricants and stuff, and you can find some way [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4560.08s)]
*  to make it. But if you're like a feature- We know you need lubricants. Sorry, go ahead. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4565.04s)]
*  I love the lubricants. No ditty. No ditty. But baby oil making, like just- [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4569.44s)]
*  Five by the crate. Do you want to talk about your SPAC tweet? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4577.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, you know the markets back. Can you play the siren? Can you play the siren? [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4580.96s)]
*  Well, as with all my tweets, it starts when- Look, here's what X is an incredible platform. I use it [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4587.92s)]
*  for- Pull up the tweet, Nick. Pull up the tweet. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4599.2s)]
*  I use it for a lot of things. You're in your villain phase right now, man. You're full super villain. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4600.96s)]
*  It's so great. I love it. The retweet is more important. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4605.68s)]
*  I love that. Quote retweet. Here we go. Here's the tweet. Chamath says, incredible, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4609.52s)]
*  that almost 58,000 people voted in his tweet if he should launch a new SPAC. So [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4613.52s)]
*  give the people what they want, Chamath, or what? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4618.8s)]
*  Well, I first started this because I use X sometimes just to sound off because it [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4621.68s)]
*  de-stresses me during the day. And I'll troll people or whatever. And then I just did this. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4628.160000000001s)]
*  And I was so impressed that 58,000 people voted. But really what happened was I had a lot of [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4633.92s)]
*  very smart money people on Wall Street and some crypto folks call me that I respect. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4639.679999999999s)]
*  And basically what they said is like, it would be really good if you did it. So I don't know [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4644.08s)]
*  if I'm going to do it, but I'm heavily leaning towards doing it. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4648.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, the argument to do it is you learned a lot since last time. There's a lot of inventory [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4651.2s)]
*  there. You've got a lot of access to pre-market companies. I think what people need to understand [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4655.04s)]
*  is when you're doing SPACs, and correct me if I'm wrong here- [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4659.36s)]
*  Here's what I'll say, Jason. This poll and this community note will be in every single document [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4662.72s)]
*  I do. Nobody that is listening to this should participate in this. This is going to be for me [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4669.6s)]
*  and a handful of advanced large pools of money. You should stay as far away as possible for [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4674.96s)]
*  whatever I do next. Don't participate in Chamath's next SPAC. That's the rule here. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4682.4800000000005s)]
*  Stay on the sideline. Do something else. Don't come in the arena because we're trying [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4687.68s)]
*  things. Chamath, don't you have enough going on? Why would you do this when you have- [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4691.92s)]
*  Because fate loves irony. Fate loves irony, bro. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4696.08s)]
*  Fate loves irony. It's hilarious. It'll be the greatest IPO of all time. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4698.96s)]
*  If the poll was yes, I'd be like, oh, this is the last thing I need. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4703.12s)]
*  All in SPAC. Let's go. Thomas, commentary? [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4707.28s)]
*  Thomas, are you going to buy the all in SPAC? What's going on? [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4711.52s)]
*  Is the SPAC market coming back? 80, 90 SPAC? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4713.92s)]
*  I'm open to all great companies coming to the public market. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4716.08s)]
*  Love it. Love it. Thomas, can I ask you a question? Tell us about the state of liquidity [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4720.0s)]
*  and actually about IPOs and SPACs in general. Where's your temperature on it? Just give us [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4724.88s)]
*  a read on what you think. Look, I think we're getting real-world data, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4730.24s)]
*  Chamath, in real time. Not just from higher visibility companies like Circle and CoreWeave, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4734.32s)]
*  but Chime also did really well. Keras, a company more in Dave's wheelhouse, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4740.32s)]
*  also just coming out. And then wait till we see the flurry of S1s that have already been filed. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4749.679999999999s)]
*  Figma is a generational potential company that's going to be coming. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4756.96s)]
*  I think we're going to see fantastic assets coming out. I think the market is saying, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4762.24s)]
*  we're open for business. The Max 7 is controversial. To Dave's point, the S&P 493, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4767.44s)]
*  there's going to be lots of winners and losers. It's maybe not as obvious. There's going to be [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4773.44s)]
*  some dispersion. So bring on the new cohort. I think it's the first time you could probably [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4776.879999999999s)]
*  argue that you could go short the S&P and pick a couple of winners. It might be the first time [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4783.2s)]
*  that I would feel in the last 20 years, because I'm pretty negative on people being able to pick [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4788.96s)]
*  stocks. But I do think that this is such a transformative moment that if you really have [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4793.76s)]
*  a sense for what's possible, you could start to see category killers emerge out of the S&P. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4797.92s)]
*  And it's an opportunity to short the S&P and pick a couple of winners. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4802.56s)]
*  Totally. Thomas, do you care about how these companies go public? Do you care about SPAC [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4805.84s)]
*  versus direct listing versus IPO? I don't. I only care about the quality of the underlying asset [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4811.6s)]
*  and what I think it can be worth five years from now. Now, obviously, I do care about the liquidity [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4818.24s)]
*  that I'm getting in the IPO, Chamath. So, you know, am I getting a million or a hundred million or [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4822.96s)]
*  a billion as the float? Right. That's number one. And obviously, I also do care about the percentage [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4829.6s)]
*  that is floating. And I do care about the lockup. Right. So those those three elements are really [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4835.6s)]
*  important in terms of a company going public and how we think about participating. Give the listeners [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4840.32s)]
*  the guidance there. So for the first thing, bigger is better than smaller. Correct. So it's number [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4844.64s)]
*  one. Can I even buy it? Right. If if the IPO is so small and, you know, we can't get a large enough [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4850.64s)]
*  position, it doesn't really make sense for us. Right. So that would be kind of point number one. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4858.320000000001s)]
*  Right. Point number two is how much of the company is publicly floating. Right. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4862.56s)]
*  We believe that there as well. Correct. You kind of get a truer price. Right. When a higher percentage [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4868.4800000000005s)]
*  of the company floats, it's also most likely going to be less bottle and less susceptible, Chamath, [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4874.08s)]
*  to, you know, pricing, predatory pricing and manipulation and things like that. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4880.4s)]
*  What's the percentage float that? I think 20 percent is, in my opinion, kind of a minimum. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4887.679999999999s)]
*  Some have gone out, you know, I think I remember correctly, Chamath, you may know this. I think [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4893.839999999999s)]
*  LinkedIn went out at like 10 percent or something. I remember it being really small. Yeah. And a lot [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4897.92s)]
*  of us thinking like, wow, that is a that is a very controlled float. Yeah. Yeah. Which ended up, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4902.799999999999s)]
*  by the way, being very volatile. So number two, the float and then number three, the lockup. Right. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4907.44s)]
*  First, is there one in a direct listing? There may not be one. Right. So you may you may get in that [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4913.759999999999s)]
*  scenario to a truer price faster. And then why do you think there's been no direct listings? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4919.759999999999s)]
*  Like, why has that totally fallen away after? I mean, Spotify did one, we did one at Slack. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4927.12s)]
*  And then where are they? Like, why? Why don't people pursue those? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4932.0s)]
*  So here's a statistic. I actually had to double check this because I couldn't believe it. Right. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4936.96s)]
*  If you look at the cohort of companies that went IPO in 2021. Right. And and I'm actually [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4942.0s)]
*  not including SPACs in this particular analysis. Right. If you look at that cohort T plus one year, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4947.84s)]
*  the cohort was down about 40 percent on average. Right. OK, fine. Maybe they went up too high. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4956.24s)]
*  Twenty twenty one was a peak. They didn't do well in one year. T plus five years, it's down 50 [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4961.599999999999s)]
*  percent. Right. Which which really kind of shocked me. Right. So I think there's kind of scar tissue [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4966.24s)]
*  on both sides of the table on the buy side about wait, hold on, what am I really buying and how do [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4973.599999999999s)]
*  I make sure that it's kind of a sustainable kind of company? But frankly, probably also from boards, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4979.28s)]
*  right, who are taking their best assets public and may just want to pursue a more conventional [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4986.08s)]
*  approach in the beginning stages. Right. I can tell you for us, direct listing versus IPO makes [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4992.8s)]
*  makes no functional difference. You know, I think each has a benefit. And I think in some, depending [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=4999.679999999999s)]
*  on how concentrated your ownership base is, how understandable your business model is and things [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5004.88s)]
*  like that. But we just want these companies to come. There's a market behavior, by the way, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5010.96s)]
*  in direct listings. And I've mentioned this once, but I've been in two transactions with direct [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5015.04s)]
*  listings. The first was Slack. And in the execution of it, we mis-executed, we meaning me, because I [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5020.16s)]
*  had a huge ownership of Slack, but I didn't know what to do with it. And I ended up distributing [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5027.44s)]
*  portions along the way. And it then went through all kinds of turbulence. And then it got acquired [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5035.2s)]
*  slightly above the IPO price. And what I learned in retrospect was, the best trade is actually the [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5041.12s)]
*  first day trade on a direct listing. So then when it came back around, and I got a distribution the [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5047.919999999999s)]
*  day before of Coinbase, and I mentioned this to Brian, this was not a judgment on the company. I [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5053.28s)]
*  said, if this direct listing process is going to map to what I've experienced at Slack, the right [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5058.0s)]
*  thing to do is to sell. And I sold that on day one at 335 bucks a share. And it's just, it's I think, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5063.5199999999995s)]
*  Jason, it's still not at the IPO price. I think it might be getting close, but no, it's not back. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5072.8s)]
*  So these, yeah, so these direct listings are not what they're attracted to be either. Yeah. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5077.92s)]
*  If we look back on SPACs, I think so far is above the price. And that might have been one [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5082.48s)]
*  of yours for a month. Joe be getting close. These were venture investments. These were [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5086.16s)]
*  late stage venture investments in your mind, Thomas, and then retail tried to become venture [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5090.5599999999995s)]
*  capitalists. And they didn't have the five, 10 year horizon that we as venture capitalists have. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5095.839999999999s)]
*  Is that your assessment of it? And are there any great ones that came out of the SPAC movement? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5100.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, I mean, the direct listing era, as an example, let's talk about Spotify, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5105.44s)]
*  right? Which basically has seven X'd right over that period. So again, I, it's hard to [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5110.4800000000005s)]
*  write causation versus correlation. That's why I'd like, I think ultimately for me as an ultimate [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5118.72s)]
*  kind of long-term owner of these businesses, I really just care about the quality of the business [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5124.0s)]
*  and whether you chose to go SPAC or direct listing or IPO is a mechanical decision. To me, the output [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5128.08s)]
*  is quality of business. And, you know, that's ultimately what wins out. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5135.68s)]
*  Okay. I want to end on this. You just shared a chart of AppLovin and the massive [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5140.64s)]
*  revenue per employee. This is just astounding. Thomas AppLovin, as we can see here, had 3.6 [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5146.4800000000005s)]
*  million revenue per employee in 21. Now up to 7.6 million. They peaked at a thousand employees now [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5151.68s)]
*  down to 750 ish. It looks like in related news, obviously Microsoft, we talked about the other [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5157.4400000000005s)]
*  week, let go of 3%. They are planning on massive cuts again for sales. These are organizations that [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5163.52s)]
*  are at record cash, record revenue in an industry where we had a tradition of not firing the gray [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5168.56s)]
*  beards and people had been at the company for more than 10 years. Andy Jassy didn't come up as like [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5174.56s)]
*  one of the companies we think is going to win at AI, but it might be the company most impacted by [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5179.280000000001s)]
*  deploying AI inside their enterprise. He launched Emissive. Here it is. I suggest everybody read it. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5183.6s)]
*  When you send Emissive like this to your employees, you're trying to communicate something to them [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5190.4800000000005s)]
*  and to the public market. So he published it on his website. He talks about dozens of AI projects, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5194.96s)]
*  AI tools for advertisers, obviously, gen.ai for sellers, you know, their product detail page. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5199.92s)]
*  He's talking about Alexa coming back with a brand new version, shopping assistance, everything. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5206.08s)]
*  But then he started talking about the workforce size. He says in this manifesto, in the next few [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5211.84s)]
*  years, we expect this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5217.84s)]
*  from using AI extensively across the company. So my question to you, Thomas, is when you hear [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5221.84s)]
*  public CEOs talking about lowering the number of employees while they're growing 10, 20% per year, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5229.2s)]
*  this is obviously awesome for earnings, the share price, but there's going to be a massive [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5235.84s)]
*  job displacement. Any thoughts on the job displacement, job replacement, and society [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5241.12s)]
*  navigating that? And just as well, Andy Jassy, specifically, and what you think of Amazon as a [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5246.72s)]
*  business and them being a player in AI and AI being a player in their business? [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5252.400000000001s)]
*  You know, I think it's an important question, and I'll defer to what Jensen answered on this topic, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5258.72s)]
*  because in my view, it's still the most credible and cohesive answer I've kind of heard, right? [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5263.2s)]
*  And Jensen is known, the CEO of Nvidia, an incredibly long term thinker. And in his view, [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5267.6s)]
*  he looks at a population that's getting older, and he wonders who are going to be all the young [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5273.84s)]
*  people that are going to take care of all the old people, whether it's nurses or doctors or other [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5278.400000000001s)]
*  things like that. And in his view, we better get a lot more productive, right, to deal with our [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5282.32s)]
*  inverted demographic table. So I ultimately think this is going to enable more young people to take [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5287.6s)]
*  care of more old people, right? And it's just going to create, I think, knowledge workers are [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5293.52s)]
*  incredibly flexible. They can take their tools from, you know, one particular skill set to another. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5298.32s)]
*  So I think this is going to unleash incredible opportunities for the economy. I think it is going [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5303.52s)]
*  to make us more productive and wealthier. So I'm definitely on the more optimistic side of the [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5309.6s)]
*  scenario. Jamath, any thoughts on Amazon? They didn't come up, but obviously AWS crushing it, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5315.040000000001s)]
*  and they're a major player, and they have their own silicon they're making. You mentioned that [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5322.0s)]
*  being an important part of the stack. And then you have optimists and robots figure that are [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5325.6s)]
*  going to be in their factories. That's a lot of jobs, delivery robots. They're doing drones [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5331.2s)]
*  like Zipline. They have their own version of it, obviously, and they're doing sukes. So if you just [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5336.08s)]
*  look at their behavior and you look at their investments, they're massively, massively investing [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5340.32s)]
*  in robotics, self-driving and chips. So they're pretty hardware focused. Yeah. For physical AI, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5344.639999999999s)]
*  they're a kingmaker in parts because they're a sink for demand. So they'll just generate so [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5350.96s)]
*  much demand for robots. So if figure lands the BMW or the UPS robot successfully, Amazon will buy [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5356.96s)]
*  a gajillion of them. If optimist lands a successful robot that they tune inside the Tesla factory and [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5363.52s)]
*  then are ready to sell, Amazon will buy a gajillion of them. If there are drones that are delivering [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5369.28s)]
*  things, Amazon will buy a gajillion of them. So on the one side, there's a lot of typical Opex lift [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5375.28s)]
*  that Amazon will get. I think the problem is more with AWS, which is that their success is actually [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5381.36s)]
*  their biggest bottleneck. The success is that they are not necessarily kingmaking. They're about [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5386.56s)]
*  being a purveyor of many, many, many different things that you can find inside of AWS marketplace. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5392.88s)]
*  And so the thing that they'll have to embrace is, well, do I differentiate my own hardware from [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5400.080000000001s)]
*  NVIDIAs at some point? Do I actually make a real bet on models and try to frankly buy Anthropic, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5409.6s)]
*  which is probably their only solution, and tightly couple it in and say that if you want to have [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5415.28s)]
*  next generation cogen experiences, they need to run inside of AWS? These are the difficult decisions [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5421.28s)]
*  that I think that Andy will have to face, and he's going to have to spend hundreds of billions of [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5427.2s)]
*  dollars. But yeah, the Amazon retail side is going to be a kingmaker for all of these physical AI [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5431.2s)]
*  things. Freberg, any thoughts on Amazon, just as a company broadly, it's about saying, hey, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5437.28s)]
*  they're a kingmaker. That seems like a really interesting insight. You have any insights there [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5444.48s)]
*  on Amazon and they're playing a part here in the future of AI? I don't. Thomas, any closing thoughts [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5448.16s)]
*  here on the sort of old-guard Microsoft, Amazon, and their employee count and the cuts we're seeing [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5455.919999999999s)]
*  and what these companies will look like in the future in terms of revenue per employee. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5465.28s)]
*  They're not hiring young people. They're getting rid of the old folks. They're just advancing, [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5470.08s)]
*  it seems that they're adopting AI pretty severely at these companies. What are your thoughts there? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5473.84s)]
*  I'm going to play the role of Jcal, and I'm going to ask a question to all three of you guys. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5479.84s)]
*  Oh, here we go. So Microsoft's employee count peaked at about 250,000, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5484.4800000000005s)]
*  call it about a year ago. Who here believes that in five years, Microsoft [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5490.96s)]
*  will have more employees than it does today? More. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5496.8s)]
*  I'm going to say the same. I think they'll have just about 250 plus or minus 10%. I don't think [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5500.56s)]
*  if I could pick push as the answer, I would pick push, which is they're going to get 10% better [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5508.160000000001s)]
*  every year with AI, 20% more efficient. Therefore, they don't need to add people. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5513.200000000001s)]
*  But I also don't think they atrophy much more. So maybe they have 225, 250. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5517.04s)]
*  Why do you say more so quickly? I'm curious. Oh, so this chart, which I think is like a [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5522.4800000000005s)]
*  very dangerous vanity metric, is why. So what Microsoft touts is what percentage of code is [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5528.160000000001s)]
*  generated by AI without answering the more important question, which is, is that code useful and good? [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5536.320000000001s)]
*  And if you ask that second layer, Nick, I sent you this tweet from Jan LeCun, [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5542.88s)]
*  and I'll tell you that this is my lived experience as well, is most code generated by AI is crap. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5547.120000000001s)]
*  And most of the tools that we use, you know, the reason we call these tools app crappers, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5554.08s)]
*  is because most of the code that it generates is crap. So it's great in a single player mode, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5561.28s)]
*  but transitioning from single player mode to a complex enterprise environment is not possible [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5568.48s)]
*  today. So I think that Microsoft puts these metrics out because they want to seem that [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5573.76s)]
*  they're on the front line of it. But I suspect that this is just like, you know, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5580.4800000000005s)]
*  how you used to hire McKinsey consultants to fire people because it was good air cover. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5584.4800000000005s)]
*  It's probably just air cover to fire a bunch of folks that they probably wanted to get rid of [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5588.320000000001s)]
*  anyways. But it's not related to that chart. And the reason is that Jan LeCun's tweet is true. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5592.160000000001s)]
*  When you allow these models to run over complicated tasks over long periods of time, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5597.76s)]
*  the error rates compound to such a degree that the resulting output is not worthwhile. And so [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5603.280000000001s)]
*  until that problem is fixed, which I'm sure it will be, and I'm going to bet that it will be, [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5608.64s)]
*  the idea that all of a sudden it's because of coding agents that people are getting laid off, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5614.88s)]
*  I think is a fallacy. So I suspect that Microsoft business on the margin grows. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5618.96s)]
*  Back to Dave's point, some of the 493 shrink and go away. It'll be cheaper for Microsoft to bundle [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5623.84s)]
*  together a bunch of other products that are point features today. And so they'll have more people, [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5629.200000000001s)]
*  they'll need more, the people will be different, they'll have different skill sets, but I suspect [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5633.200000000001s)]
*  Microsoft's employee base grows. Freeberg, what say you? [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5636.88s)]
*  I think shrink. Wow. So by the way, pretty interesting to think about. We have one [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5641.04s)]
*  decisively more, one medium, about the same, a push and a less. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5646.32s)]
*  I only say that because I do think that there's a real probability of revenue decline in the next [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5652.56s)]
*  five years. So if you look at the enterprise install base, I think that cloud gets competed away. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5658.16s)]
*  So I do think like on the application software layer, they're going to have a really hard time [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5663.2s)]
*  in this new world because the old school customers that buy Microsoft are going to die. They're more [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5668.5599999999995s)]
*  likely to die in their marketplace compared to the folks that are going to build native software, [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5674.16s)]
*  native workflows. And I'm not really where Chamath is. I think you may be right about where AI [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5678.4s)]
*  written code is today. I don't think that that's true three years from now, four years from now, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5683.76s)]
*  given the pace of improvement. And so in a world where you have software [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5688.96s)]
*  written workflows built for you through agentic tools, I think that Microsoft's core business [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5693.04s)]
*  for the is going to decline. The losers are their biggest customers and the winners are not going to [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5699.76s)]
*  use them. So I, you know, that would be- Where are you at Thomas? Maybe you're the tiebreaker. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5704.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm in Chamath camp where I actually think the Microsoft business will be bigger. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5710.64s)]
*  If anything on kind of Azure alone and that at the end of the day, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5714.8s)]
*  we'll just need more people to support it. I just think they'll be more relevant. They'll have more [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5720.0s)]
*  productive employees, but they'll still be more of them. I'm predicting incredible growth and the [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5725.2s)]
*  same number of employees. So you guys are predicting incredible growth and employee growth. I think [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5732.16s)]
*  that that's interesting. So, so sorry, let me ask revenue less employees. Interesting. So the thesis [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5736.56s)]
*  Azure grows is basically where the application dollars go. Effectively is one way to think about [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5742.240000000001s)]
*  this. Right. So application dollars go there and that more than makes up for the decline in that [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5750.400000000001s)]
*  business over time. Right. And there's multiple clouds. By the way, I went to the Google [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5756.64s)]
*  next event last year. And so I ended up going to these like special dinners or whatever, a couple [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5761.4400000000005s)]
*  of cocktail dinner thing, cause I spoke there and I saw they put me with a bunch of these people and [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5767.200000000001s)]
*  CIOs of, you know, whatever fortune 50 companies and all of them said that they're multi-cloud. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5770.88s)]
*  Like they're not, no one's going to standardize on one cloud. So everyone has to be on Microsoft [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5777.04s)]
*  and Google. And I had never really recognized this or thought about this as being a, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5781.4400000000005s)]
*  a fact that it's not necessarily the best or the lowest price. At the end of the day, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5786.0s)]
*  these guys are going to distribute their exposure. And so I think that maybe supports your case. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5790.0s)]
*  I'm very easily, I'm very easily able to see other arguments today. I'm very convinced. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5795.200000000001s)]
*  Here's the revenue. What a spectacular revenue run. Just wow. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5799.2s)]
*  I think all four of us would agree that if we could synthetically own AWS, Azure, and GCP, [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5804.32s)]
*  if I could somehow automagically create an index of all three of those businesses, right? [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5811.12s)]
*  Without anything else. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5816.48s)]
*  Over the next five years, you wouldn't need to own anything else. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5817.36s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5819.92s)]
*  You wouldn't need to own anything else. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5820.48s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5821.36s)]
*  I wish Elon would take that. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5822.08s)]
*  So why don't you put up with the shitty part of the rest of their businesses and just own all three [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5823.28s)]
*  and that's it. Call it a day. Cause you've got to assume that if one of them wins over the other [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5826.8s)]
*  two or accelerates ahead of the other two, it's going to more than make up for the losses that [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5831.84s)]
*  the other two might experience in their other businesses. The multiples aren't crazy on those [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5835.12s)]
*  three companies, by the way. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5838.8s)]
*  Correct. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5839.76s)]
*  Quite reasonable. Yeah. I think if Elon took what he did with Colossus and he had an AWS [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5840.4800000000005s)]
*  competitor, he would be a serious competitor in the space. The velocity at which he can build [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5845.28s)]
*  out data centers is extraordinary. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5850.16s)]
*  This is where Elon does better because he can actually get a better, like, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5852.16s)]
*  fundraising in the private market with XAI than what he has to deal with. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5857.44s)]
*  Yeah. He's really struggling with that. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5862.24s)]
*  No, that's what I'm saying. Yeah. No, I'm saying it's better for him, right? [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5864.72s)]
*  Hey guys, look who's here. Couldn't stay away. David Sachs, look at here. You can't get away [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5867.44s)]

*  czar, David Sachs. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5878.72s)]
*  Good to be back. Jake, where are you? You in LA? [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5880.8s)]
*  I'm in LA. This is- [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5884.08s)]
*  You're at someone's guest house? [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5885.04s)]
*  Yeah. Actually, this is one of your guest houses. You just lost track of them. I still have the [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5886.4800000000005s)]

*  Jato Calen. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5896.08s)]
*  Jato Calen here. I'm here. Come down the hill. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5896.88s)]
*  Did you all still get that reference? It's going to kind of date it now. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5900.16s)]
*  Oh God. Jato Calen is ride or die. I mean, he would jump on a Vente or a Grande for you, for sure. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5902.88s)]
*  Let's talk a little bit here. Since they got you, Sachs, would you be willing to talk a little bit [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5909.44s)]
*  about the Genius Act, which just passed the Senate? I think you have your fingerprints on this. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5912.48s)]
*  Is that true? Yeah. Tell us everything. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5917.12s)]
*  Well, it's definitely something we supported. This is, I think, a huge milestone. What basically [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5920.24s)]
*  happened is we had this Genius Act, which is the stablecoin bill passed the Senate with 68 votes, [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5927.12s)]
*  got 18 Democrats. They came on board. We had to hit that key threshold of 60 votes in the Senate. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5932.88s)]
*  That's the threshold you need in the Senate unless it's a narrow exception for reconciliation. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5939.84s)]
*  It's very, very hard to pass any bill out of the Senate and you need a significant amount of [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5945.84s)]
*  bipartisan support. We got that. Now, when you consider where we were a year ago, you realize [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5950.64s)]
*  what huge progress this is for the crypto industry. A year ago, you had crypto companies [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5958.56s)]
*  being prosecuted. You had this whole regulation through prosecution approach where Gary Gensler [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5964.4800000000005s)]
*  was the chair of the SEC then. He wouldn't tell startups what the rules were, but they would just [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5970.96s)]
*  announce prosecutions. This was driving all the crypto innovation offshore. I think we were [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5974.96s)]
*  basically poised to lose the crypto industry in the United States. What happened then is President [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5980.72s)]
*  Trump adopted this cause. He announced that he wanted to make the United States the crypto [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5985.76s)]
*  capital of the planet. He really campaigned on this. As part of his administration, he in the [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5990.16s)]
*  very first week signed a new executive order making it clear that his administration supported crypto. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=5995.92s)]
*  We've been rooting out all the Biden war on crypto rules and regulations at the agency level. Now, [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6001.52s)]
*  we have this first major legislative win. I would expect the House will act in the next few weeks [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6007.76s)]
*  on this and then the president will have a bill he can sign. This is great work and it's really [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6013.04s)]
*  important because to your point, Gary Gensler's concept was, hey, there's an existing playbook, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6018.4s)]
*  there's existing rules, just follow those. But none of these things actually match the existing [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6023.84s)]
*  rules perfectly. So you need some new rules. They need to evolve. It was much worse than that because [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6028.8s)]
*  he would say things like, well, just come into the SEC and talk to us. So in other words, you got to [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6033.76s)]
*  come in and talk to us and get our approval. But then when startups would go in there and talk to [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6037.92s)]
*  them, there'd be enforcement people there writing down everything they said. And the next day they [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6042.4s)]
*  get a Wells notice and they would get investigated. They were honey-potting, basically. And so the [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6046.5599999999995s)]
*  response to the industry was, okay, we're just going to leave the United States. And that was [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6054.08s)]
*  what was in the process of happening until President Trump won the election and then changed the tone [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6057.679999999999s)]
*  in Washington. I think there was one other really significant thing that happened because obviously [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6061.839999999999s)]
*  President Trump has gotten Republicans on board with this cause, but the question is why are Democrats [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6069.28s)]
*  on board with it? During the Biden administration, Elizabeth Warren really called the shots on crypto [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6074.16s)]
*  and it was well reported that Gensler was sort of her ally in her pick. I've kind of joked that [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6080.4s)]
*  Warren controlled the Biden auto pen on crypto because she really did exert that kind of influence. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6086.5599999999995s)]
*  So the question is, well, what changed? And I think one of the big things is that in this last [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6092.719999999999s)]
*  election, Sherrod Brown, who was the chair of the banking committee for the Democrats in the Senate, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6096.72s)]
*  lost his seat in a close election against Bernie Moreno. And I think there were many reasons for [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6103.280000000001s)]
*  him to lose that seat. He was far to the left of voters in Ohio. Nonetheless, he had been a [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6108.08s)]
*  successful politician there for a long time. And one of the reasons why he lost is because [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6113.04s)]
*  the crypto industry really got behind Bernie Moreno because Sherrod Brown was just a total blocker [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6118.72s)]
*  to any crypto legislation in the mold of Elizabeth Warren. And I think that a lot of smart Democrats [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6125.280000000001s)]
*  looked at that and said, why are we dying on this hill again? You know? Yeah. And I think Sherrod- [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6131.04s)]
*  Well, it's also extraordinarily popular sacks with consumers and businesses. So there is a demand here [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6136.08s)]
*  and Korea- Well, you've got something like 50 million wallet holders in the US and their voters. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6142.320000000001s)]
*  So that's one out of five Americans, adult Americans. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6148.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. So I think a lot of Democrats said, well, wait a second, why are we just blindly [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6150.64s)]
*  following Elizabeth Warren on this? What exactly is so harmful about this? Particularly when what [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6154.0s)]
*  we're talking about here is creating a regulatory regime. You know, it shouldn't be hard to sell [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6158.88s)]
*  Democrats on new regulations. But in this case, the reason why there's broad bipartisan support [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6164.24s)]
*  is because the crypto industry itself is calling for those regulations because having regulatory [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6170.96s)]
*  certainty is better for them than the possibility of the return of a Gary Gensler like figure who [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6176.88s)]
*  just prosecutes them without telling them what the rules are. So this is why I think you're getting [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6182.56s)]
*  some significant bipartisan support. And as you said, bringing this on shore [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6187.120000000001s)]
*  is such a great portion of it. There are tons of actors who some people might describe as bad or [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6192.400000000001s)]
*  gray or dark tether comes to mind with a lot of regulation against it. And now those folks who [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6198.4800000000005s)]
*  are running away with the industry, Thomas, now they have to compete with people like Jeremy [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6205.120000000001s)]
*  O'Leary and Circle, which are totally buttoned up here in the United States, and it levels the [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6210.0s)]
*  playing field. So it's an example of actually good regulation, bringing this opportunity back on shore [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6213.92s)]
*  and taking it out of the gray area. Just on the whole offshore versus onshore. So it is true that [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6220.32s)]
*  the number one stable coin issuer on the planet right now is an offshore company. And that is [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6226.32s)]
*  partly because there has not been a regulatory framework in the U.S. and there's been hostility [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6232.24s)]
*  towards the crypto space. And so the logical reaction to that is to either not get involved [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6238.4800000000005s)]
*  in the crypto space, which is what the banks have done until now, or you go offshore. Neither one is [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6245.84s)]
*  good. And you can see in the wake of this genius act, the stable coin bill, that the banks have now [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6250.88s)]
*  talked about getting into stable coins. They're going to issue one. And then also tether will, [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6257.52s)]
*  under this act, will have three years to come onshore. But the bottom line is they will have [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6263.12s)]
*  to operate in the United States. And that's a good thing for consumers is a good thing. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6267.76s)]
*  Oh, they gave them three years to get compliance. They have three years, but they have to move on [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6272.88s)]
*  shore. Now, all stable coin issuers under this bill will have to be audited quarterly. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6276.32s)]
*  And real audit, not this attestation nonsense, like real audits by American. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6282.8s)]
*  Real audits. And it will verify that every stable coin that's been issued is backed [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6287.68s)]
*  or fully reserved on a one to one basis with real dollars in an American bank accounts that are in [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6293.92s)]
*  U.S. T bills or money market accounts. And so what it does is, by the way, I'm not saying [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6300.88s)]
*  there's anything wrong with tether, but this does provide additional certainty and confidence [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6306.5599999999995s)]
*  because you know that all the companies are onshore and they've been fully audited. And we [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6312.0s)]
*  know that they're fully reserved so that when you want to redeem and cash out your [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6318.08s)]
*  stable coin tokens, there's a real dollar waiting there to cash out. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6322.64s)]
*  You prevent the under collateral ization issue. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6326.64s)]
*  Yeah. And by the way, I'm not saying that there is, but what I'm saying is now we create total [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6330.08s)]
*  certainty and confidence, which is good for the market. What happens if a stable coin issuer does [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6335.28s)]
*  not, like, can you issue U.S. dollar stable coins and not be governed under this system? Or no, [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6339.92s)]
*  you're saying because the U.S. dollar is a U.S. government instrument, then no matter where you [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6346.4s)]
*  are or no matter where you issue from. Yeah. All the issuers will be governed by this. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6350.72s)]
*  And if you're a legacy offshore issuer, you're given this time period to [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6355.2s)]
*  bring yourself into conformity. But yeah. Otherwise what happens if they don't? [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6359.04s)]
*  Well, it's a good question. I mean, I guess the exchanges won't be able to carry their tokens. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6364.72s)]
*  And they won't be able to set foot in the U.S. They'll be in violation of U.S. laws. It's not a [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6370.8s)]
*  good place to be. Yeah. I mean, you don't have to guess. There have been dozens of actions and [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6374.32s)]
*  accusations like legitimate ones against Tether. New York's attorney general did a major settlement [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6380.72s)]
*  with him in 2021. They've been banned from many jurisdictions and Senate hearings. Tether should [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6385.28s)]
*  just go public in America and be done with it. Well, and the issue was there was deep concerns [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6393.2s)]
*  that they didn't have the deposits. And now they're really trumpeting the fact that they're [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6398.48s)]
*  massively profitable, obviously. So there's been tons of, you can just search Tether and [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6403.2s)]
*  allegations and you'll find all that stuff in order to reach it here. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6408.32s)]
*  Tether founders of time. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6411.2s)]
*  Sax, I got to give you a lot of credit. We knew that you would bring an efficiency level [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6412.879999999999s)]
*  and some expertise to this administration, but I got to give you your flowers. We're five months [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6417.679999999999s)]
*  into this administration. I disagree about many things. One thing we can't disagree about is that [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6421.5199999999995s)]
*  this piece of legislation is here and we're only five months in. So maybe you could speak [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6426.72s)]
*  to the velocity at which things are getting done and then any other closing thoughts. I know you [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6432.0s)]
*  got to get back to your day job. Jake, a lot of people deserve credit for this. I just want to [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6437.6s)]
*  give out a couple of shout outs. So Senator Bill Haggerty from Tennessee was the principal author [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6440.96s)]
*  of the legislation. He did an amazing job getting Democrat votes and also bringing the Senate bill [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6445.280000000001s)]
*  into greater alignment with the House bill. So hopefully this can pass the House very quickly. [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6450.72s)]
*  Chairman Tim Scott is the chairman of the banking committee, was also incredible. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6455.04s)]
*  The majority leader, John Thune. And then we had a few co-sponsors of the legislation, [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6459.36s)]
*  Cynthia Lemmis from Wyoming. And then two Democrats actually were really important, [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6464.88s)]
*  Kirsten Gillibrand from New York and Angela Alston Brooks from Maryland. All of them did a great job [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6468.799999999999s)]
*  and we've got great leaders on the House side as well. French Hill, who's the chairman of the House [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6473.04s)]
*  Financial Services Committee. Tom Emmer, who's the whip and Mike Johnson, who's the speaker. So [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6476.96s)]
*  kudos to all of them because I think that it really is a pretty incredible achievement that [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6482.64s)]
*  they've been able to get this bill through. Again, just a huge sea change from where we were a year [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6487.52s)]
*  ago where crypto was basically under attack. It was being driven offshore and now we have it as [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6492.320000000001s)]
*  one of the first major piece of legislation by this new Congress. And again, that's all because [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6497.76s)]
*  of President Trump's leadership and prioritization of this issue. So thank you to all of them for [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6502.240000000001s)]
*  making this happen. Congratulations to you, David. Hey, one tactical question I forgot to ask you. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6506.72s)]
*  The float on these, this is like how Tether is making billions of dollars a year and this is how [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6511.68s)]
*  people anticipate they're going to make billions of dollars a year. Are they able to split that with [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6515.4400000000005s)]
*  consumers yet? Because I remember reading in early legislation that you weren't allowed to pass on [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6519.52s)]
*  the interest made from a stablecoin to like the consumers, I guess. So it couldn't be an [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6525.200000000001s)]
*  interest-bearing account. If you buy stablecoins, you can't get interest on it, but the issuer like [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6531.200000000001s)]
*  Circle, that's their main business model. So did that make it into the final? And maybe you can [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6534.400000000001s)]
*  give us some background on that. No, no, it did not. The way the framework works is that the [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6538.88s)]
*  stablecoin issuers cannot pass on interest to the token holders. Why is that? Look, I mean, I don't [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6544.400000000001s)]
*  know if there's a great principled reason. This was a compromise that was necessary to get the [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6549.92s)]
*  support of the banking industry, quite frankly. Ah, they see it as competition, I'm betting. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6554.32s)]
*  Well, there was a lot of concern from community banks that if stablecoins were paying 5% interest, [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6558.4800000000005s)]
*  it would put them out of business. Personally, I think that that concern, although understandable [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6563.28s)]
*  from them, I don't think that that's what would have happened. But these are the types of [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6568.5599999999995s)]
*  compromises, quite frankly, that you need in order to pass legislation. I hope that at some point in [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86t6YNf_B7Q&t=6573.12s)]
