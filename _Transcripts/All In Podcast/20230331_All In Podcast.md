# E122 Is AI the next great computing platform? ChatGPT vs. Google, containing AGI & RESTRICT Act
**All In Podcast:** [March 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ)
*  Oh, Jake, how's here? Hello, Jake. Hey, hurry. Thanks for showing [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  up. I've been here the whole time. I was just, I was just [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3.0s)]
*  having some of these beautiful salted roasted sashes. The only [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  problem is when I went to the store, I kid you not, there was [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=11.28s)]
*  a shelf of these all flavors available except one flavor, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  salt and vinegar, see salt and vinegar tire, we move the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=17.92s)]
*  market, we move the market. I am not kidding. I go to the fancy, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=21.28s)]
*  you know, bespoke, really, he went to the railings and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=27.56s)]
*  trucking. I went to the railings and trucking the artisanal. And [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=30.2s)]
*  they have, you know, all these overpriced all it's called [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  artisanal. That's what I said, the art stuff, the artistic [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=35.96s)]
*  food, the artisanal row where they had this. I kid you not [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  spicy, salty, no salt, every shelf packed, then there's one [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  shelf I can see straight through to the ice cream but not see [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=51.96s)]
*  salt and vinegar and I look at the tiny little sign salt and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=54.8s)]
*  vinegar, shelled nuts, sea salt and sea salt and vinegar, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=57.919999999999995s)]
*  chamats, shelled nuts sold out across the country. You know, I [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=62.199999999999996s)]
*  cannot recommend these more highly. They're incredible. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=66.0s)]
*  You can't recommend your salty nuts. They are delicious. My [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=68.96s)]
*  salty nuts are delicious. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=72.8s)]
*  Did you see Joe Manchin's high heater op-ed in the Wall Street [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=84.8s)]
*  Journal? Oh, oh my god. Yep, Joe Manchin went for it. Joe [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=89.0s)]
*  Manchin is running for president. He is, I think. Okay, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  so let me ask Sachs right there. Sachs, Joe Manchin, Nikki Halley, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=96.92s)]
*  and who's the guy from Florida? That's your question. By the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=101.84s)]
*  way, there's a big defection that was leaked this week. Ron [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=104.44s)]
*  louder flipped from the top of the list. I think it was a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=108.12s)]
*  big defection that was leaked this week. Ron louder flipped [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=110.64s)]
*  from Trump to to Santus. That's a big one because louder is good [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=114.72s)]
*  for a lot of money, five to 10 million, at least. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=117.56s)]
*  Joe Manchin, what impact would he have coming into the race? I'm [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=120.6s)]
*  not trolling you. Looking for your honest opinion. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=122.92s)]
*  Well, it depends how he comes in. What did he say in the op-ed? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=124.68s)]
*  He was talking about the insincerity of the Biden [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=127.44s)]
*  administration to control costs and how everybody was [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=129.2s)]
*  incompetent. And it certainly there's some waste and we can [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=131.32s)]
*  control some spending and everybody needs to grow up and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=133.84s)]
*  get in a room and just manage the budget for the American [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=135.68s)]
*  people and stop playing politics. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=139.04s)]
*  I think the headline of the article actually to your point [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=140.2s)]
*  J. Cal was much worse than the substance of the article, Saks. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=142.76s)]
*  But if you see the headline, I don't know, Nick, if you can [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=145.68s)]
*  just throw it up there. It was brutal. The headline and the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=147.35999999999999s)]
*  byline of the article, I think was more damaging than the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=151.04s)]
*  substance of the article. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=153.72s)]
*  Biden's Inflation Reduction Act betrayal, instead of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=155.48s)]
*  implementing the law as intended, his administration [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=158.44s)]
*  subverts it for ideological ideological ends. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=160.84s)]
*  I have to think that Joe was responsible for that for the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=164.12s)]
*  titling of that article. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=166.32s)]
*  He would get permission to approve it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=167.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=169.92s)]
*  And by the way, I think if you guys remember, we talked about [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=171.04s)]
*  this when that act was first published. And if you guys [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=174.4s)]
*  remember, I think I pulled up the CBO data, the CBO model, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=177.2s)]
*  and it showed for the first five years, this thing burns a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=180.84s)]
*  couple hundred billion dollars. And then there's some [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=183.32s)]
*  expectation that there'll be some sudden boom in revenue in [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=185.56s)]
*  the out years. And then you make the money back in the out [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=188.64s)]
*  years. So it's total like accounting shenanigans for him [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=190.88s)]
*  have made the claim in the first place, that the IRA was [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=194.28s)]
*  actually going to be like a net deficit reduction or debt [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=196.96s)]
*  reduction. In fact, it's all just accounting shenanigans. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=199.52s)]
*  And it's just a massive spend package, particularly in the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=201.96s)]
*  near term when it matters most. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=205.36s)]
*  I think I told you guys this, but I think this was like, when [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=206.56s)]
*  was the last time I was in Washington, probably, what is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=209.24s)]
*  it March now? So maybe it was January I was there. And I saw [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=211.56s)]
*  Schumer and Mark Warner and I spent about two hours with [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=217.8s)]
*  Manchin. He is really impressive. He's cool. He's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=221.52s)]
*  interesting. He's thoughtful. He's moderate. Manchin's like a [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  formidable guy. So this will be really interesting if he steps [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  in there and tries to take on [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=235.16000000000003s)]
*  Nikki Haley and Manchin. Where do you write your check? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=236.68s)]
*  I'd probably write a check to both to be honest. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=239.28s)]
*  Feels like a good ticket to me. I've always wanted to see the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  crossfire. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  Could you imagine a Democrat and Republican merging somehow and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=244.4s)]
*  like running together? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  It would be the greatest. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=248.52s)]
*  My God, I've been pitching that for years. I think that's like a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=249.56s)]
*  my god clear path. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=252.68s)]
*  David Friedberg may have just come up with one of the most [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=254.52s)]
*  disruptive ideas in American politics that's ever been [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  floated. Oh, my God. Manchin, Halley, Halley, Manchin, Halley. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=259.52s)]
*  Just my comment on this. So first of all, I remember when [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=264.48s)]
*  you know, Manchin did a good job stopping Biden's three and a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=267.48s)]
*  half trillion dollar build back better. Remember, it was him and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=269.92s)]
*  Sinema that were the holdouts. Yeah, but then Manchin [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=272.32s)]
*  compromised and gave Biden a $750 billion version of it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=275.52s)]
*  And I guess now he's complaining that Biden didn't live up to his [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=279.59999999999997s)]
*  end of the bargain and doing the deficit reduction. But quite [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=282.84s)]
*  frankly, many commentators said at the time that the bills claims [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=285.03999999999996s)]
*  to deficit reduction were preposterous and that would [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=289.96s)]
*  never happen. So quite frankly, you know, Manchin shouldn't have [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  been euchered or hoodwinked by Biden. Everyone was basically [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=296.52s)]
*  saying there'll never be any deficit reduction out of this [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=299.56s)]
*  bill. It's just more spending. So I don't really feel bad for [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=301.68s)]
*  Manchin here saying that somehow he was betrayed by Biden, he [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=305.68s)]
*  should have known better. Now, in terms of him running. Yeah, I [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=308.2s)]
*  think as a Democrat who's figured out how to get himself [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=312.44s)]
*  elected in West Virginia, which is a plus 20 red state, he [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=315.4s)]
*  obviously knows how to appeal to the center. The problem for him [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=319.12s)]
*  is just how do you get the Democratic Party nomination? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=321.4s)]
*  Because he's far to the right of your average Democratic Party [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=324.88s)]
*  voter. If he wants to run as an independent, that's a different [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=328.2s)]
*  story. And that would really throw a curveball into the race. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=330.96s)]
*  But I don't see him doing that. I think it's kind of a stretch. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=334.4s)]
*  And this is the problem with a lot of these fantasy candidates [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=337.68s)]
*  is that, you know, centrist or moderate voters might like them, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=340.48s)]
*  but they can't get the nomination their party. And [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=344.64s)]
*  unless you mean like Trump and Obama, those were fantasy [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=346.64s)]
*  candidates. I don't think so. I mean, Trump was not a fantasy [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=348.8s)]
*  candidate is the ultimate. Well, he was an outsider, but he [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=351.56s)]
*  appeals to the base of the party. He appealed to the base [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  of the party. What I'm saying is in order to get the nomination [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=356.36s)]
*  of a major party, you have to appeal to its base. And I don't [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=358.76s)]
*  think Manchin appeals to the base Democratic Party is out of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  step with it. He's out of step with it in ways that I like, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=364.84s)]

*  feels like he's in a good mood. I like this. Welcome to the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=458.88s)]
*  world's greatest podcast. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=461.92s)]
*  Open AI launched a bunch of chat GPT plugins. And I don't know if [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=465.16s)]
*  you saw it. But David Sachs wrote a blog post with chat GPT. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=470.36s)]
*  It's an amazing back and forth. I read this back and forth. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=474.84s)]
*  Explain what you did, Sachs. This was really like one of the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=478.88s)]
*  best conversations I've seen with chat GPT. I'll pop it up [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=482.71999999999997s)]
*  here on the screen. But [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  well, I had an idea for a blog post about the use of a, I guess, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=488.44s)]
*  tactic you could call gift to get. I thought it would be an [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=494.28s)]
*  interesting tactic for AI startups to use if they're trying [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=497.88s)]
*  to get a hold of proprietary training data. So for example, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=501.56s)]
*  if you want to create an architect AI, you need a lot of [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=504.72s)]
*  plans. Or if you're going to create like a doctor AI, you [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=508.24s)]
*  need a lot of lab results or medical reports to train the AI [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=511.96s)]
*  on and those are hard to get. Open AI doesn't necessarily have [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=515.72s)]
*  them yet. So there is an opportunity, I think, for [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=518.48s)]
*  startups to create these AIs and different, you call them [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=520.52s)]
*  professional verticals. So the gift to get technique would be, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=524.92s)]
*  you give points to your users for uploading that data. And [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=528.96s)]
*  then they can spend those points by using the AI. And anyway, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=532.96s)]
*  that the company that came up with this gift to get tactic was [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=535.8000000000001s)]
*  a company called Jigsaw. Almost 20 years ago, no one remembers [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=539.08s)]
*  this company, I'm kind of dating myself because I remembered it. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=542.9200000000001s)]
*  But I just had this idea, gee, I wonder if the Jigsaw approach [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=545.6s)]
*  could be used for AI startups. So I started by going into chat [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=548.5600000000001s)]
*  GPT. And I said, Hey, have you heard of Jigsaw? And then it [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=552.72s)]
*  had. And then I said, tell me about its gift to get, you know, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=556.12s)]
*  approach. And then I said, would this approach work for AI [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=559.68s)]
*  startups that want proprietary training data sets? And I said, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=563.96s)]
*  yes, this is a good idea. And then I gave the architect [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=568.2s)]
*  example. And I said, can you give me more examples like this? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=571.28s)]
*  And it gave me like 20 more examples. And then I asked it [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=573.64s)]
*  just to flesh out various kinds of details. I went down some [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=577.16s)]
*  cul-de-sacs that didn't use. And then at the end, I said, can you [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=579.92s)]
*  summarize everything we've just talked about in a blog post? And [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=583.32s)]
*  it gave me the first draft of a blog post. I then did a [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=586.08s)]
*  substantial amount of editing on most of the blog posts, although [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=589.2s)]
*  some of it I just use verbatim. And then I had a couple of [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=592.6800000000001s)]
*  people in my firm look at it, they made some good suggestions. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=595.08s)]
*  So it's not like the humans completely out of the loop. And [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=597.44s)]
*  then I copy and pasted my edited version back into chat GPT said, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=600.4000000000001s)]
*  here's my edit. And then I asked for some suggestions and made a [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=604.0400000000001s)]
*  few small edits. And I said, okay, great, just incorporate [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=607.5200000000001s)]
*  the edits yourself gave me that final output. And then I posted [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=611.2s)]
*  on substack, a blog that probably would have taken me a [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=614.36s)]
*  week to research and write if I'd done it at all, I was able to [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=617.08s)]
*  do in a day. And I can't see myself going back now. I think [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=621.32s)]
*  this is just how I'm going to write all my blog posts is is [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=625.32s)]
*  use chat GPT as my researcher, as a writing partner, some cases [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=628.92s)]
*  an editor, but I'm definitely gonna run it through. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=635.44s)]
*  The thing that I was struck by was just how kind and generous [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=638.5600000000001s)]
*  and thoughtful this conversation was. And I just [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=643.48s)]
*  thought I've never seen sacks have a conversation where he was [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=645.64s)]
*  so kind to the other person and thoughtful. Right about now all [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=648.04s)]
*  your friends and family are like, how do we get sacks to [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=650.9200000000001s)]
*  have this conversation with us? You were super kind to the AI. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=652.76s)]
*  Because it's not a person. It was a robot. Oh, well, just in [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=656.72s)]
*  case it takes over the world, Jake, how you can't be too too [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=660.9200000000001s)]
*  careful. But no, I think listen, it's important to give the AI [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=663.6s)]
*  so perfect. Perfect. Thanks. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=666.96s)]
*  I've never once gotten a thanks from [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=671.08s)]
*  such an example. Actually, scroll up and show that example. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  The AI actually gave me some information about jigsaws point [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=676.72s)]
*  system. Again, the rewards that they used. Yeah, and it was just [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=680.32s)]
*  in text. So I said down below, hey, can you spit that out as a [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=684.48s)]
*  table? And it did instantly. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=687.6s)]
*  It's like a day's work, right? Like you would have to have an [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=690.0s)]
*  analyst or researcher do a day's work. It's incredible. And then [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=691.96s)]
*  I just screenshot of that. And I made it an exhibit. Thank you. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=694.72s)]
*  Well, it was like delightful back to you. I mean, this is this [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=698.84s)]
*  is a literal road to you. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=702.44s)]
*  All the money that you've spent on therapy and just trying [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=707.92s)]
*  coaching to be nice to people. You're just nice naturally. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=711.72s)]
*  It's in a good mood today. I don't know why you're [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=716.6s)]
*  he's laughing. Come on. It's funny. Thank you to the AI. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=719.32s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=724.04s)]
*  This is confirmatory of what we know. David wants to live in a [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=725.2s)]
*  set of highly transactional relationships, ideally with a [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=728.5600000000001s)]
*  machine. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=731.96s)]
*  Who can then eventually help make him money? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=735.24s)]
*  Can I ask a question of sincerity, sex? Did you What did [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=737.48s)]
*  you enjoy more working with your team of humans on this or working [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=740.2s)]
*  with chat GPT? Which one was more enjoyable for you? Just [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=744.64s)]
*  personal? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=748.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, I think they're both were I would say that the human [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=750.28s)]
*  contributions were essential. So basically, it's not about [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=753.52s)]
*  enjoyment. It's just you know, it's about this is just a job to [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=758.8s)]
*  get done. But but it definitely spent things up enormously. I [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=761.28s)]
*  personally find the hardest part of writing a blog is when you're [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=765.1999999999999s)]
*  staring at that blank sheet of paper, and just having to like [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=767.88s)]
*  spit out the first 1000 words. Yes, it's just so time consuming [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=771.16s)]
*  to do that. But again, if you start with the first draft, even [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=775.0799999999999s)]
*  if it's not very good, then you can just edit it and it speaks [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=778.4s)]
*  up a lot. Yeah, it's great for ideation. But the people in my [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=781.92s)]
*  firm were important. Yeah. I actually trusted it. I know that [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=785.52s)]
*  you probably should fact check it in a way because it can [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=789.8s)]
*  hallucinate. But the things that we're saying made so much sense [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=792.88s)]
*  to me that I didn't think it was hallucinating. Well, this is a [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=795.4s)]
*  great moment to pivot into what open AI did with plugins. These [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=798.3199999999999s)]
*  came fast and furious this week. And a bunch of folks who had, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=803.12s)]
*  you know, started verticalized chat GPT based projects, MVPs [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=806.3199999999999s)]
*  were like, oh, maybe my project MVP is now dead. Because [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=811.64s)]
*  Instacart, OpenTable, Shopify, Slack, Zapier, and Zapier, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=816.64s)]
*  obviously, like if then this then that is a very wide raging [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=820.04s)]
*  tool that allows you to connect API's from a multitude of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=824.28s)]
*  sources. And what this all lets you do at the end of the day is [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=828.56s)]
*  have chat GPT ping one of these sources, just like an app might [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=832.1999999999999s)]
*  do or some custom software might do ping the API and return data. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=837.08s)]
*  So hey, what tables are open on OpenTable? Maybe Shopify, find [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=843.8000000000001s)]
*  me things to buy in this category, etc. And so people [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=849.84s)]
*  have started building little scripts, we used to call these [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=853.64s)]
*  when magic leap was out internet agents. And the concept of a [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=857.5200000000001s)]
*  software agent that's existed for a long time actually, in [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=862.84s)]
*  computer science, I'm sure FreeBricket will give us some [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=866.88s)]
*  examples of that. But also chat GPT can now use a browser. So [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=868.9200000000001s)]
*  that means you can get around the dated nature of the content [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=872.6800000000001s)]
*  in the corpus. Somebody did things like, hey, build me a [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=876.72s)]
*  meal plan, book me a reservation for Friday night in OpenTable, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=880.24s)]
*  source other ingredients and buy it for Saturday night on [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=883.72s)]
*  Instacart, and then use something like WolframAlpha to, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=885.96s)]
*  you know, calculate the calories, etc. So when you saw [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=890.32s)]
*  this drop, Sax, what did you think in terms of the opportunity [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=893.76s)]
*  for startups and to build these intelligent agents things that [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=899.3199999999999s)]
*  will do if then if this then that, or just background tasks [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=904.5999999999999s)]
*  over time, and you could actually leave them running. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=909.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think this is the most important developer [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=912.0s)]
*  platform since the iPhone and the launch of iOS in the App [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=914.7199999999999s)]
*  Store. And I would argue maybe ever in our industry, certainly [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=919.1999999999999s)]
*  since the beginning of the internet, I think there was a [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=923.48s)]
*  question when chat GPT launched on November 30, and people start [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=925.2s)]
*  playing within December, what exactly OpenAI's product [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=930.04s)]
*  strategy was going to be? Was this just like a proof of concept [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=934.0s)]
*  or a demo? And they even kind of called it like a demo. And [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=937.5600000000001s)]
*  initially, it looked like what their business model was going [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=942.6s)]
*  to be was providing an intelligence API that other [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=944.88s)]
*  websites, other applications could incorporate. And we saw [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=948.76s)]
*  some really cool demos like that notion demo of other [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=952.08s)]
*  applications incorporating AI capabilities. And so initially, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=955.8000000000001s)]
*  it looked like what OpenAI was going to be was more like Stripe [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=959.0s)]
*  where in the same way that Stripe made payments [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=963.72s)]
*  functionality available very easily through a developer [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=966.9200000000001s)]
*  platform, they were going to make AI capabilities available [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=968.88s)]
*  through their developer platform. And then I think a [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=972.6s)]
*  funny thing happened on the way to this announcement, which is [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=975.1600000000001s)]
*  they became the fastest growing application of all time talking [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=978.32s)]
*  about chat GPT, over 100 million users in two months, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=981.56s)]
*  nobody else has ever done that before. I think it took the [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=985.1199999999999s)]
*  iPhone, you know, two years plus, Gmail, Google, those [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=987.28s)]
*  products all took, I think, well over a year. So this became the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=992.68s)]
*  fastest growing site of all time. And I think with plugins, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=996.0s)]
*  what they're indicating is that they will become a destination [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1000.1999999999999s)]
*  site. This is not just a developer platform, this is a [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1003.16s)]
*  destination site. And through plugins, they are now [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1005.56s)]
*  incorporating the ability to basically, you know, anything you [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1008.6s)]
*  could do through an application, you will now be able to do [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1014.08s)]
*  through a plugin, you'll just tell chat GPT what you want [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1016.6s)]
*  done if you say, hey, book me a plane ticket on this date, it [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1020.2s)]
*  will go into kayak's plugin and do that. You say, book me a [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1023.4s)]
*  plane ticket and then an Airbnb [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1026.56s)]
*  for the [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1027.88s)]
*  promise of Siri and Alexa realized because those were very [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1028.24s)]
*  rigid, they had no intelligence, right? Friedberg, you if you if [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1033.28s)]
*  you wanted Siri to do something specific, like use ways, or to go [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1036.96s)]
*  get you an open table, it needed to be pretty specific. And it [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1040.92s)]
*  didn't have any kind of natural language model behind it. So this [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1044.16s)]
*  is taking existing API's and putting a natural language layer [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1048.44s)]
*  in front of it, which makes it, you know, perform a little more [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1051.68s)]
*  naturally. Is that what we're seeing here? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1055.66s)]
*  I think it provides access to a corpus of data and a suite of [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1057.8400000000001s)]
*  services that are not well integrated into a search or chat [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1063.36s)]
*  interface anywhere today. So, you know, knowing what restaurants [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1068.4399999999998s)]
*  have what seats available is in a closed service, it's in a data [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1073.6s)]
*  warehouse, operated by open table. And now what open table [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1077.24s)]
*  can do is provide an API into that data via an interface and [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1081.28s)]
*  they can allow chat GPT to make a request to figure that data [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1085.4399999999998s)]
*  out to give a response to a user. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1089.4799999999998s)]
*  Where they can ultimately benefit from transacting and [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1093.3999999999999s)]
*  allowing a service. This closes the loop between search and [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1096.6799999999998s)]
*  commerce in a way that Google cannot and does not do today. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1101.6s)]
*  And I think that's what makes it very powerful. We've seen this [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1106.6s)]
*  attempted in a number of important ways in the last [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1109.3999999999999s)]
*  couple of years with Alexa, and Apple home and Google home kind [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1111.6399999999999s)]
*  of integration via the chat services that they offer, you [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1115.3999999999999s)]
*  know, where you speak to the device, but the deep integration [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1120.44s)]
*  that's possible now, and the natural language way that you [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1123.44s)]
*  can go from the request all the way through to the transaction [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1126.96s)]
*  is what makes this so extremely powerful. And I think, you know, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1130.48s)]
*  the points I made a few weeks ago, when we first talked about, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1134.52s)]
*  you know, search, having so many searches that are done, where [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1137.96s)]
*  the human computer interface presents a table or presents a [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1141.72s)]
*  chart, or presents a shopping list in a matrix. That's what [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1145.92s)]
*  makes search such a defensible product, I think could [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1149.36s)]
*  theoretically be completely obviated or destroyed with an [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1153.08s)]
*  interface like this, where you can write the ability for chat [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1156.24s)]
*  GPT or whatever the core centralized services to actually [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1160.52s)]
*  present results in a table in a matrix in an interface in a [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1164.08s)]
*  shopping list, and actually close the transaction loop. It's [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1167.6s)]
*  really disruptive to things like commerce providers, it's really [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1171.52s)]
*  disruptive, you know, some of these commerce platforms, it's [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1174.76s)]
*  really disruptive to a lot of different industries, but also [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1177.24s)]
*  introduces a lot of real opportunity to build on top of [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1180.04s)]
*  that capability and that functionality to rewrite, and [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1183.52s)]
*  ultimately make things easier and better for consumers on the [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1186.28s)]
*  internet. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1188.72s)]
*  What do you think Chamath, you're looking at this, and it [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1189.16s)]
*  seems to be moving at a very fast pace, over 100 million [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1191.84s)]
*  users, they put a business model on it already 20 bucks a month, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1194.96s)]
*  they have a secondary business model of, hey, use the API, and [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1198.36s)]
*  we'll charge you for usage. And then you layer on what's [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1202.04s)]
*  going on in the world, and you go into Zapier, and if this [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1204.76s)]
*  then that had already sort of established in the world, which [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1207.76s)]
*  is API's, but nobody ever really wanted to write scripts. So that [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1210.76s)]
*  seemed to be the blocker, you go into Zapier, if this and that, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1214.8s)]
*  it's worth 5% of the audience, people want to customize stuff, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1218.16s)]
*  people who want to tinker. But this seems to now with the chat [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1220.68s)]
*  GPT chat interface, open it up to a lot of people. So is this [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1223.36s)]
*  super significant? Or is this a commodity product that, you [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1227.08s)]
*  know, 10 people will have, we're sitting here next year on all in [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1230.24s)]
*  the world, and we're going to be talking about the [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1233.24s)]
*  blocker. And you are asking the exact right question and you use [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1235.24s)]
*  the great term, like in poker, if there are three hearts on the [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1239.1200000000001s)]
*  board, and you have the ace of hearts, you have what's called [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1243.32s)]
*  the nut blocker, right, which means that nobody else, even if [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1249.48s)]
*  anybody else has a flush, they never have the best flush. And [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1253.48s)]
*  if flush is the best hand, there's a lot of ways that you [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1256.6s)]
*  can manipulate the pot and eventually win the pot because [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1259.28s)]
*  the concept of blocker, I think is very important to understand [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1261.8s)]
*  here, which is what are the real blockers for this capability to [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1266.72s)]
*  not be broadly available. So I think you have to segregate, you [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1270.8799999999999s)]
*  have the end user destination, you have the language model, and [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1275.44s)]
*  then you have the third party services. And so if you ask the [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1280.84s)]
*  question, what is the incentive of the third party service? [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1283.8799999999999s)]
*  The shareholders of a travel site, right? They're not [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1286.52s)]
*  interested in doing an exclusive deal with any distribution [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1293.9199999999998s)]
*  endpoint, they want their services integrated as broadly [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1296.6399999999999s)]
*  as possible. Right? So I think the the answer for the service [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1299.28s)]
*  providers is just like they build an app for iOS and for [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1303.36s)]
*  Google. And, you know, if they could have justified it, they [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1307.7199999999998s)]
*  would have built an app for a gaming console, they can, they [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1310.3999999999999s)]
*  do. Right? So that's going to get commoditized and broadly [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1314.4s)]
*  available. I think on the LLM side, I think we've talked about [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1318.3600000000001s)]
*  this. Everybody's converging on each other. In fact, there was [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1322.04s)]
*  an interesting article that was released that said that there [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1326.0s)]
*  was a handful of Google engineers that quit because [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1330.64s)]
*  apparently Bard was actually learning on top of chat GPT, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1333.16s)]
*  which they felt was either legal or unethical or something, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1340.72s)]
*  right? So, so the point is, I think we've talked about this [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1345.52s)]
*  for a while, but all of these models will converge in the [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1348.36s)]
*  absence of highly unique data, right, what I've been calling [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1351.36s)]
*  these white truffles. So if you can hoard white truffles, your [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1354.96s)]
*  model will be better. Otherwise, your model will be the same as [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1359.04s)]
*  everybody else's model. And then you have the distribution [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1361.6s)]
*  endpoints of which there are many whose economic incentives [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1365.6s)]
*  are very high, right? So Facebook doesn't want to just [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1368.68s)]
*  sit around and have all this traffic go to chat GPT, they [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1371.6000000000001s)]
*  want to be able to enable Instagram users and WhatsApp [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1374.2s)]
*  users and Facebook users to interact through Messenger, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1377.48s)]
*  what have you. Obviously, Google has a you know, many [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1380.0s)]
*  hundreds of billions of reasons to defend their territory. So I [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1383.52s)]
*  think all of this to me just means that these are really [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1388.0800000000002s)]
*  important use cases. As an investor, I think it's important [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1390.4s)]
*  to just stay a little patient. Because it's not clear to me [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1396.2s)]
*  that there are any natural blockers. But I do think that [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1400.28s)]
*  David's right that it's demonstrating a use case that's [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1403.44s)]
*  important. But it's still so early, we are six weeks in. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1405.88s)]
*  Yeah, I tell you, I think there's a couple of great [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1411.48s)]
*  blockers here, or there's going to be an M&A bonanza for [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1413.72s)]
*  Silicon Valley. If you look at certain data sets, Reddit, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1416.4s)]
*  Stack Overflow for programming, and Quora, these things are [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1420.92s)]
*  going to be worth a fortune and to be able to buy those or get [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1425.68s)]
*  exclusive licenses to those if you're maybe Google Bard, or if [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1428.8400000000001s)]
*  you're chat GPT, that could be a major difference maker [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1432.5600000000002s)]
*  Twitter's data set, obviously. And then you look at certain [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1435.04s)]
*  tools like Zapier, and if this and that they've spent a decade [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1438.28s)]
*  building the sort of, you know, meta API, that would be an [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1441.6000000000001s)]
*  incredible blocker. I think this is going to be like a [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1446.04s)]
*  balkanization. I'll be honest, I'm sources for free. They didn't [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1448.4s)]
*  plug in for free. Exactly. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1452.28s)]
*  That I was just gonna say, I don't think these are not [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1453.92s)]
*  blockers. I don't think this is the ace of hearts on a flush [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1455.88s)]
*  board. I don't think so. I think that these things are really [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1458.24s)]
*  interesting assets. They are definitely truffly in nature. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1461.3600000000001s)]
*  But they may not be the, you know, 10 pound white truffle [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1465.92s)]
*  from Alba that we're looking for. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1468.8000000000002s)]
*  You know, but on the M&A side, don't you think this would be [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1470.24s)]
*  like incredible? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1472.72s)]
*  No, but the only reason I say that again, is it is just so [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1473.5600000000002s)]
*  early. Like I in the text, I mentioned this to you guys, I [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1476.0800000000002s)]
*  remember, and Sax and I were in the middle of this. We were both [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1479.0800000000002s)]
*  right at the beginning of social networking. Sax started [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1483.4s)]
*  Genie, I was in the middle of AIM. And all of a sudden, we saw [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1486.48s)]
*  Reed start social net. Then we saw Friendster get started. Then [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1489.96s)]
*  we saw MySpace get started. And you have to remember, when you [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1494.68s)]
*  look back now 20 years later, the winner was the seventh [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1498.2s)]
*  company, which was Facebook, not the first, not the second, it [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1501.6000000000001s)]
*  was the seventh, which started two and a half years properly [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1504.4s)]
*  after the entire Web 0.20 phenomenon started. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1508.16s)]
*  Yeah, same with search, by the way, where Google was probably [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1511.8s)]
*  20th to the scene. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1514.8s)]
*  Yeah, Excite Lycos. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1516.6799999999998s)]
*  If you want to be a real student of business history, I'll just [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1518.0s)]
*  say something that's more meta, which is, if there's something [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1520.6399999999999s)]
*  that I've learned on the heels of this SVB fiasco, is that [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1524.3999999999999s)]
*  there is an enormous amount of negative perception of Silicon [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1528.76s)]
*  Valley, and frankly, a lot of disdain for VCs and [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1533.28s)]
*  prognosticating technologists, right? And I think that- [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1537.68s)]
*  So you mean this podcast? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1540.92s)]
*  I think we have to be very careful. Yeah. And I do think [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1543.0s)]
*  that we are an example of that, because we are the bright, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1546.5600000000002s)]
*  shiny object of the people that were successful. And the broad [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1548.6000000000001s)]
*  makeup of America thinks that we're not nearly as smart as we [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1552.48s)]
*  all think we are. And after all of this money that's been [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1555.64s)]
*  burned in crypto land, and NFTs and all of this Web 3 nonsense, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1558.88s)]
*  to yet again whip up the next hype cycle, I think doesn't [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1563.3200000000002s)]
*  serve us well. So I do think there's something very [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1567.16s)]
*  important here. But I think if we want to maintain [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1571.1200000000001s)]
*  reputational capital through this cycle, because government [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1576.6000000000001s)]
*  will get involved much faster in this cycle, I think it's [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1580.6000000000001s)]
*  important to just be methodical and thoughtful, iterate, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1583.0400000000002s)]
*  experiment, but it's too early to call it, I guess, is what I [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1586.64s)]
*  would say. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1589.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely too early to call it. But, Sachs, you're [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1589.72s)]
*  saying explicitly, you think this is bigger than the [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1592.48s)]
*  internet itself, bigger than mobile as a platform shift. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1595.08s)]
*  It's definitely top three. And I think it might be the biggest [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1598.96s)]
*  ever. I think look, I think things could certainly play out [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1601.04s)]
*  the way that Jamath is saying, however, I actually think that [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1603.6799999999998s)]
*  open AI has demonstrated now with these platform features, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1606.84s)]
*  that it has a lead, a substantial lead. And I actually [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1610.8s)]
*  think that lead is likely to grow in the next year. And let [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1615.84s)]
*  me tell you why. I think it's got a couple of assets here that [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1618.36s)]
*  are hard to replicate. So number one, user attention, I [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1621.12s)]
*  think they've now got, I would guess hundreds of millions of [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1625.12s)]
*  users and this thing is caught on like wildfire, must have been [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1627.52s)]
*  beyond their wildest dream. I think it even surprised them how [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1631.76s)]
*  much this has taken off. It's really captured the public's [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1634.56s)]
*  imagination and people are discovering new use cases for it [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1637.56s)]
*  every day. If you are sort of the number two or number three, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1640.9599999999998s)]
*  the seventh large language model to basically get deployed behind [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1644.8s)]
*  a chat bot, I just don't think you're going to get that kind [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1648.96s)]
*  of distribution because the novelty factor will have worn [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1651.24s)]
*  off and people will have already kind of learned to use chat GPT. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1653.56s)]
*  So number one is the hundreds of millions of eyeballs. Number two [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1657.8s)]
*  is with this developer platform, I think we should describe a [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1661.3600000000001s)]
*  couple of other features of it. One of the problems with chat [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1664.1200000000001s)]
*  GPT, if you've used it is that the training data ends in 2021. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1668.24s)]
*  And so you very rapidly for many questions get to a stopping [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1672.24s)]
*  point where it says like, I don't, I don't know the answer [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1675.68s)]
*  to that because I don't have any information about the last [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1678.4s)]
*  two years. Well, one of the plugins that open AI is [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1680.76s)]
*  introduced itself is called the browsing plugin. And it allows [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1684.52s)]
*  chat GPT to go search the internet, and not just run [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1688.2s)]
*  internet searches, but to run an internet search as if it were a [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1691.88s)]
*  human. So you ask, you ask chat GPT a question, and it goes to [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1694.88s)]
*  find it runs a search, and then it scours through the list of [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1699.88s)]
*  20 links. And it doesn't stop until it finds a good answer. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1703.3600000000001s)]
*  And then it comes back to you with just the answer. So it [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1706.88s)]
*  actually saves you the time of clicking through all those loops [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1708.68s)]
*  and it'll give you the browsing history to show you what it did. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1711.2800000000002s)]
*  That's mind blowing. They also have a thing called a retrieval [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1714.1200000000001s)]
*  API, which allows developers to share proprietary knowledge bases [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1716.8400000000001s)]
*  with chat GPT. So if you have a company knowledge base or some [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1721.5200000000002s)]
*  other kind of content, you can share with chat GPT so that chat [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1724.92s)]
*  GPT can be aware of that. And there are some privacy concerns, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1729.4s)]
*  but the company has said they're going to sandbox that data and [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1732.5200000000002s)]
*  protect it. As an example, I'm planning on writing a book on [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1734.92s)]
*  SAS using chat GPT. And I'm going to put together all the [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1739.52s)]
*  previous articles and talks I've done as a database, so I can then [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1742.92s)]
*  work with that in chat GPT. So you're going to have more and [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1745.96s)]
*  more developers sharing information with chat GPT, you're [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1749.24s)]
*  going to have chat GPT able to update its training based on sort [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1755.3600000000001s)]
*  of the last two years, be able to search the internet. And I [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1759.24s)]
*  think that as those hundreds of millions of users use the [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1762.0s)]
*  product, and as developers keep sharing more and more of these [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1764.92s)]
*  data sets, the AI is going to get smarter and smarter. And then [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1767.24s)]
*  what's going to happen is both consumers and developers are [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1770.4s)]
*  going to want to use or build on the smartest API. Yeah, see, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1773.24s)]
*  this is where it feeds on itself. I mean, yeah, I think [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1777.16s)]
*  there might be a I agree with much of what you're saying. But I [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1780.04s)]
*  do think somebody like Facebook when they release their language [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1783.48s)]
*  model, which they're about to, is not going to allow chat GPT [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1786.62s)]
*  to have any access to the Facebook corpus of data. And [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1790.04s)]
*  then LinkedIn will do the same, they'll block any access to chat [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1793.12s)]
*  GPT to their data. And so then you might say, you know what, I'm [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1796.08s)]
*  doing something related to business and business contacts, I [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1799.2s)]
*  need to use the LinkedIn one. And they're just going to block [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1801.8799999999999s)]
*  other people's usage, I'm gonna tell you, hey, you have to come [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1804.12s)]
*  to our interface and have a pro account on LinkedIn. And this [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1806.2s)]
*  all becomes little islands of data. And so I'm not sure that [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1808.92s)]
*  you may be right to a cow's too early to have a definitive [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1812.76s)]
*  opinion. But I would say [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1814.8799999999999s)]
*  to believe plugins are going to be promiscuous. Yes, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1815.8s)]
*  plugins are the refutation of your idea. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1818.4s)]
*  Facebook does not have an API. Twitter turned off their API [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1820.3200000000002s)]
*  people who are [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1823.28s)]
*  core doesn't let people use its data. So I just picked three. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1825.0400000000002s)]
*  Those are three incredible data sets that don't allow people and [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1828.92s)]
*  Craigslist doesn't. So people who are smart, do not allow API [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1831.5600000000002s)]
*  is into their data. They keep it for themselves. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1834.6000000000001s)]
*  I think there were a lot of people when the App Store rolled [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1837.6000000000001s)]
*  out that swore up and down, they never build a mobile app because [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1841.3200000000002s)]
*  they didn't want to give Apple that kind of power that the [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1844.0400000000002s)]
*  internet was open, whereas the App Store is closed and curated [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1845.88s)]
*  by Apple. And sure enough, they all at the end of the day had to [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1849.2800000000002s)]
*  roll out apps, even though in the case of Facebook, it [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1852.48s)]
*  definitely has made them vulnerable, because they're [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1855.1200000000001s)]
*  downstream of Apple. I mean, Apple now has enormous [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1857.2800000000002s)]
*  influence over Facebook's advertising revenue, because [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1860.64s)]
*  users have to go through Apple, they never had to do that before [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1864.0400000000002s)]
*  the internet. Nonetheless, Facebook felt compelled to [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1866.4s)]
*  release a mobile app because they knew was existential for [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1869.48s)]
*  them if they did it. And I believe that what's happening [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1871.68s)]
*  I don't think it's right analogy, the right analogy would [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1874.8s)]
*  be Google search. Does Facebook does Craigslist allow their data [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1876.6s)]
*  to be indexed inside of Google search answers? No, right? They [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1880.52s)]
*  block that for a reason. They and they will write a cease and [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1883.52s)]
*  desist letter. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1886.28s)]
*  Fine. So So you know what, those guys will stay out of it. But [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1887.08s)]
*  look how much content Google search already has. And I think [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1889.4s)]
*  that chat GPT will start by eating a substantial portion of [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1892.36s)]
*  search because again, you don't have to go through the 20 links, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1896.24s)]
*  it just gives you the answer. It's going to eat a substantial [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1898.56s)]
*  portion of browser usage and app usage, because you're just [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1901.44s)]
*  going to tell chat GPT what you want to do. It will go book your [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1905.16s)]
*  plane ticket, it will go book your hotel room. Yeah, see, this [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1907.8400000000001s)]
*  is a play in this. Hold on the apps that want to play in this [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1911.64s)]
*  will benefit. So there'll be a powerful incentive for [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1914.92s)]
*  applications to get an advantage by participating. Let me finish [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1918.0s)]
*  my point. Yeah. And then eventually, they will be forced [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1921.3200000000002s)]
*  to do it not because they get an advantage, but because they're [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1924.96s)]
*  so competitively disadvantaged, if they don't participate in [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1927.04s)]
*  that ecosystem, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1930.08s)]
*  I agree that they'll participate in it. But here's the thing, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1930.96s)]
*  what's going to happen is Google is going to turn on Bard and I've [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1933.6s)]
*  been playing with Bard, it is 80% of chat GPT already. And then [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1935.8799999999999s)]
*  when they make Bard a default, you know, little snippet on your [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1940.0s)]
*  Google search return page or Bard is built into YouTube, or [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1945.04s)]
*  Chrome or Android, or the Play Store, they're going to roll [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1948.08s)]
*  right over chat GPT because they have billions of users already. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1951.12s)]
*  So this advantage that you see today, I see that getting rolled [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1954.56s)]
*  real quick, because you'll be on YouTube. And on the top right [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1958.52s)]
*  hand side will be barred. And when you do a search, it's going [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1961.3999999999999s)]
*  to say, here are other sentences you could do, oh, you want to [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1963.4399999999998s)]
*  search Mr. Beast, when he's helped people or Mr. Beast, when [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1966.0s)]
*  he's given away more money, or people who've copied and been [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1969.3999999999999s)]
*  inspired by Mr. Beast, all that's going to occur inside of [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1971.36s)]
*  YouTube, and chat GPT is not going to have access to the [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1973.6399999999999s)]
*  YouTube corpus of data. And then when you do a search, it's going [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1975.8799999999999s)]
*  to be the same thing, it's going to be on the right hand side. And [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1978.32s)]
*  it's going to be playing just like it is in Bing, if you turn [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1980.4799999999998s)]
*  on your Android phone, they're going to make Google Assistant [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1982.76s)]
*  go right into barred. And Google Assistant is already used [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1985.4s)]
*  by hundreds of millions of people. So I think that Google [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1988.24s)]
*  will roll. I think they're going to roll chat GPT. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1991.44s)]
*  I don't know who's going to win. But I'm looking at this saxipoo [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1994.52s)]
*  more reductively as a capitalist, which is what are [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=1998.4s)]
*  people's incentives, because that's what they'll do. Google's [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2002.24s)]
*  incentive is to usurp chat GPT usage by inserting something [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2005.24s)]
*  inside of their existing distribution channels to [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2013.68s)]
*  suppress the ability for you to want to go to the app, known as [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2016.88s)]
*  bundling. I think Facebook has that same incentive. Oddly, even [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2021.3200000000002s)]
*  though Microsoft is such a deep partner, I think certain assets [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2025.8400000000001s)]
*  of Microsoft have that incentive, you're talking [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2028.3600000000001s)]
*  collectively about five or $6 trillion of market cap, then [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2030.44s)]
*  when you add in Alexa, and Amazon, and Siri and Apple, what [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2033.8000000000002s)]
*  is their incentive? I don't think their incentive is to let [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2039.8400000000001s)]
*  this happen. And I think if you look at the slack, Microsoft [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2042.84s)]
*  Teams example of even a better engineer product, who's [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2046.08s)]
*  excellent and widely deployed, even at hundreds of millions of [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2048.92s)]
*  users doesn't much matter when it's more cleverly distributed [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2052.68s)]
*  and priced. And so those things, again, you may still be right, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2058.4s)]
*  all I'm saying is, it's just so early to know. And as slow and [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2062.72s)]
*  lumbering as some of these big companies are, they are not so [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2067.96s)]
*  stupid as to kill their own golden goose and or defend it [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2071.8s)]
*  when threatened. So I think you just have to let let it see what [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2075.2000000000003s)]
*  happens. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2077.96s)]
*  I want to finish the point on Google, and then we can move on [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2078.4s)]
*  to the bundling thing. Let me just make the counter argument, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2080.1600000000003s)]
*  which is that I think Google was caught completely flat footed [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2082.4s)]
*  here, even though they shouldn't have been because they published [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2086.0s)]
*  the original paper on Transformers in 2017. They [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2087.92s)]
*  should have seen where all of this was going, but they didn't [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2091.7200000000003s)]
*  open AI use that paper and commercialized it. And the proof [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2094.44s)]
*  of that is there was just a lawsuit a couple of days ago, or [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2098.96s)]
*  at least a claim by a former employee of Google who quit, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2102.2400000000002s)]
*  because he said that they were using chat GPT to train their AI. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2106.08s)]
*  So their AI is so far behind. They were violating the terms of [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2112.36s)]
*  use. Hold on, they were violating the terms of use of [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2116.7200000000003s)]
*  open AI to train their own AI on chat GPT. That's not a good [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2119.44s)]
*  sign. That's not a good sign. I also think hold on. Hold on. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2124.28s)]
*  I'm just making the counter argument here. I mean, don't [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2129.04s)]
*  dismiss it out of hand. Give me a chance to explain it. Moreover, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2131.2400000000002s)]
*  chat GPT-4, which was just released a few weeks ago, we [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2135.08s)]
*  know that open AI had that they were using internally for seven [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2139.28s)]
*  months. So the state of the art is not what we're using. It's [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2143.16s)]
*  what open AI has internally. They're obviously working now on [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2146.84s)]
*  chat GPT-5. And so if you're saying that Bard is 80% of chat [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2150.92s)]
*  GPT-4, well, I got news for you, it's probably 50% or 20% of chat [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2156.6s)]
*  GPT-5. And who knows what the product roadmap is inside of [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2161.96s)]
*  open AI. I am sure that they've got 200 ideas for things they [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2166.12s)]
*  could do to make it better and loing fruit. But look, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2171.16s)]
*  regardless, I think the pace of innovation here and development [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2173.7599999999998s)]
*  is going to speed up massively. I mean, there is going to be a [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2177.12s)]
*  flurry of activity. I agree, it's hard to know exactly how [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2180.2s)]
*  it's going to play out. But I think this idea that it's a [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2183.48s)]
*  foregone conclusion, these big companies are just going to [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2186.2s)]
*  catch up with open AI. I think that there's a strong [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2188.48s)]
*  counter argument. That's not the case. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2191.0s)]
*  I'm making a very specific argument. It's not a foregone [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2192.7599999999998s)]
*  conclusion where all the value will get captured. Just like in [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2195.08s)]
*  any of these major tidal waves. If you make the bets too early, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2198.08s)]
*  you typically don't make all the money. And it tends to be the [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2203.3999999999996s)]
*  case and it has been in the past, at least with these [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2207.3199999999997s)]
*  transformative moves. It's sort of in the early third of the [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2209.68s)]
*  cycle, is where the real opportunities to make the tons [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2213.64s)]
*  of money emerge. And there's a lot of folks that show you a [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2216.64s)]
*  path and then just don't necessarily capture the value. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2219.72s)]
*  I'm not saying that that's going to be the case here. All I'm [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2222.48s)]
*  saying is if history is a guide, all of these other big waves [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2225.44s)]
*  have shown that fact pattern. And so I'm very excited and I'm [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2229.16s)]
*  paying attention. But I'm just being circumspect with this idea [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2232.8399999999997s)]
*  that you know, having been in the middle of these couple of [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2237.2s)]
*  waves before it, I made all the money by waiting a couple of [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2239.16s)]
*  years. I don't know if that's going to be true this time [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2242.0s)]
*  around. But right, that's sort of my posture right now. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2243.68s)]
*  So you obviously have a point because we're only four months [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2245.96s)]
*  in. So how can we know where this is going to be in five [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2248.2s)]
*  years? So you could be right to your point, Sacks. I think it's [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2249.96s)]
*  clear. And this is, you know, big ups to the OpenAI team that [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2253.2s)]
*  they will be one of the top two or three players. Absolutely. We [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2257.32s)]
*  all agree on that, which is extraordinary in itself. And the [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2260.68s)]
*  top four players, Freeberg are obviously going to be Microsoft [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2263.56s)]
*  OpenAI, we'll call that like, whatever that little, you know, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2267.36s)]
*  pairing, and then Google, Facebook, and then we haven't [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2271.64s)]
*  talked about Apple, but obviously, Apple is not going [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2275.52s)]
*  to take this sitting down. And hopefully, they'll get in gear [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2277.56s)]
*  and have Siri, you know, make it to the next level, or they'll [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2280.8799999999997s)]
*  just put her out to pasture. If you were to look at those four, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2283.48s)]
*  and we're sitting here a year from now, who has the best [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2288.56s)]
*  product offering? Who has the biggest user base? Just take a [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2291.24s)]
*  minute to think about that. Because you were at Google. And [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2294.68s)]
*  we all know, the word on the street is, it's the return of [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2297.72s)]
*  the Kings. Larry and Sergey are super engaged by all reports, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2302.12s)]
*  every back channel, everybody I talked to was saying that [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2306.0s)]
*  they're every day, they're obsessed with Google's legacy [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2308.0s)]
*  now and making this happen. So what can you tell us in terms of [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2311.52s)]
*  who you think a year or two from now will have the biggest user [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2315.3999999999996s)]
*  base and be the most innovative amongst that quartet? Or maybe [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2319.04s)]
*  you think there's other players who will emerge? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2323.48s)]
*  The advantage that open AI has, which is the advantage that any [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2325.4799999999996s)]
*  call it emerging, you know, advantage competitor has [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2331.68s)]
*  outside is, yeah, outsider is that the incumbents are [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2336.8799999999997s)]
*  handicapped by their current scale. Much of the [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2341.16s)]
*  consideration set that Google has had in deciding what features [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2344.4399999999996s)]
*  and tools to launch with respect to AI over the last couple of [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2348.4399999999996s)]
*  years, has been driven fundamentally by a concern about [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2351.08s)]
*  public policy and public reaction. And I know this from [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2353.88s)]
*  speaking to folks there that are close enough to kind of indicate [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2357.4s)]
*  like, Google has been so targeted has been such the point [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2362.2400000000002s)]
*  of attack by governments around the world with respect to their [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2367.2000000000003s)]
*  scale and monopoly and monopolistic kind of behavior, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2371.08s)]
*  as some people have framed it, privacy concerns, you know, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2376.4s)]
*  etc, etc, the fines and the EU are extraordinary, that so [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2380.08s)]
*  much of what goes on at Google today is, can I get approval to [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2383.8s)]
*  do this? And so many people have felt so frustrated that they [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2387.4s)]
*  can't actually unleash the toolkit that Google has built. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2389.88s)]
*  And so they've been harnessed and focused on these internal [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2392.96s)]
*  capabilities. I think I mentioned this in the past, but [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2395.7200000000003s)]
*  things like, what's the right video to show on YouTube to keep [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2398.04s)]
*  people engaged? What's the right ad to show to increase click [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2401.36s)]
*  through rates, etc, etc, versus building great consumer products [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2404.84s)]
*  for fear of the backlash that would arise, and governments [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2408.4s)]
*  coming down on them and ultimately, and ultimately [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2411.28s)]
*  attacking the revenue and the core revenue stream. And this is [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2413.7200000000003s)]
*  no different than any other kind of innovative dilemma, you know, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2417.84s)]
*  any other business of scale in any other industry historically [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2420.76s)]
*  ultimately gets disrupted, because their job at that point [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2423.52s)]
*  is to protect their cash flow and their revenue stream and [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2426.5600000000004s)]
*  their balance and assets, not to disrupt themselves, especially [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2429.32s)]
*  as a public company, especially under the scrutiny and the watch [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2433.6800000000003s)]
*  fly of governments and regulators. So I think Google [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2436.6000000000004s)]
*  has, in aggregate, probably good competitive talent, if not [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2439.32s)]
*  better talent than open AI and others. Google has arguably the [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2444.36s)]
*  best corpus of data upon which to train the best capabilities, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2448.52s)]
*  the best toolkit, the best hardware issues are lowest cost [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2452.36s)]
*  for running these sorts of models, the lowest cost for [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2455.56s)]
*  serving them, etc, etc. So frankly, they're way behind the [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2458.04s)]
*  battle is there is to lose, if they are willing to disrupt [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2462.44s)]
*  themselves. And this is the moment that Larry and Sergey [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2465.44s)]
*  should wield those founders shares that they have. And they [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2468.32s)]
*  should wield the comments that they wrote in that founders [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2470.76s)]
*  letter, that they will always make the right decision for the [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2472.88s)]
*  long term for this company, even if it means taking a cost in the [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2475.36s)]
*  short term and disrupting themselves. This is the moment [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2478.44s)]
*  to prove that those founders shares were worth, you know, the [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2481.52s)]
*  negotiation to get there. And, and I think that it is going to [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2485.48s)]
*  require a real degree of scrutiny, a real degree of [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2488.7200000000003s)]
*  regulatory uncertainty, a real degree of challenge by [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2491.92s)]
*  governments and public policy people, and perhaps even a [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2494.76s)]
*  revenue hit in the near term to realize the opportunity. But I [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2498.04s)]
*  do think that they're better equipped to win if they chose to [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2500.96s)]
*  well said. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2504.08s)]
*  Well, really well said. I think the founder share insight is [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2505.12s)]
*  particularly interesting, Sachs. The fact that [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2507.64s)]
*  by the way, sorry, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2511.0s)]
*  those did nothing with them. Good, Jemma. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2511.68s)]
*  Yeah, no, I was just gonna say the exact same thing. It's like [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2513.2799999999997s)]
*  if they don't use it now, what would it take and when? Yeah, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2515.64s)]
*  this is good. And yet another yet another case of the emperor [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2520.4s)]
*  has no clothes, just a power grab by Silicon Valley execs, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2523.72s)]
*  which was meaningless. Because if in this moment, you don't [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2527.16s)]
*  wield that power, and break that company into bits as you need [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2529.52s)]
*  to, what was the point of having it? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2533.24s)]
*  They need to come in and say, we're going to give barred [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2534.72s)]

*  the comments under the video, you have the transcript of what [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2567.28s)]
*  happened in this video. And then what was the question and answer [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2570.08s)]
*  underneath it? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2572.96s)]
*  Let me make the counterpoint, please, to my own point, like [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2573.8s)]
*  look at how Gersener came after Zuck. So Zuck had his point of [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2576.88s)]
*  view, his strongly held belief that AR VR was the future of the [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2580.2000000000003s)]
*  platform. That's what he wanted to bet into. That's what he [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2584.08s)]
*  wanted to lean into. It's what he wanted to build the company [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2586.52s)]
*  against. He did it. And then the financial analysts and the [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2588.2s)]
*  investors came at him and said, this is a waste of money. Focus [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2592.28s)]
*  on making money. You have a responsibility to shareholders, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2595.52s)]
*  F those founders shares, you don't deserve that 10x voting [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2598.08s)]
*  right, or whatever the framing might have been to get him to [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2600.44s)]
*  say, you know what, I acquiesce, I'm giving it up. And I think [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2603.0s)]
*  that we should also think about what's going to happen on the [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2605.96s)]
*  other side. Google is a trillion plus dollar market cap company. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2607.52s)]
*  Their shares are owned by every public endowment, public [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2610.92s)]
*  pension fund, institutional investor owns Google in their [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2613.88s)]
*  portfolio. So the backlash against Google making a hard bet [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2616.56s)]
*  like this, and potentially destroying billions of dollars of [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2619.92s)]
*  cash flow in the process every year will not be easy to do that [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2623.52s)]
*  the same sorts of letters that Gersener at all, and obviously, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2626.7200000000003s)]
*  we love Gersener, you know, we can all defend him all day long. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2629.6800000000003s)]
*  At Zuck is what might may end up happening with with alphabet if [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2632.96s)]
*  they did choose to go this path. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2637.12s)]
*  Saks, what do you think here about the founder share [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2638.12s)]
*  specifically in Google's chances of disrupting themselves and, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2640.72s)]
*  you know, just putting this into every product and shoving it [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2644.9599999999996s)]
*  down users throats and catching up? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2648.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, I mean, with all due respect, Larry and Sergey, I [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2651.68s)]
*  mean, they've been on the beach a long time. That's reminds me [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2655.12s)]
*  this reminds me of Apollo Creed coming out of retirement in [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2658.4399999999996s)]
*  rocket four. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2661.8399999999997s)]
*  A lot of shape. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2663.4399999999996s)]
*  shape. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2664.92s)]
*  A lot of a lot of fanfare. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2666.1600000000003s)]
*  They could be a little out of shape. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2670.04s)]
*  Sam Altman may not look like Ivan Drago. But but this this is [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2671.28s)]
*  one shrewd character. This is one shrewd character. I mean, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2674.36s)]
*  Altman is fit. He's fit. He's been in the arena. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2677.56s)]
*  Yeah, he's you know, he's a multi time founder who sat at the [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2680.56s)]
*  top of YC and got to see everything that worked. Yep. And [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2683.2000000000003s)]
*  got to see all the research and he's been plugging away at this [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2686.6400000000003s)]
*  for what like eight years. So there's a there's a big I just [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2690.12s)]
*  think there's a big gap to catch up on. Now, Google has all the [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2695.64s)]
*  resources in the world. And they've got a lot of proprietary [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2698.3199999999997s)]
*  assets too. And they've got all the incentive in the world. So [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2701.6s)]
*  do I think that Google will be one of the top four players in [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2703.92s)]
*  AI? Absolutely. But this idea that is going to come in steam [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2707.08s)]
*  roll open AI. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2710.64s)]
*  I got a prediction. Within next year, Larry and Sergey take the [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2712.52s)]
*  title of co CEOs. And then they do a demo day where the two of [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2715.7999999999997s)]
*  them get on stage. And they actually do the demo to these [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2719.64s)]
*  products. Just that happens. That fictional pontification. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2723.12s)]
*  That's it. That's listen and based on the president. Those [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2726.56s)]
*  are my two predictions. I'm taking a lot of readings. Can [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2729.48s)]
*  you imagine if Larry Freiburg where the chances of Larry and [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2731.92s)]
*  Sergey taking co CEO slots? That's prediction one and then [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2736.0s)]
*  prediction two, where the chances of them running the [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2738.48s)]
*  next Google IO, where they get on stage and they walk people [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2740.56s)]
*  through all the products that they shepherded. And that they [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2744.64s)]
*  have a vested interest in that they're they want to demo. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2747.76s)]
*  There is an institutional problem at Google. At the top [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2750.76s)]
*  level, which does need to be solved. Which is this position [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2754.0800000000004s)]
*  of constantly being in defense against the scrutiny again, of [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2758.5600000000004s)]
*  regulators and public policy folks and you know, all these [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2762.6400000000003s)]
*  different groups that are against Google. And so as a [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2766.76s)]
*  result, that the kind of cultural seasoning, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2769.92s)]
*  particularly the executive and the board level has been one of [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2772.8s)]
*  like, you know, protect the nest. Don't overreach, don't [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2775.88s)]
*  overstep. And it's a real, you know, I think one for the for [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2779.88s)]
*  the business school books or whatever, ultimately is what [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2784.6400000000003s)]
*  they end up doing about it. Because now is, you know, the [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2787.32s)]
*  time when that defensive posture is really kind of putting the [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2789.56s)]
*  entire business at risk. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2793.08s)]
*  The same thing happened to Microsoft, remember in the late [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2794.2400000000002s)]
*  90s, that's right, when they got crushed by that antitrust [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2796.1600000000003s)]
*  lawsuit, that can be very defensive. Well, that can know [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2798.88s)]
*  but that consent decree they put they had a wartime CEO come in [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2802.0s)]
*  Balmer came in and, you know, followed by kind of an [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2805.24s)]
*  innovative guy who could kind of continue to build. And I think [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2808.6s)]
*  that there may be a moment here I look I love Sundar. He's a [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2812.16s)]
*  great guy, great CEO, Sundar and I don't know if I guys if I [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2816.52s)]
*  ever told you this, he and I started at Google on the same [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2819.12s)]
*  day. We're both in the same nuclear class, we were the [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2820.64s)]
*  frigging hat on the TGIF day and on stage, he was a product [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2823.08s)]
*  manager and now he runs the company. But I think the question [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2826.9199999999996s)]
*  is like, whether it's the CEO or the broader whole kind of [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2830.6s)]
*  executive org or the board, a degree of disruption necessary [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2834.48s)]
*  to shift that cultural seasoning is so necessary right now, for [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2838.08s)]
*  them to have a shot at this. And similar to what you just said, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2841.2400000000002s)]
*  Zach's like, you're gonna need a bomber type moment to kind of, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2843.36s)]
*  you know, reinvigorate that business. And by the way, I'll [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2847.36s)]
*  tell you such a moment, I think, then. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2850.28s)]
*  Well, yeah, it's an important point, when bomber took over [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2852.72s)]
*  during that period after Gates, when they were on their heels, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2856.16s)]
*  he basically just focused on revenue and paying dividends and [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2858.72s)]
*  stock buybacks and the stock went sideways. And he missed [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2863.0s)]
*  mobile. And now, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2866.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good point, Jacob. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2868.36s)]
*  Yeah, you're forgetting one big thing, which is that that was [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2869.6s)]
*  also because he had to operate under a consent decree to the [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2872.4s)]
*  DOJ. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2874.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2875.4s)]
*  So the product managers of Microsoft were replaced with [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2875.88s)]
*  lawyers from the Department of Justice, and you had to get [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2878.28s)]
*  their sign off before you could ship anything. So we have to [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2880.68s)]
*  remember that those things probably slowed Microsoft down as [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2884.24s)]
*  well. And the great thing that Satya had was a blank slate, and [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2887.08s)]
*  the removal of that consent decree. So he was able to do [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2892.48s)]
*  everything that just made a lot of sense. And he's executed [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2895.28s)]
*  flawlessly. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2899.12s)]
*  I think the problem at Google is not Sundar or Larry or Sergey. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2901.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it's more in the deep bowels of middle management of [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2907.04s)]
*  that company, which is that there's just far too many [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2910.2400000000002s)]
*  people that probably have an opinion. And their opinion is [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2912.44s)]
*  not shrouded in survival. Their opinion is shrouded in elite [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2916.96s)]
*  language around what is the moral and ethical implications [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2921.4s)]
*  of this and where has this been properly tested on the diaspora [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2925.36s)]
*  of 19 different ethnic tribes of the Amazon. That's the kind of [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2930.28s)]
*  decision making that is a nice to have when you are the second [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2933.84s)]
*  or third most valuable technology company in the world. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2938.8s)]
*  But you have to be able to pause that kind of thinking and [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2942.36s)]
*  instead get into wartime survival mode. And it's very [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2945.96s)]
*  hard. So it doesn't almost matter. At this point, what [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2949.48s)]
*  Sundar wants, the real question is, what is the capability of [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2953.64s)]
*  middle management to either do it or get out of the way. And I [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2957.64s)]
*  think that in all of these big companies that struggle, what [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2961.08s)]
*  you really see is an inability for middle management to get [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2964.84s)]
*  out of the way, or, frankly, just you need somebody to then [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2967.44s)]
*  fire them. And if you look at folks who get their groove back, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2971.2400000000002s)]
*  let's see what Facebook does. What are they targeting? They're [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2976.0s)]
*  targeting middle management. If you look at what Elon does in [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2979.12s)]
*  the companies that he owns, there is virtually no middle [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2983.4s)]
*  management. It's like get out of the way, build product, build [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2986.6s)]
*  product and ship it. Yeah. And what is the core truth? And so [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2991.44s)]
*  if failure is there in front of you, and if David is right, that [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2995.2799999999997s)]
*  you have 200 million users come out of nowhere, who are voting [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=2998.24s)]

*  that doesn't create a five alarm fire where you get middle [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3006.12s)]

*  generally, how close are we getting to a GI, which is what [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3079.32s)]
*  everybody's scared of, is that these agents start working with [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3081.76s)]
*  each other in the background to do things that are against human [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3085.32s)]
*  interest. I know it sounds like science fiction. But there is a [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3088.4s)]
*  theory that when these AIs start operating on their own, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3092.08s)]
*  like we explained in the previous sort of segment here [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3095.74s)]

*  on feedback from each other, could they get out of control and [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3103.4s)]
*  be mischievous and then work against human interest? So what [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3106.74s)]
*  do you think sex? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3109.3199999999997s)]
*  I think there's a difference between what could happen in the [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3110.12s)]
*  short term and then what could happen in the long term. I think [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3112.7599999999998s)]
*  in the short term, everything we're seeing right now is very [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3115.16s)]
*  positive. And let me just give you an example. There was a [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3118.6s)]
*  really interesting tweet storm about a guy who wrote about how [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3121.56s)]
*  chat GPT saved his dog. Did you guys see this? This is one of [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3126.62s)]
*  the really mind blowing ones to me use cases. So his dog was [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3131.04s)]
*  sick, took him to a vet, vet prescribed some medication three [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3135.4s)]
*  days later, dog still sick, in fact, even worse. So the owner [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3138.68s)]
*  of the pet just literally copied and pasted the lab result for the [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3143.12s)]
*  blood test for the dog with all the lab values into chat GPT and [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3147.18s)]
*  said, What could this be? Like, what's your likely diagnosis? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3151.08s)]
*  chat GPT gave three possible answers, three illnesses. The [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3154.84s)]
*  first one was what the vet basically diagnosed with. So [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3159.3199999999997s)]
*  that wasn't it. The second one was excluded by another test. So [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3162.68s)]
*  he then went to a second vet and said, Listen, I think my dog has [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3165.88s)]
*  the third one. And vet prescribed something and sure [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3169.68s)]
*  enough dog is cured saved. So that's really mind blowing that [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3173.0s)]
*  even though chat GPT hasn't been specifically optimized, as far as [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3178.4s)]
*  we know, for lab results, it could figure this out. The [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3182.12s)]
*  reason I'm mentioning this is it gives you a sense of the [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3185.7400000000002s)]
*  potential here to cure disease to, you know, like I could see [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3187.6800000000003s)]
*  major medical breakthroughs based on the AI in the next five [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3192.6s)]
*  or 10 years. Now, the question is, like, what happens in the [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3196.36s)]
*  long term, you know, as the AI gets smarter and smarter, and we [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3200.4s)]
*  are kind of getting into the realm of science fiction, but [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3203.48s)]
*  here would be the scenario is you're on chat GPT 10 or 20 or [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3206.32s)]
*  whatever it is, or maybe some other companies AI. And the [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3211.2400000000002s)]
*  developers asked the AI, Hey, how could you make yourself [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3215.0800000000004s)]
*  better? Now do it, which is a question we asked chat GPT all [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3217.84s)]
*  the time in different contexts. And so chat GPT will already [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3221.92s)]
*  have the ability to write perfect code by that point. I [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3226.48s)]
*  think, you know, code writing is one of the I think of its [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3228.48s)]
*  superpowers already. So it gives itself the ability to rewrite [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3231.2000000000003s)]
*  its code to auto update it to recursively make itself better. I [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3235.24s)]
*  mean, at that point, isn't that like a speciation event doesn't [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3239.3599999999997s)]
*  that very quickly lead to the singularity if the AI has the [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3243.64s)]
*  capability to rewrite its own code to make itself better? And [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3247.68s)]
*  you know, won't it very quickly write billions of versions of [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3251.64s)]
*  itself? And you know, it's very hard to predict what that future [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3254.08s)]
*  looks like. Now, I also don't know how far away we are from [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3257.72s)]
*  that that could be 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, whatever. But I [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3260.64s)]
*  think it's a question worth asking for sure. Is it worth [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3264.88s)]
*  slowing down though, sex? Should we be pausing? Because based on [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3267.32s)]
*  what you said, I think you've framed it properly. When these [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3271.6400000000003s)]
*  things hit a certain point, and they start reinforcing their own [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3274.4s)]
*  learning with each other, they can go at infinite speed, right? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3277.4s)]
*  This is not comparable to human speed, they could be firing off [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3281.32s)]
*  millions, billions of different scenarios, we're definitely now [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3285.28s)]
*  on this fuck around, find out curve. Yeah. And so there's only [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3289.56s)]
*  one way to really find out which is somebody's going to push the [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3294.8s)]
*  boundaries, the competitive dynamics will get the better of [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3299.0s)]
*  some startup, they'll do something that people will look [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3302.1200000000003s)]
*  back on and say, Whoa, that was a little that was a bridge too [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3306.0800000000004s)]
*  far. So yeah, we're just just a matter of time. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3308.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're not going to slow down. I actually think it's [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3312.6800000000003s)]
*  going the other way. I think things are going to speed up. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3315.6400000000003s)]
*  And the reason they're going to speed up is because the one [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3317.44s)]
*  thing Silicon Valley is really good at is taking advantage of a [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3320.52s)]
*  platform shift. And so when you think about like all the VCs, and [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3323.72s)]
*  all the founders, you know, everyone accuses us of being [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3328.12s)]
*  lemmings. And so when there's like kind of like a fake platform [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3331.08s)]
*  shift, or people kind of glom onto something that ends up not [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3336.04s)]
*  being real, everyone's kind of got egg on their faces. But the [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3339.2s)]
*  flip side of that is that when the platform shift is real, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3341.9599999999996s)]
*  Silicon Valley is really good at throwing money at it, the [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3345.24s)]
*  talent knows how to go after it. And they keep making it better [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3348.48s)]
*  and better. And so that's the dynamic we're in right now. You [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3352.16s)]
*  look at 70% of the last YC class was ready all AI startups for the [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3355.6s)]
*  next one probably be 95%. So I think that we're on a path here [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3359.24s)]
*  where the pace of innovation is actually going to speed up. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3363.72s)]
*  Companies are going to compete with each other, they're going to [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3366.96s)]
*  seek to invent new capabilities. And I think the results are [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3368.92s)]
*  going to all be incredibly positive for some period of time, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3372.2s)]
*  like you know, the vet example, we're going to cure illnesses, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3376.44s)]
*  we're going to solve major problems. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3379.6s)]
*  Positive, then we invest more, we trust more. But the paradox [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3381.6s)]
*  of that as Chamath is pointing out Freiburg is if we trust it [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3386.3199999999997s)]
*  more, we invest more than some person in a free market is going [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3389.08s)]
*  to say, you know what, I need to be chat GPT. Therefore, I'm [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3392.7999999999997s)]
*  going to take the rails off this thing, I'm going to let it go [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3396.04s)]
*  faster, and take off some constraints, because I need to [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3398.48s)]
*  win. And I'm so far behind. How do you feel about that scenario [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3401.7999999999997s)]
*  that sort of Chamath and Sachs teed up Freiburg? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3406.24s)]
*  I think there's like GPT three, I think ran on 700 gigs, is that [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3408.68s)]
*  right? Does anyone know if GPT four runs on it's got to be on [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3417.2s)]
*  some number that's, you know, not too not not many multiples of [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3421.7599999999998s)]
*  that. But look, someone could make a copy of this thing and [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3425.7999999999997s)]
*  fork it and develop an entirely new model. I think that's what's [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3432.08s)]
*  incredible about software and digital technology and also kind [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3436.2s)]
*  of, you know, means that it's very hard to contain. Similar to [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3442.04s)]
*  like what we've seen in biology ever since biology got digitized [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3446.6s)]
*  through DNA sequencing, and the ability to kind of express [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3450.3599999999997s)]
*  molecules through gene editing. You know, you can't control or [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3453.8799999999997s)]
*  contain the ability to do gene editing work at all. Because [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3459.0s)]
*  everyone knows the code. Everyone can make CRISPR cas [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3462.56s)]
*  molecules, everyone can make gene editing systems in any lab [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3466.44s)]
*  anywhere. Once it was out, it was out. And now there's hundreds [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3469.4s)]
*  of variants for doing gene editing, many of which are much [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3473.6s)]
*  improved over CRISPR cas9. I use that as an analogy, because it [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3476.96s)]
*  was this breakthrough technology that allowed us to precisely [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3480.2799999999997s)]
*  specifically edit genomes. And that allowed us to engineer [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3483.12s)]
*  biology and do these incredible things where biology effectively [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3485.68s)]
*  became software. And remember CRISPR cas9 gave us effectively [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3488.68s)]
*  a word processing type tool find and replace. And the tooling [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3492.84s)]
*  that's evolved from that is much better. So whatever is [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3497.92s)]
*  underlying, whatever the parameters are for GPT-4, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3501.6000000000004s)]
*  whatever that model is, if a close enough replicant of that [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3506.44s)]
*  model exists, or a copy of that model is made, and then new [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3511.04s)]
*  training data and new evolutions can be done separately, you [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3514.2000000000003s)]
*  could see many, many variants that kind of emerge from here. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3517.28s)]
*  And I think this is a good echoing of Chamath's point, we [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3519.6s)]
*  don't know what's ultimately going to win. Is there enough of [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3521.92s)]
*  a network effect in the plug-in model, as Sachs pointed out, to [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3525.12s)]
*  really give open AI the sustaining competitive [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3527.96s)]
*  advantage? I'm not sure. The model runs on 700 gigs. That's [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3530.2799999999997s)]
*  less data than, you know, fits on my iPhone. So you know, I [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3534.52s)]
*  could take that model, I could take the parameters of that [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3538.52s)]
*  model, and I could create an entirely new version, I could [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3540.6s)]
*  fork it, and I could do something entirely new with it. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3543.04s)]
*  So I don't think you can contain it. I don't think that this idea [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3545.3199999999997s)]
*  that we can put in place some regulatory constraints and say [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3549.36s)]
*  it's illegal to do this, or, you know, try and, you know, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3553.44s)]
*  create IP around it or protections around it is [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3557.52s)]
*  realistic at this state. The power of the tool is so [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3560.2000000000003s)]
*  extraordinary, the extendability of the tools are so [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3562.92s)]
*  extraordinary. So the economic and the other various incentives [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3565.1600000000003s)]
*  are there for, you know, other models to emerge, and whether [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3568.8s)]
*  they're directly copied from someone hacking into open AI [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3573.1600000000003s)]
*  servers and making a copy of that model, or whether they're, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3576.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, open sourced or whether that someone generates [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3578.76s)]
*  something that's 95% is good, and then it forks and a whole [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3580.96s)]
*  new class of models emerge. I think this is like, it's as [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3584.04s)]
*  Sachs pointed out, highlighting the kind of economic market [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3588.44s)]
*  uprooting, social uprooting potential, and many models will [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3592.36s)]
*  start to kind of come to market. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3596.28s)]
*  What do we think the impact of white collar jobs getting [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3598.0s)]
*  annihilated by this technology, if that in fact, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3600.64s)]
*  I want to say one thing on this. Yeah, look, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3603.0s)]
*  well, let me just share, just give one example here. So here's [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3604.52s)]
*  a Reddit post that I was made aware of earlier this week. I [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3607.24s)]
*  lost everything that made me love my job through mid journey [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3611.24s)]
*  overnight. I am employed as a 3d artist in a small games [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3613.9599999999996s)]
*  company of 10 people. Our team is two people he basically [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3617.04s)]
*  explains. He says since mid journey version five came out, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3619.7999999999997s)]
*  he's not an artist anymore, nor a 3d artist. All they do is [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3623.8399999999997s)]
*  prompting photoshopping and implementing good looking [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3627.3999999999996s)]
*  pictures. And he basically says, this happened overnight, and he [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3630.08s)]
*  had no choice. His boss also had no choice. He says I am now [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3634.04s)]
*  able to create rig and animate a character that spit out from MJ [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3637.4s)]
*  mid journey in two to three days before it took us several weeks [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3641.8s)]
*  in 3d. The difference is that he cares about his you know, job [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3644.44s)]
*  and for his boss is just a huge time money saver. He's no longer [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3647.8s)]
*  making art and the person who was number two in the [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3651.0s)]
*  organization who didn't make as good content as him is now [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3653.48s)]
*  embracing this technology because it carries favor with his [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3656.68s)]
*  boss. And he ends basically saying, getting a job in the [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3660.0s)]
*  game industry is already hard, but leaving a company and a [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3664.2s)]
*  nice team because AI took my job feels very dystopian. I doubt it [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3666.88s)]
*  would be better in a different company. Also, I am between [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3671.52s)]
*  grief and anger and I'm sorry for using my gosh, your art [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3674.32s)]
*  fellow artists. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3677.76s)]
*  This is yet another reason that Figma really needs to close this [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3678.64s)]
*  acquisition from Adobe. I mean, it's like, the value of these [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3683.6s)]
*  apps are just getting gutted. If you take a workflow management [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3687.24s)]
*  tool for things like design and imagery, and you reduce it by an [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3691.4799999999996s)]
*  order of 90%, it's like, what is that app experience worth? And [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3696.68s)]
*  how could you replicate it if you were a big company that [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3701.9199999999996s)]
*  already has distribution? That's one comment. But what I would [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3705.8399999999997s)]
*  tell you, Jason, to answer the white collar question is I think [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3708.8799999999997s)]
*  there are a handful of companies you need to look at exclusively, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3711.3999999999996s)]
*  because they will be the first ones to really figure out how to [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3715.2s)]
*  displace human labor. And that is TCS, so Tata Consulting [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3717.68s)]
*  Services, Accenture, Cognizant. These are all the folks that do [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3722.48s)]
*  coding for hire work at scale. I think Accenture has something [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3728.88s)]
*  like 750,000 employees. So the incentive to sort of squeeze [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3732.08s)]
*  op-acs to create better utilization rates, to increase [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3737.16s)]
*  profitability is quite obvious. It always has been. They will be [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3740.92s)]
*  the first people to figure out how to use these tools at scale. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3745.12s)]
*  Before the law firms or the accounting firms or any of those [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3748.6s)]
*  folks even sort of try to figure out how to displace white collar [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3751.16s)]
*  labor, I think it's going to be the coding jobs. And it's going [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3754.32s)]
*  to be the coding for hire jobs that companies like Accenture [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3756.36s)]
*  and TCS. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3759.32s)]
*  So those business processing, developer kind of folks, they're [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3760.12s)]
*  going to need half as many people, 25% as many people, we're [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3764.52s)]
*  going to find out the efficient frontier. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3768.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3770.4s)]
*  I see it a different way. I mean, this argument that [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3771.36s)]
*  productivity leads to job loss has been made for hundreds of [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3774.4s)]
*  years. And it's always been refuted. When you make human [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3777.0s)]
*  beings more productive, it leads to more prosperity, more wealth, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3780.48s)]
*  growth, more growth. And so yeah, it's easy to think about [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3783.44s)]
*  in a narrow way, the jobs are going to be displaced. But why [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3787.28s)]
*  would that be? It's because you're giving leverage to other [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3790.6s)]
*  human beings to get more done. And some of those human beings, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3793.28s)]
*  really anybody with a good idea is now going to be able to [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3796.68s)]
*  create a startup much more easily. So you're going to see a [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3799.88s)]
*  huge explosion in creativity in startup creation, new companies, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3802.6800000000003s)]
*  new jobs. Imagine think about the case of, you know, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3807.52s)]
*  Zuckerberg founding Facebook at Harvard, he wrote the first [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3810.56s)]
*  version himself, maybe with a couple of friends, that project [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3814.4s)]
*  happened and turned into a giant company because he was able to [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3818.12s)]
*  self execute his idea without needing to raise venture [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3820.84s)]
*  capital or even recruit employees, even really before [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3824.88s)]
*  forming a company, anyone with a good idea to be able to do that [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3829.1600000000003s)]
*  soon, you're going to be able to use these AI tools, they truly [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3831.6000000000004s)]
*  will be no code, you'll be able to create an app or a website [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3834.36s)]
*  just by speaking to some AI program in a natural language [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3838.28s)]
*  way. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3840.76s)]
*  So more flowers will bloom, more startups will bloom more [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3841.04s)]
*  projects. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3843.6000000000004s)]
*  Now, it will create, I think a lot of dislocation, but for [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3844.36s)]
*  every testimonial that is like the one that you showed, which I [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3849.0800000000004s)]
*  think is, I'd say a little bit overly dramatic, I have seen 10 [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3853.0s)]
*  or 100 testimonials from coders on Twitter or other blogs, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3857.04s)]
*  talking about the power that these new tools give them. They [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3862.48s)]
*  are like, this makes me a 10x engineer, right? And especially [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3865.7599999999998s)]
*  these like junior engineers who write out school, who don't have [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3869.2799999999997s)]
*  20 years of coding history, they get superpowers right away. Like [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3872.12s)]
*  it makes them so much better. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3876.24s)]
*  So let's drop a response from this. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3877.36s)]
*  Let me give you a response to that guy. So and using Sachs's [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3880.2s)]
*  point, that guy's saying what used to take me weeks, I can now [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3883.24s)]
*  do in two to three days. And I feel like my work is gone. And [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3886.9199999999996s)]
*  that's because he's thinking in terms of his output being [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3890.3599999999997s)]
*  static. And if he thinks about his output being dynamic, he can [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3893.16s)]
*  now in the matter of three weeks, instead of making one [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3897.6s)]
*  character, he can now make a character every two days. So he [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3900.3199999999997s)]
*  can make 30 characters in three weeks. That's an alternative way [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3903.3999999999996s)]
*  for him to think about what this tooling does for him and his [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3906.72s)]
*  business. The number of video games will go up by 10x or 100x [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3910.12s)]
*  or 1000x. The number of movies and videos that can be rendered [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3914.3599999999997s)]
*  in computers can go up by 10x or 100x or 1000x. This is why I [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3917.48s)]
*  really believe strongly that at some period of time, we will all [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3921.6s)]
*  have our own movie or our own video game ultimately generated [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3925.8399999999997s)]
*  for us on the fly. Based on our particular interests, there will [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3928.64s)]
*  certainly be shared culture, shared themes, you know, shared [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3931.72s)]
*  morality, shared things that that tie all these things [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3935.48s)]
*  together. And that will become the shared experience. But in [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3938.6s)]
*  terms of like us all consuming the same content, it will really [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3941.96s)]
*  like you with YouTube and tik tok, we're all consuming [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3945.04s)]
*  different stuff all the time. And this will enable an [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3947.36s)]
*  acceleration of that evolution and personalization. I'll also [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3949.7599999999998s)]
*  highlight, you know, back in the day, one human had to farm a [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3953.56s)]
*  farm by hand. And we eventually got the tool of a hoe and we [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3957.44s)]
*  could put in the ground and make, you know, make stuff [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3960.72s)]
*  faster. And then we got a plow. And then we got a tractor. And [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3963.0s)]
*  today, agricultural farm equipment allows one farmer to [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3967.8s)]
*  farm over 10,000 acres, you go to Western Australia, it's [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3972.44s)]
*  incredible. These guys have 24 row planters and harvesters. And [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3974.8s)]
*  it's completely changed the game. So the unit of output per [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3977.84s)]
*  farmer is now literally millions of times what it was just 150. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3980.88s)]
*  In that case, free book, nobody wants to do backbreaking labor [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3985.5600000000004s)]
*  in the fields and everybody wants that. But in this case, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3989.28s)]
*  let me just read you one quote that I didn't read in the [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3992.7200000000003s)]
*  original reading of this. He says, I want to make art that [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3994.72s)]
*  isn't the result of scraped internet content from artists [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=3998.6s)]
*  that were not asked. And so I think that's part of this is [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4001.24s)]
*  that it's bespoke art. But the one question I have for Sachs was [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4004.4399999999996s)]
*  Sachs, you we started this conversation, we're saying, hey, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4009.56s)]
*  this is different than anything in terms of efficiency that came [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4012.3199999999997s)]
*  before it. This is, I'm going to put some words in my ear, but [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4015.04s)]
*  this is like a step function, more efficient. So to the [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4017.9199999999996s)]
*  argument of, hey, efficiency has always resulted in, you know, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4021.04s)]
*  more ideas, and we've found something to do with people's [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4026.2799999999997s)]
*  time is this time different potentially, because this is so [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4028.92s)]
*  much more powerful. This isn't just like a spell checker. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4032.32s)]
*  I would say differently, I think and I agree with what J Cal is [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4034.56s)]
*  saying, because I think that the thing that technology has never [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4037.16s)]
*  done is try to displace human judgment. It's allowed us to [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4041.68s)]
*  replace physical exertion of energy, but it has always [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4047.96s)]
*  preserved humans injecting our judgment. And I think this is [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4052.16s)]
*  the first time where we're being challenged with autonomous [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4056.48s)]
*  systems that has some level of judgment. Now we can say, and [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4060.4s)]
*  it's true, again, we're four months in, that that judgment [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4065.48s)]
*  isn't so great. But eventually, and because of the pace of [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4068.6s)]
*  innovation, eventually is probably not that far away. But [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4073.64s)]
*  judgment will become perfect. I'll give you a totally different [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4076.88s)]
*  example, you know, how many pilots are there in the world? [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4079.76s)]
*  Will we, at some point in the next 10 years, want folks to [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4082.6s)]
*  actually manually take off and land or will we want precision [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4089.32s)]
*  guided instrumentation and computers and sensors that can [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4093.28s)]
*  guarantee a pitch perfect landing every single time in [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4096.8s)]
*  all kinds of weather conditions so that now planes can even have [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4099.24s)]
*  50x the number of sensors with a computer that can then process [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4102.44s)]
*  it and act accordingly, just a random example that isn't even [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4105.919999999999s)]
*  thought of when we talk about sort of where AI is going to [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4109.24s)]
*  rear its head. I think that this judgment idea is an important [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4112.04s)]
*  one to figure out, because this is the first time I've seen [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4115.5199999999995s)]
*  something that is bumping up against our ability to have [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4118.08s)]
*  judgment. And what this person was talking about in this mid [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4121.679999999999s)]
*  journey example is his judgment has been usurped. Yes, that's [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4124.2s)]
*  judgment has been usurped. Yes. Yeah, I would disagree. So like, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4129.44s)]
*  yeah, let me just let me just make one point on this. So, you [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4134.44s)]
*  know, an image is a matrix of, you know, data that's rendered [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4138.16s)]
*  on a screen and as pixels and those pixels are different [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4142.919999999999s)]
*  colors. And, you know, that's what an image is. Is it or is it [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4145.679999999999s)]
*  is it the judgment of the creator? Well, no, I'm just [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4149.48s)]
*  saying an image in general. So like when Adobe Photoshop and [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4151.839999999999s)]
*  digital photography arose, photographers were like, this is, [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4154.4s)]
*  you know, bs, why are you digitizing photography was analog [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4158.0s)]
*  and beautiful before. And then what digital photography allowed [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4160.96s)]
*  is the photographer to do editing and to do work that was [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4164.08s)]
*  creative beyond what was possible with just a natural [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4168.24s)]
*  photograph taken through a camera. And they're arguably [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4171.12s)]
*  different art forms, but it was a new kind of art form that [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4173.52s)]
*  emerged through digital photography. And then in the [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4175.56s)]
*  early 90s, there was a plugin suite called Kai's power tools [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4178.16s)]
*  that came out in Adobe Photoshop. And it was a third [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4182.4800000000005s)]
*  party plugin set, you would you would buy it and then it would [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4185.12s)]
*  work on Photoshop and it did things like motion blur, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4187.88s)]
*  sharpening, pixelation, all these interesting kind of like [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4190.5599999999995s)]
*  features. And prior to those tools coming out, the judgment [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4193.76s)]
*  of the digital artist, the digital photographer was to go [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4197.5199999999995s)]
*  in and do pixel by pixel changes on the image to make that pixel [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4200.04s)]
*  to make that image look blurry, or to make it look sharper, or [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4203.92s)]
*  to make it look like it had some really interesting motion [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4206.96s)]
*  feature. And the power tools created this instant toolkit [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4209.04s)]
*  where in a few seconds, you created a blur on the image. And [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4212.8s)]
*  that was an incredible toolkit. But a lot of digital artists [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4215.92s)]
*  said, this is automating my work. What is my point now? Why am I [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4219.320000000001s)]
*  here? And the same happened in animation when three, when you [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4223.0s)]
*  know, CGI came around, and animators were no longer [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4226.320000000001s)]
*  animating cells by hand. And in every point in this evolution, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4228.6s)]
*  there was a feeling of loss initially, but then the evolution [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4232.24s)]
*  of a whole new art form emerged and an evolution of a whole new [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4235.08s)]
*  area of human creative expression emerged. And I think [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4237.88s)]
*  we don't yet know what that's gonna look like. Do you think [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4240.72s)]
*  sorry, do you think the the level of judgment that AI [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4242.96s)]
*  offers you is the same as the level of judgment that Kai power [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4247.52s)]
*  tools offered? Yeah, look, I mean, I think that the person [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4250.4800000000005s)]
*  making the judgment or the decision about which pixel to [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4252.56s)]
*  change into what color felt like, you know, I have control. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4254.88s)]
*  And I think it's ultimately like, I just told her I [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4257.68s)]
*  disagree with you. I mean, I think that this is a magnitude [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4260.0s)]
*  different. It's more of a than a magnitude. Yeah, it's a high [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4262.4800000000005s)]
*  level. It's still love. It's on you. You know, you and I, you [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4266.64s)]
*  and I have sat in spreadsheets. And we've I'm generally happy [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4270.0s)]
*  with this idea. So I'll give you a different example. Today, we [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4273.2s)]
*  use radiologists and pathologists to identify [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4276.44s)]
*  cancers. Yep. There are closed loop systems, we have one right [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4279.32s)]
*  now that's in front of the FDA. That is a total closed loop [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4284.08s)]
*  system that will not need any human input. So I don't know [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4286.96s)]
*  what those folks do. Except what I can tell you is that we can [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4292.16s)]
*  get cancer detection, basically down to a 0% error rate. That [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4297.2s)]
*  is not possible with human intervention. That is judgment. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4301.679999999999s)]
*  Right. So I just think it's important to really acknowledge [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4306.5599999999995s)]
*  that this is happening at a level that it's never happened [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4310.0s)]
*  before. You may be right that there's some amazing job for [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4312.32s)]
*  that radiologist or pathologist to do in the future. I don't [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4316.0s)]
*  know offhand what that is. But these are closed loop systems [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4319.88s)]
*  now that think for themselves and self improve. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4324.24s)]
*  I get it. But I think that there there's an unfathomable set of [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4326.96s)]
*  things that emerge. We did not have the concept of Instagram [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4330.36s)]
*  influencers. We did not have the concept of personal trainers. We [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4333.639999999999s)]
*  did not have the concept of like, all these new jobs that [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4338.24s)]
*  have emerged in the past couple of decades, that people enjoy [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4341.12s)]
*  doing that they can make money doing that is a greater kind of [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4344.48s)]
*  experience and level of fulfillment for those that [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4348.08s)]
*  choose and have the freedom to do it than what they were having [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4350.16s)]
*  to do before when they had to work just to make money. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4353.0s)]
*  What do you think that radiologist or pathologist wants [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4356.24s)]
*  to do be a trainer or Pilates instructor? No, I think that's [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4358.68s)]
*  crazy. That's gonna look like. All right, yeah. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4361.6s)]
*  You have any thoughts on this? As we wrap this topic? It's [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4365.4s)]
*  obviously a lot of passion coming out. Yeah, elimination of [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4367.88s)]
*  white collar jobs in a massive way. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4370.76s)]
*  I think that this is a short term versus long term thing in [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4372.88s)]
*  the short term. I see the benefits of AI being very [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4375.48s)]
*  positive because I don't think it's in most cases wiping out [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4378.32s)]
*  human jobs. This is making them way more productive. You still [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4382.36s)]
*  need the developer. It's just that there are five times or 10x [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4385.32s)]
*  more productive, but I don't think we're at the point in the [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4388.599999999999s)]
*  short term, we're going to eliminate that role entirely. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4391.92s)]
*  And what I've seen in basically every startup I've ever been a [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4395.12s)]
*  part of is that the limiting factor on progress is always [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4397.96s)]
*  engineering bandwidth. That is always the thing that you wish [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4401.88s)]
*  you had more of. Totally. It's the product roadmap is always [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4405.639999999999s)]
*  the most competed on thing inside the organization. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4408.639999999999s)]
*  Everyone's trying to get their project prioritized because [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4411.16s)]
*  there's never enough engineering bandwidth. It's really the [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4414.599999999999s)]
*  lifeblood of the company. So if you make the developers more [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4417.04s)]
*  productive, and maybe just accelerate the product roadmap, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4420.5199999999995s)]
*  I just, I don't think in the short term, that what's going to [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4422.88s)]
*  happen is these companies are going to look to cut all their [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4425.76s)]
*  developers because one or two of them can do 10x the work. I [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4428.48s)]
*  think that they're going to try and accelerate their product [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4431.96s)]
*  roadmaps. Now, again, you have this long term concern that [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4434.92s)]
*  maybe you don't need developers at all at some point. But I [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4438.44s)]
*  think that the benefits of developing this technology are [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4441.4s)]
*  so great in the short to mid term that we're going down that [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4444.48s)]
*  path no matter what. And we're just going to find out what that [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4447.28s)]
*  long term really looks like. And maybe the long term will look [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4450.12s)]
*  very different. I mean, once we get past the short term, we may [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4453.16s)]
*  have a different long term view. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4457.5199999999995s)]
*  I think in this narrow vertical, I 100% agree with you. Look, I [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4459.5199999999995s)]
*  think that AI is going to eliminate unit testing. It has [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4462.839999999999s)]
*  already done so it's going to eliminate most forms of coding, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4466.28s)]
*  the engineers that you have, all of them will now become 10x [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4469.32s)]
*  engineers. So with fewer of them, or with the same number, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4472.4s)]
*  you'll be able to do as much or more than you could have before. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4476.16s)]
*  That's a wonderful thing. And all I'm saying on that specific [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4478.96s)]
*  narrow vertical is you'll see it first rear its head in companies [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4481.5599999999995s)]
*  like Accenture and TCS because and Cognizant because they have [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4484.88s)]
*  an immediate incentive to use this tooling to drive efficiency [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4489.0s)]
*  and profitability that's rewarded by shareholders, it'll [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4493.52s)]
*  be less visible in other companies. So but what I am [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4497.120000000001s)]
*  saying though, is that you have to think about the impact on the [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4500.080000000001s)]
*  end markets for a second. And I think that AI does something [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4503.4800000000005s)]
*  that other technology layers have never done before, which is [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4508.52s)]
*  supplant human judgment in a closed loop manner. And I just [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4512.6s)]
*  think it's worth appreciating that there are many systems and [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4516.080000000001s)]
*  many jobs that reply that rely on human judgment. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4518.56s)]
*  Where we deal with error bars, and an error rate that a [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4523.68s)]
*  computer will just destroy and blow out of the water. And we [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4529.280000000001s)]
*  will have to ask ourselves, should this classic job exist [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4532.88s)]
*  with its inherent error rate? Or should it get replaced fully by [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4536.72s)]
*  a computer which has no error rate? And I think that's an [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4540.240000000001s)]
*  important question that's worth putting on the table. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4542.72s)]
*  Okay, so let's wrap here. I just have my final thought on it is [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4545.0s)]
*  like, you're going to see entire jobs, categories of jobs go away. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4547.64s)]
*  We've seen this before phone operators, travel agents, copy [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4551.76s)]
*  editors, illustrators, logo designers, accountants, sales [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4555.360000000001s)]
*  development reps, I'm seeing a lot of these job functions in [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4558.0s)]
*  the modern world, like phone operators previously, I think [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4561.400000000001s)]
*  these could wholesale just go away, and they would just be [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4565.04s)]
*  done by AI. And I think it's going to happen in a very short [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4567.320000000001s)]
*  period of time. And so it's going to be about who can [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4569.56s)]
*  transition. And some people might not be able to make the [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4571.52s)]
*  transition, and that's going to be pain and suffering. And it's [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4574.0s)]
*  going to be in the white collar ranks. And those people have [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4575.84s)]
*  more influence. So I think this is could lead to some societal [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4578.280000000001s)]
*  disturbance. I'm going to learn Pilates and be an influencer. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4581.04s)]
*  That's it. But I do agree with Sachs that the software [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4585.32s)]
*  development backlog, if this is what you're saying is so great, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4587.84s)]
*  that I don't think we'll see it in software development for a [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4590.8s)]
*  decade or two, there's just so much software that still needs [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4593.0s)]
*  to be made. All right, last week, we talked about TikTok. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4594.96s)]
*  And this first bipartisan hearing we've seen in a long [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4597.56s)]
*  time. And people actually, I think framing correctly exactly [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4599.96s)]
*  how dangerous it is, in my opinion, to have TikTok in the [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4604.08s)]
*  United States. And of course, then we get the great [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4606.44s)]
*  disappointment of the actual bill, their strict act was [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4610.56s)]
*  proposed by Senator Mark Warner, Democrat Virginia, on March 7. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4614.160000000001s)]
*  The problem with it is, is it seems like it's poorly worded [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4618.52s)]
*  that there will be civil penalties and criminal penalties [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4622.080000000001s)]
*  to Americans for breaking the law and using software that's [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4625.52s)]
*  been banned. And many people said, you know, this probably is [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4630.68s)]
*  just bad language. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4635.080000000001s)]
*  I have a question. Yeah, go ahead. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4636.240000000001s)]
*  Does this apply to incognito mode? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4637.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4642.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4643.92s)]
*  They're saying that you can get, you know, you can get fined or [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4646.0s)]
*  20 years in jail, whatever it is, for using a VPN to VPN to [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4649.320000000001s)]
*  TikTok. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4654.120000000001s)]
*  Freiburg, what are your thoughts on it? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4654.64s)]
*  Look, I think this is a real threat to the open internet. I'm [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4655.8s)]
*  really concerned about the language that's been used, that [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4658.6s)]
*  basically speaks to protecting the safety and security of the [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4662.64s)]
*  American people by actively monitoring network traffic and [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4665.44s)]
*  making decisions about what network traffic is and isn't [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4669.48s)]
*  allowed to be transmitted across the open internet. It's the [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4672.24s)]
*  first time that I think in the United States, we are seeing [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4675.44s)]
*  like a real threat and a real set of behaviors from our [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4678.48s)]
*  government that looks and feels a lot like what goes on in China [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4680.759999999999s)]
*  and elsewhere, where they operate with a closed internet [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4684.5599999999995s)]
*  and internet that's controlled, monitored, observed, tracked, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4687.0s)]
*  and, and gates are decided by some set of administrators on [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4691.16s)]
*  what is and isn't appropriate. And the language is always the [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4694.8s)]
*  same. It's for safety and security of the people. The [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4697.76s)]
*  entire purpose of the internet is that it did not have bounds, [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4700.68s)]
*  that it did not have governments, that it did not have [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4703.52s)]
*  controls, that it did not have systems that are politically and [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4705.76s)]
*  economically influenced, that the architecture of the internet [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4709.04s)]
*  was and always would be open, the protocols are open, the [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4711.84s)]
*  transmission of data on that network would be open. And as a [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4714.92s)]
*  result, all people around the world would have access to [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4718.28s)]
*  information of their choosing, and it allowed ultimate freedom [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4720.68s)]
*  of choice. You know, this this kind of is the first of what I'm [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4724.16s)]
*  concerned, creates a precedent that ultimately leads to a very [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4727.76s)]
*  slippery slope. Saying that TikTok cannot make money in the [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4730.84s)]
*  US by charging advertisers or managing commerce flows is one [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4733.84s)]
*  thing. That's where the government can and should and [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4737.28s)]
*  could if they chose to have a role. But I think going in and [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4739.4s)]
*  observing tracking internet traffic and making decisions [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4742.88s)]
*  about what is and isn't appropriate for people, I think, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4745.64s)]
*  is one of the things that we all should be most concerned about [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4749.48s)]
*  what's going on right now. There is no end in sight to this, if [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4752.52s)]
*  you allow this to happen in the first time. You know, VPNs, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4756.4800000000005s)]
*  virtual private networks allow you to anonymously access [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4760.52s)]
*  internet traffic and and access internet traffic via remote [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4764.280000000001s)]
*  destinations. So so that the ultimate consumption of content [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4769.360000000001s)]
*  that you're using can't be tracked and monitored by local [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4774.120000000001s)]
*  agencies or ISPs. And I think that saying that that can now be [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4778.320000000001s)]
*  restricted, takes away all ability to have true privacy and [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4781.88s)]
*  all rights to privacy on the open internet. So I'd love to [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4785.08s)]
*  talk about this more. Unfortunately, I got to run. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4790.12s)]
*  Great thing. This is a super threat to me. And I think this [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4792.32s)]
*  is something we should be super, super concerned about. And that [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4795.12s)]
*  the entire community of technology, internet, and anyone [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4798.08s)]
*  that wants to have, you know, freedom of choice, steps up and [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4801.76s)]
*  says this is totally inappropriate and overreach. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4804.72s)]
*  Yeah, there are other ways to manage stuff like [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4807.400000000001s)]
*  like complete overreach sex. Yeah, intentional overreach or [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4809.24s)]
*  poorly written or somewhere in between. What do you think? [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4813.92s)]
*  Both? I think both. I think this is the biggest bait and [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4815.92s)]
*  switch that Washington, the central government's ever tried [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4818.76s)]
*  to pull on us. Everybody thinks that they're just trying to ban [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4822.0s)]
*  tik tok from operating in the US. And if that's all they did, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4825.04s)]
*  then I think the bill would be supported by most Americans. But [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4828.08s)]
*  that's not what they're doing. They're not restricting tik [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4830.76s)]
*  tok. They're restricting us. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4833.4s)]
*  That's not the goal here. Yeah. What a bait switch. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4835.5199999999995s)]
*  It's a huge bait and switch. And so just so you know, what the [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4838.48s)]
*  act provides is that a US citizen using a VPN to access [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4840.96s)]
*  tik tok could theoretically be subjected to a maximum penalty [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4845.44s)]
*  of 1 million in fines, or 20 years in prison or both. Now, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4848.759999999999s)]
*  you know, they'll say, you know, Mark Warner, the sponsor of [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4853.48s)]
*  legislation will swear up and down. That's not the intent. But [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4856.679999999999s)]
*  the problem is that the language of the bill is so vague, that [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4859.639999999999s)]
*  some clever prosecutor may want to pursue this theory one day. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4862.5599999999995s)]
*  And that needs to be stopped. Also, there's another problem [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4866.4800000000005s)]
*  with the bill, which is you think this is just about tik [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4869.52s)]
*  tok. It's not what they do is, it says here, I guess they don't [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4872.12s)]
*  want to mention tik tok by name. So they're trying to create a [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4877.4s)]
*  category of threatening application. But because it is a [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4880.24s)]
*  category, it's very, very broad. So the bill states that it [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4884.04s)]
*  covers any transaction, transaction, not just an app, in [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4888.08s)]
*  which an entity described in subparagraph B has any interest. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4893.08s)]
*  And then entities described in subparagraph B are quote, a [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4897.08s)]
*  foreign adversary, an entity subject to the jurisdiction of [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4899.64s)]
*  organizing the laws of a foreign adversary, an entity owned [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4903.28s)]
*  director controlled by either of these. And then it gives the [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4906.24s)]
*  executive branch, the power to name a foreign adversary, any [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4909.8s)]
*  foreign government regime that one of the cabinet secretaries [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4915.96s)]
*  defines without any vote of Congress. So this is giving [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4919.08s)]
*  sweeping powers to the executive branch to declare, you know, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4923.0s)]
*  foreign companies to be enemies. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4927.6s)]
*  It feels like the plot of the prequels in Star Wars. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4929.2s)]
*  Well, like T-Burg said, [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4931.8s)]
*  here we go. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4932.88s)]
*  You know, we criticize China for having a great firewall. What [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4934.08s)]
*  do you think this is? [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4937.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this this should obviously have nothing to do [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4938.72s)]
*  with the American consumer and everything to do with a foreign [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4941.84s)]
*  adversary collecting data of Americans at scale. This could [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4944.24s)]
*  be written in a much simpler way. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4947.84s)]
*  You know, it should be one sentence, which is that app [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4949.64s)]
*  stores are prohibited from allowing TikTok be an app in [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4953.08s)]
*  their store. That's what they do in India. That's it. Case closed [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4957.04s)]
*  game over. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4959.96s)]
*  I think India is doing okay, right? They block like 100 [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4960.4800000000005s)]
*  Chinese apps. And I think their society is still functioning. So [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4963.04s)]
*  you know, all due respect to AOC, you know, like the idea [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4966.16s)]
*  that 150 Americans million Americans are going to suffer [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4969.400000000001s)]
*  because they can't be tracked by the CCP is kind of nuts. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4971.84s)]
*  This is going to give sweeping powers to the security state to [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4974.719999999999s)]
*  surveil us to prosecute us to limit our usage. This is [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4980.32s)]
*  basically the biggest power grab and bait and switch they've ever [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4985.679999999999s)]
*  tried to pull on us. And again, if they really were concerned [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4988.799999999999s)]
*  about TikTok, it's one sentence. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4991.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we were done. All right, everybody. It's been an amazing [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4993.679999999999s)]
*  episode for the Sultan of Science David Friberg, the rain man of [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=4996.48s)]

*  time. Bye bye. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=5008.04s)]
*  These are dog. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=5030.6s)]
*  Like this like sexual tension, but they just need to release [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ544sWC8ZQ&t=5044.84s)]
