*  PG defines the world now in two ways two philosophies for running a company manager mode versus founder mode in manager mode [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=580.62s)]
*  That's just the conventional way of doing this what you teach in business school. You hire good people you give them room to do their jobs [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=588.98s)]
*  You tell your direct reports what to do. They figure it out. You don't micromanage [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=594.62s)]
*  Pichi says it doesn't give too many specifics about founder mode. He kind of says hey, we got to figure out what this thing is [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=598.8199999999999s)]
*  so in some ways this blog post to mouth was a way of starting the conversation, but he said things like [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=605.06s)]
*  less delegation and more hands-on and [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=611.9799999999999s)]
*  If you haven't heard of it skip level meetings [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=614.8199999999999s)]
*  This is where the CEO will meet not with their manager a direct report [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=616.9399999999999s)]
*  But maybe a group of people who report into that manager without the manager in the room [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=621.5s)]
*  Notable and well-known [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=626.28s)]
*  management technique to kind of get information to the CEO a little bit faster and [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=628.68s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=634.76s)]
*  Chum office got a lot of attention on a Sunday [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=636.8s)]
*  Did you have any takeaways from I was confused when I read it? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=640.56s)]
*  Because everybody was breathlessly panting about how [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=647.16s)]
*  Incredibly insightful it was and when I read it my first thought was where's the second half that actually explains what this is so that you [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=650.84s)]
*  Can have an opinion and then the next thing I thought was I don't really understand [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=657.26s)]
*  What any of this is all about and I tweeted this in a quarter century now in Silicon Valley. I think I've encountered [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=661.76s)]
*  Two different kinds of people one are the groups of people that can go right to the heart of issues because they can break things [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=669.12s)]
*  down and look at it from first principles and [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=675.48s)]
*  Just [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=678.24s)]
*  Ruthlessly attack what's not working with absolutely no nostalgia for people or [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=679.8399999999999s)]
*  sunk cost or tech debt and [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=685.8399999999999s)]
*  Then there's everybody else and I think that that is an archetype that actually drives successful companies [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=688.5999999999999s)]
*  It's not the case that those are only exhibited in founders. I [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=696.76s)]
*  think it's a psychological makeup of a person and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=701.04s)]
*  The people that have it tend to build good companies [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=704.88s)]
*  You know will have such a person for example at the all-in-summit [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=708.1999999999999s)]
*  If you look at what Nikesh Aurora was able to do at Palo Alto Networks, it's true. It's incredible [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=713.12s)]
*  I mean in eight years, he's created 80 billion dollars of value. How do you do that? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=718.24s)]
*  I think it's important to understand how that happens [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=722.48s)]
*  If you look at a whole bunch of other people that are managers Shantanu Narayan, how has he built Adobe? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=727.12s)]
*  Satya Nadella, how did he build Microsoft? These are all just like a handful of examples of people that have just [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=735.26s)]
*  tacked on [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=741.3s)]
*  Collectively trillions of dollars of market cap way more than all founders added together in most companies but for one or two [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=742.8199999999999s)]
*  so I think the takeaway is instead of [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=749.9s)]
*  looking for some label I [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=753.1s)]
*  Think you're going to have to do the really hard work if you want a successful business [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=756.1s)]
*  Which is when things are working have the courage to change the few things that still need changing and when things are not working [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=760.5s)]
*  Break it down to the studs and most people don't have the courage to go through the glass eating that is required [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=766.94s)]
*  To get to the other side of that process. Sax, did you read the piece? You've clearly saw all the memes and you know, I [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=776.9s)]
*  Guess kudos for the piece on X this past weekend [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=784.74s)]
*  What are your thoughts on it? Generally speaking anything that you took from it that was notable or is this just some obvious stuff? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=789.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean my reaction to it was that this is hardly new [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=795.66s)]
*  I mean, I remember way back in the PayPal days over 20 years ago [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=799.66s)]
*  We had a rule that we weren't wouldn't hire MBAs [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=803.5s)]
*  We had a no MBA hiring rule and the reason was because we figured out pretty early on that [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=806.54s)]
*  That MBAs were bringing more of a traditional management toolkit that seemed less applicable at a startup [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=811.94s)]
*  subsequent to that obviously Elon has [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=819.82s)]
*  taken a very hands-on approach at his companies that Walter Isaacson described in his book as demon mode and [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=823.22s)]
*  So that's been described Ben Horowitz did a very [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=830.94s)]
*  interesting series of blog posts about management and addressed the topic of micromanagement years ago [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=834.26s)]
*  and [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=841.22s)]
*  So he's written extensively about it and put a lot of substance behind it Ben drew attention to a book [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=841.82s)]
*  By Andy Grove that came out 40 years ago called high output management [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=847.54s)]
*  That also addressed this problem in significant detail and this to boil it down into a nutshell for you the way that Grove [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=852.1s)]
*  defines [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=860.1800000000001s)]
*  this problem as he says that the output of a manager is the output of that person's team and [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=861.78s)]
*  Whether that manager is the CEO or a team lead or a VP or what-have-you the way you [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=869.46s)]
*  Again measure their output is just look at the output of their team. So therefore [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=876.94s)]
*  you ask what's going to maximize the output of that that team or that org and [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=882.02s)]
*  You know, obviously if the CEO tries to do everything and make every decision [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=887.02s)]
*  Probably that's not going to result in the maximum output [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=892.5s)]
*  Conversely if you delegate everything I call it the problem of infinite delegation where [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=895.66s)]
*  CEO delegates to VP VP delegates to director director delegates to manager manager [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=900.06s)]
*  Delegates to the summer intern. Yeah, you know [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=905.5s)]
*  And then all the most important work in the company gets delegated all the way down to the newest most inexperienced people [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=907.98s)]
*  That's not gonna work either. Yeah [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=913.78s)]
*  So again, you're gonna have to find the right balance and again the way that you figure out [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=915.66s)]
*  What the balance is is to apply Grove's principle of maximizing the output of the team or the organization [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=920.9s)]
*  And we've seen in some of the big companies acts that they've cut out middle management [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=927.3000000000001s)]
*  Because so much of the work was just being playing [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=932.22s)]
*  Telephone and handing it to the next person that when you took out that swath of people at Facebook or Google or Microsoft [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=935.46s)]
*  Right the company seemed to work better [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=940.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you're taking out a layer of overpay to take out a huge amount of middle management and it didn't seem to harm the performance [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=942.58s)]
*  Got better and again, you can apply Grove's principle look at what happens to the aggregate output [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=949.46s)]
*  So this topic has been addressed at length and I think has been understood for decades [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=954.4200000000001s)]
*  Maybe the only new thing here is a little bit of branding around founder mode versus [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=961.34s)]
*  manager mode the problem with that branding is I think it's an overly [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=967.4200000000001s)]
*  simplistic and Manichaean view of the world where it kind of fits into [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=972.5s)]
*  Really all of the the PGSA is and the YC [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=978.38s)]
*  Model which is founders always right and everybody else in the ecosystem [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=983.66s)]
*  especially traditional managers there are either liars or fakers and [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=989.3s)]
*  That basically has been the Manichaean model that Paul Grant's been pumping out for decades [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=992.9399999999999s)]
*  There is something wrong with that model. You're you're kind of looking at it and I'm kind of hearing a little bit of a tone there [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=998.5s)]
*  Maybe I'm reading into it that that does it match reality [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1004.0999999999999s)]
*  Well, sure [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1008.26s)]
*  I mean look the whole ecosystem at Silicon Valley exists to help make founders successful [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1008.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean I was a founder myself now. I'm an investor [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1013.8199999999999s)]
*  There's also talent who don't found companies themselves, but want to join them [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1016.7399999999999s)]
*  the whole thing is organized to make founders successful and [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1020.4599999999999s)]
*  The whole idea that people are out to get the founder. I mean, this is a really antiquated idea [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1024.46s)]
*  There was some truth to it in the 1990s [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1028.78s)]
*  By 2002 or 2003 when Peter Thiel created Founders Fund [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1031.6200000000001s)]
*  He called it that to emphasize that you know founders should be in charge [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1036.42s)]
*  I'd say by the mid to late 2000s. No one really disagreed with that anymore [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1040.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so this whole idea that like people are out to get founders rather than make them successful is [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1044.88s)]
*  Antiquated by at least 15 years. I would say why common airs marketing [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1050.46s)]
*  Wouldn't you say is like to kind of put themselves next to the founder and say hey [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1053.74s)]
*  We're the only ones who really care about founders everybody else is out to get them kind of yeah [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1057.34s)]
*  I mean look there was some truth to it, you know, I'd say in the 1990s [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1062.26s)]
*  There was a prevailing view in Silicon Valley 30 years ago that once the company got to a certain level of size you hire a professional [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1066.3s)]
*  Manager subsequent to that people figured out that the best performing companies are indeed the founder led [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1073.1399999999999s)]
*  Companies the ones that keep the founder engaged for a long period of time. They tend to build the most value [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1078.94s)]
*  Everybody understands that everyone wants the founder to be successful [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1084.42s)]
*  The question is how do you make this founder successful? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1087.5800000000002s)]
*  And I think there is a perverse dynamic where if you teach the founder that hey, you're always right and everybody else is a liar [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1089.3400000000001s)]
*  And a faker then that can create a distortion effect where founders don't feel the need to level up [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1096.54s)]
*  We all want the founder to level up [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1103.98s)]
*  I mean I would always rather invest in the founder who has vision over some professional manager, right? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1105.94s)]
*  You want the visionary to succeed but you need them to level up and learn [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1112.42s)]
*  You know just basic management over time and if you're teaching them that hey founders always right [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1116.3s)]
*  There's less incentive to do that. I think it's a wonderful Rorschach test for basic intelligence [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1121.9s)]
*  I mean if you just read something and all of a sudden like that's my problem. It's probably not your problem [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1127.22s)]
*  and [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1134.06s)]
*  So it's a great way to actually weed out the people that were just meant to fail anyways and just needed [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1134.98s)]
*  A way to externalize their frustration and have an excuse [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1141.14s)]
*  I have never seen a person build a successful company unless they understood intimately [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1144.66s)]
*  The core amount of value that their company created and knew how to balance [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1150.9s)]
*  Getting into the weeds with scaling through other people. I've never seen a good example of a great CEO that didn't do that [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1156.46s)]
*  Well, yeah, everyone has to figure this out and there is no word salad that explains this [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1163.12s)]
*  It's incredibly unique to every single company. And so there is no panacea here [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1169.32s)]
*  I mean sometimes the founders job is to get in the weeds of something that's broken in a company for sure and get down [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1174.76s)]
*  I'm not ready other times you want to step back and let the sales team cook because they're crushing it [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1180.36s)]
*  I would say it's their job to have the strategic wherewithal to understand what it takes to win and [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1185.76s)]
*  Then win at all costs. That's their job [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1192.0s)]
*  And if you cannot win and then you externalize your inability to win [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1194.52s)]
*  To an essay or something else [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1200.16s)]
*  You're probably going to fail in your company is probably going to fail free burger [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1202.52s)]
*  You're back in the founder's seat after a brief [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1206.4s)]
*  So drone as an investor any of this ring true to you or obvious. Did you read the essay any thoughts on it? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1209.84s)]
*  the reaction to it I [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1216.92s)]
*  Mentioned this when we had our conversation in 2020 around governance and [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1219.68s)]
*  Why governments seemed to not be able to synthesize different data to make decisions? They were being told what to do [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1225.3600000000001s)]
*  by their [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1232.5600000000002s)]
*  Subordinates the difference for me is [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1234.16s)]
*  leading versus managing [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1237.44s)]
*  that a traditional [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1239.72s)]
*  Manager and I've seen this at a lot of companies. I even saw this a lot at Monsanto [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1242.16s)]
*  the manager [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1246.92s)]
*  Says to the people that report to them [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1249.24s)]
*  What are you guys going to do? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1251.84s)]
*  The people they go down to the people that were work to them and they say what are you guys going to do? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1255.32s)]
*  And so you end up netnet developing this kind of bottoms up model for the organization, which is [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1259.6799999999998s)]
*  effectively driven [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1266.9199999999998s)]
*  With a diffusion of responsibility and as a result the lack of vision [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1270.84s)]
*  The leader says here's what we are going to do and here is how we are going to do it and [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1276.84s)]
*  Then they can allocate responsibility for each of the pieces necessary and the leader [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1282.6799999999998s)]
*  That's most successful is the one that can synthesize the input from the subordinates and take that [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1288.12s)]
*  Synthesis to come up with a decision or a new direction rather than be told what's the answer by the subordinates? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  So leaders, I think fundamentally are able to number one [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1300.84s)]
*  Understand the different points of view of the people that report to them number two set a direction or set a vision [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1304.6s)]
*  Really clearly say this is where we are going and then number three figure out how to allocate responsibility to the people that report to them [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1311.48s)]
*  To achieve that objective whereas a manager is typically being told what's going to happen in the organization like a giant Ouija board [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1317.96s)]
*  with 10,000 employees hands on the writing thing that go around and try and write the sentences and ultimately you just get a bunch of [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1324.8799999999999s)]
*  As companies scale and they bring in these quote professional managers, they're typically kind of looking down and saying hey [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1331.68s)]
*  What are we gonna do? What's gonna happen next and they're not actually setting a direction [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1337.16s)]
*  Whereas someone who's a founder typically feels the authority to be able to set the direction [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1340.52s)]
*  But to Chimath's point Satya Nadella Sundar Nikesh [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1345.3600000000001s)]
*  You can kind of Tim Cook a great example [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1351.0800000000002s)]
*  There are some really great leaders that have run [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1354.68s)]
*  Organizations that are already scaled and then taken them to an order of magnitude or two orders of magnitude [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1357.5s)]
*  Beyond where they were when they step in [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1363.54s)]
*  So I don't think that there's an necessarily a founder and they each did it uniquely [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1365.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't think there's a single way in which any one of those companies is run [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1369.8600000000001s)]
*  That necessarily you could have cut and pasted it to the other companies and have it worked [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1373.74s)]
*  so it requires a [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1377.94s)]
*  smart individual who understands their company and [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1380.3s)]
*  Their human capital intimately well and their business model by the way [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1384.22s)]
*  What's important about what you just said to mouth is that that is effectively? I think the definition of [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1387.86s)]
*  Like being a successful founder understanding from first principles [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1394.62s)]
*  So these are leaders that can think from first principles not necessarily from comparables most managers are caught in business school [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1397.9399999999998s)]
*  Here's how a business is run. Here's how this person did it [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1404.82s)]
*  Here's how this company did it and then they go and they try and cookie-cutter repeat that [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1407.52s)]
*  That doesn't really work because every business if it's going to be successful it has to be unique and so the ability to actually think [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1411.0600000000002s)]
*  Uniquely and identify from first principles the means necessary to achieve the mission of the organization [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1417.9s)]
*  I think is a critical critical leadership trait [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1423.0600000000002s)]
*  Maybe that yeah that leader can come from a founder or not [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1426.8600000000001s)]
*  But this ability to kind of yeah ignore convention ignore comparables and think for yourself [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1430.14s)]
*  I don't see most founders starting the business because they've done some first principles analysis [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1435.18s)]
*  I see most founders starting companies because they see a [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1441.66s)]
*  Gap that they're pretty sure exists, but I think the biggest thing that founders have is [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1445.3400000000001s)]
*  this intersection of fearlessness and naivety and [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1452.26s)]
*  So they if they knew too much they would never do it [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1456.22s)]
*  That I don't think necessarily means that the entire set of all of those people are actually great first principles thinkers [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1459.6s)]
*  The first principles is required after product market fit what's required before product market fit is risk-taking [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1466.08s)]
*  curiosity [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1473.6s)]
*  relentless iteration and those are a very different set of [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1474.8s)]
*  Characteristics is it true that sub founders can then change their toolkit? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1478.92s)]
*  Absolutely, but is it true that quote-unquote because you have a title you have those things [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1483.0s)]
*  Absolutely not otherwise we would have a much higher success rate in Silicon Valley than we do there is a reason why [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1487.4399999999998s)]
*  95% of these companies go to zero [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1494.28s)]
*  It's because the ability to do the first thing is rare and then the ability to transition is even more [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1495.9199999999998s)]
*  Well building a unique business and I think if you look at Airbnb [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1502.28s)]
*  And I'll give Brian Chesky incredible credit for this you look at uber [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1505.6799999999998s)]
*  You look at how Steve Jobs built Apple what every one of these businesses have in common is that they were all built in a unique [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1510.48s)]
*  Way, and I think that's what makes great businesses [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1516.44s)]
*  Is that they identify their own path their own unique path for how to operate a business to scale to achieve the mission of the [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1519.4s)]
*  Organization and I think that that's what's typically lacking in trained managers who use [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1526.16s)]
*  Comparables and biases from their prior experience and what they've been trained and taught to use as a cookie cutter type model [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1531.0800000000002s)]
*  Which doesn't create unique value it makes your business look like the other and ultimately it? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1536.8600000000001s)]
*  Commoditizes some aspect of the business to the point that the value of the business goes down [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1541.48s)]
*  But to build something unique where you're constantly finding the unique path that gives you an advantage is what all of these companies have in [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1545.6399999999999s)]
*  Common whether that unique path was made by an experienced hired person or a first-time founder [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1551.92s)]
*  It's this ability to kind of build a unique competency that I think makes them all distinct as a group [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1557.8799999999999s)]
*  I think that's a really good point like if you look at some technology businesses [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1563.04s)]
*  they start off looking like technology businesses and what they really are are [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1566.72s)]
*  tech enabled consumer businesses [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1570.8000000000002s)]
*  other businesses are pure technology companies and [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1573.4s)]
*  Why that distinction is important in this context is that there are certain kinds of challenges you have in the former? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1576.2s)]
*  That you just don't have in the latter and vice versa so if you're a Google or a Facebook and you run into some problem [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1582.2s)]
*  Typically the solution is you can engineer around it because ultimately your product is free [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1589.16s)]
*  And there's a different way to scale and grow and create feature value because those are also incrementally free [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1593.76s)]
*  If you look at a company like Airbnb, and if you look at the last six months in the stock [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1599.68s)]
*  What is it telling you it's telling you that the people that own it have realized that it's less of a technology business [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1605.0800000000002s)]
*  And it's more of a cyclical [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1610.3600000000001s)]
*  Business that ebbs and flows with the ability to spend money on behalf of the consumer [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1614.3200000000002s)]
*  So now all of a sudden you're put into a different bucket and you grow as people's belief ebbs and flows [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1619.4s)]
*  About the amount of spending that consumers have that is independent of your product quality [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1626.12s)]
*  And what that means is that there's no amount of investment in technology that you can really make to change that [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1631.44s)]
*  People need to have [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1638.0s)]
*  Excess capital in order to spend on vacations, and then you can capture your fair share of that [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1639.76s)]
*  But if we're in a recession that company will be under pressure in a way that has nothing to do with the internal product quality [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1644.6399999999999s)]
*  That they exhibit so these are just [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1650.8s)]
*  Dimensionality there's just different kinds of problems that every single company faces that are totally unique to its own circumstances [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1653.5200000000002s)]
*  so if you are trying to point to some label as [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1660.64s)]
*  The reason why your company is failing I would just encourage you to not do that [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1665.24s)]
*  Jake how you've even you've interviewed thousands of founders CEOs you've seen successful unsuccessful [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1669.7600000000002s)]
*  Do you have a point of view on whether this concept applies and what if you have a general kind of? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1675.44s)]
*  Heuristic for the difference between success and not success [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1681.68s)]
*  It's very different in the the place where Paul Graham and I invest year zero year one of a company and [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1685.28s)]
*  Chamath you alluded to this in that time period going from zero to one from no customers to one customer [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1692.3999999999999s)]
*  It's about you know [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1699.0s)]
*  Really having a team of builders people who can actually build a product and have what's called product velocity in the industry the ability to iterate [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1699.96s)]
*  And then how much time do they spend with customers understanding what those customers problems are and so what we'll see is when the professional managers [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1706.3999999999999s)]
*  Try to do that [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1714.04s)]
*  they try to get a product to market and achieve what's called product market fit and then eventually maybe get product or [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1715.24s)]
*  Get market pull as Andy Ratcliffe defines it [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1721.8799999999999s)]
*  Which is the market is seeking your product out because of word of mouth and because they need it which Airbnb and uber would fall into now [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1725.0s)]
*  The difference between those two moments in time and who's good at it is it's pretty different to your point Chamath [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1732.7s)]
*  So to be able to win both those bets is hard. That's like a parlay in a way [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1737.78s)]
*  Getting the product market fit requires this sort of relentlessness in [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1742.94s)]
*  Innovation and trying things if you have experience in that vertical it works against you [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1748.62s)]
*  So we were looking at a company today in our in our firm [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1753.54s)]
*  That has a really good idea and it's people who are from the industry [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1757.62s)]
*  But they have an okay. It's people from the industry [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1761.54s)]
*  But they can't get the product built because they're senior managers who have 20 years experience in this particular vertical [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1763.82s)]
*  You would much rather see neophytes come out the vertical [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1770.18s)]
*  So if you look at the companies mentioned here Airbnb uber and then SpaceX and [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1772.96s)]
*  Tesla you just look at those four companies [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1779.3s)]
*  They had no experience zero in space in travel in [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1781.5s)]
*  transportation [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1788.1s)]
*  totality, you know or any of the [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1789.86s)]
*  The success they had or electric cars [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1792.1399999999999s)]
*  But to actually scale those companies that does require a lot of expertise a lot of tactics and you know people who can focus [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1794.6999999999998s)]
*  In a way on very narrow things and that sometimes founders who are in that first group they can't [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1803.02s)]
*  Have that focus on but one tiny little thing [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1810.4199999999998s)]
*  They just get bored with it [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1813.58s)]
*  And so they have to learn to have really great people recruit really great people [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1814.8s)]
*  Actually, yes delegate to them to run a department and say hey [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1819.86s)]
*  We the goal of this organization and you saw this Chamath when you were at Facebook [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1823.34s)]
*  I think you've told me so many stories about you know, you're focused on one thing the signup flow [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1827.78s)]
*  Getting people to add that second or third friend getting them to fill out their profile. There were like key moments you determined [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1833.8999999999999s)]
*  Would equal success and then Zuckerberg yourself and those that early crew were able to obsess over those. So maybe you could talk about [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1840.9799999999998s)]
*  Zuckerberg's right to getting the first, you know, whatever 10 million people in the product, but then 10 million to a billion [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1849.18s)]
*  Well, I mean Zuck I think did an incredible thing for me, which is he let my team cook. I [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1856.18s)]
*  Don't remember having skip-level meetings this that none of this other nonsense [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1861.6200000000001s)]
*  But at the same time what he did was he created air cover for us because let's be honest [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1866.1000000000001s)]
*  I was an immature executive at the time. So I was still learning how to [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1870.5800000000002s)]
*  be [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1874.7s)]
*  Part of a fabric of a group of people I did not know how to do that [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1875.94s)]
*  So I was a little bit of a lone wolf operator with my team and I operated that way, you know [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1879.1000000000001s)]
*  I would hey guys we get to 100 million people [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1883.94s)]
*  we're all going to Vegas and the rest of the company would be upset and [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1886.14s)]
*  You know mark and Cheryl's job would be to clean up the broken glass of everybody else saying [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1889.46s)]
*  There's these haves and have-nots at Facebook and in hindsight who cares because it all worked in the moment [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1893.94s)]
*  I could see why everybody else was a little bit upset with that [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1899.94s)]
*  So they did a wonderful job of letting this wonderful team of very curious iterators [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1902.38s)]
*  Do their job and they basically got out of the way and I think that that's a wonderful thing [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1907.74s)]
*  but is that repeatable not in any other company because that context and [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1913.02s)]
*  timing and moment was very unique and again my [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1917.8600000000001s)]
*  Approach to the job was unique not necessarily sustainable not necessarily good or nor bad [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1921.66s)]
*  Different and we adapted to those boundary conditions to maximize how we could deliver [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1927.28s)]
*  But it doesn't mean anything to any other company in my opinion [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1932.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's it's well said there's another good book before we go on to our next subject Patrick Lanzione [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1936.56s)]
*  I'm sure some of you have read the five dysfunctions of a team [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1943.16s)]
*  but he kind of got into early this sort of ability to be unliked inside of a company and [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1946.44s)]
*  I'll just I think I highly recommend the book because it really talks about this sort of fear of conflict and [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1953.8799999999999s)]
*  Avoidance of accountability and inattention to results which is kind of the underpinnings of I think what Paul was getting to with [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1959.88s)]
*  founder mode [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1967.88s)]
*  Okay, great discussion everybody. Let's [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1969.48s)]
*  Speaking of founder mode. I mean this story keeps coming back [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1972.64s)]
*  Ryan Breslow is back in the news. We talked about this company before Breslow is a founder of a company called bolt [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1977.5600000000002s)]
*  That's a payment startup and I have to set the story up in a couple of acts here [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1983.8000000000002s)]
*  Saxon I had been following it for a while [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1988.8s)]
*  Bolt was a payment startup. They did one-click checkout products if you don't know the one click [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1991.92s)]
*  Amazon had a patent for this for a while. It came out of [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=1998.16s)]
*  It came out of patent protection. Everybody sort of jumped on it. They're shop pay by Shopify [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2001.92s)]
*  You probably have experience you you buy something at one store and then you log into another store with your phone number [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2006.6399999999999s)]
*  It has all your credentials [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2013.4s)]
*  And that basically takes out the friction and it allows you to make a purchase at another vendor without having to put in all your [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2014.8400000000001s)]
*  credentials and credit card and everything [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2022.1200000000001s)]
*  So bolt makes that through an API for [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2024.2s)]
*  different [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2028.3600000000001s)]
*  Shops online they generate 27 million in revenue on a 300 million dollar loss last year [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2029.8s)]
*  They get two to three percent commission when they sell something [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2036.18s)]
*  Anyway, we talked about bolt back in January 2022 because they had raised at an extraordinary valuation [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2039.2s)]
*  355 million and an 11 billion dollar valuation [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2045.36s)]
*  366 times revenue sacks, I guess we missed those [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2049.84s)]
*  Then Breslow made waves on Twitter by calling Shrype and YC the mob bosses of Silicon Valley [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2053.92s)]
*  He alleged they were kind of acting in cahoots to keep people from using bolts [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2060.24s)]
*  And he claimed YC was skewering rankings on Hacker News all this other stuff anyway [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2067.2400000000002s)]
*  It's been two and a half years [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2072.84s)]
*  Since we talked about this craziness at fault and Breslow stepped down as CEO after posting that thread [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2074.64s)]
*  He was accused of overstating bolts customers and technical [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2080.48s)]
*  Capabilities to investors while raising money that got probed by the SEC. They didn't take any action [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2084.12s)]
*  And then their valuation was slashed 97% to 300 million earlier this year [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2090.24s)]
*  That's where the story had ended until just last week when an insane story came out that bolts interim CEO [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2095.44s)]
*  Not Breslow had emailed investors informing them out of the blue that they were going to raise [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2102.16s)]
*  450 million at a 14 billion dollar valuation [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2109.2s)]
*  This came as a surprise to investors [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2113.52s)]
*  They didn't know this was happening according to reports and that this deal would put Breslow back in charge as CEO [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2115.9199999999996s)]
*  It was confusing to all the investors and they've all started to lawyer up and try to figure this out [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2121.96s)]
*  Here's what we know so far bolt is on pace to generate 28 million in revenue this year roughly the same as 2021 and [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2127.2799999999997s)]
*  So a 14 billion dollar valuation would be 500 times [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2134.16s)]
*  Revenue Chamath. I'm not sure who would pay for that deal [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2139.8399999999997s)]
*  But this deal is unique in that it's called pay-to-play if you don't know that term [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2143.68s)]
*  It basically means if you're an existing investor if you don't invest in this round [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2148.3599999999997s)]
*  You are going to lose your existing shares or have them diluted massively. So [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2152.9199999999996s)]
*  some [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2158.68s)]
*  investment bank out of the Seychelles [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2159.8399999999997s)]
*  Which is that tiny island in Africa that rich people go on vacation was supposed to put in 200 millions [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2162.56s)]
*  That firm was called silver bear the other [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2167.64s)]
*  250 million would come from a firm called the London farm in marketing capital and [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2170.92s)]
*  credits on a venture investing platform [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2176.0s)]
*  So anyway, there's a ton of carve outs here and other stuff. I'm gonna stop there at the notes and just sax [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2178.64s)]
*  This is the craziest story. Sorry took so long to get here [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2185.72s)]
*  What what are your thoughts on what we're seeing here in this drama and this Zerb valuation? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2188.6s)]
*  Yeah, look [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2194.96s)]
*  Ryan has been right before he's been right in the past [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2196.36s)]
*  But in this case, it looks like he's clearly over his skis and if the reporting is correct [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2199.1600000000003s)]
*  It looks like he's trying to drum up interest in a financing round by [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2205.04s)]
*  Representing things that aren't true or haven't happened yet saying that certain investors are important and those investors are coming out and saying that they're not [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2209.6400000000003s)]
*  The question I think that's relevant and that relates back to our previous topic. Is this founder mode? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2217.36s)]
*  I mean what makes this not founder mode and [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2224.54s)]
*  I think that this is where it'd be helpful to have a little bit more substance and not just [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2227.7799999999997s)]
*  Branding exercise. Let me give you a more mundane example [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2232.94s)]
*  I was in a board meeting the other day and I commented the team on how they had gotten their burn down substantially since last [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2236.14s)]
*  Word meeting and somebody joked one of the founders said founder mode and was kind of a joke. Okay, great [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2242.7s)]
*  But then it got me thinking [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2247.7799999999997s)]
*  What if in this board meeting it had gone the opposite way and the founders had taken the position [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2249.38s)]
*  you know what we're not gonna try and cut burn we're gonna put the pedal to the metal and [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2254.5s)]
*  Accelerate the business and spend a lot more because somehow it's gonna get us to the next funding round faster [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2259.58s)]
*  I [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2264.54s)]
*  So when you start branding these concepts without [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2274.86s)]
*  Putting any substance behind them and quite frankly, you've never been an operator yourself [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2278.6200000000003s)]
*  You've never actually created a unicorn company [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2282.94s)]
*  But you're representing yourself as a unicorn whisper like you're a guru and something you've never really done before [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2285.38s)]
*  Then it just allows people who want to justify bad behavior to basically get away with doing whatever they want [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2291.5s)]
*  And that's what you're seeing with founder mode now Jake how the reason why that joke is funny [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2298.34s)]
*  You're doing your Tony Montana bit. Yes, because you can justify any bad behavior as founder mode [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2302.54s)]
*  Yes [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2307.6600000000003s)]
*  And I think that's what all the memes are about right now is that founder modes become a joke [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2307.98s)]
*  Because there's no substance to it and allows you to justify anything a founder wants to do [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2313.94s)]
*  And I think a more honest way to approach this would be to define here are the actual [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2318.54s)]
*  Behaviors that make a founder successful [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2325.18s)]
*  Including when a founder is wrong. How about slightly differently? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2328.46s)]
*  There are stupid outcomes and smart outcomes and there are all kinds of different people that can get to stupid outcomes and smart outcomes [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2332.1s)]
*  And so you have to have the courage to say that was stupid [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2339.62s)]
*  Don't ever do that again and that was smart do more of that [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2342.18s)]
*  And if you can't distinguish the two or you can't get to the latter you're gonna fail instead of founder mode [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2344.9s)]
*  Why don't we call a founder responsibility? Like what are the responsibilities? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2350.34s)]
*  I mean founder authority founder responsibility Steph Curry is not the founder of the Warriors, but he's the linchpin [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2354.5s)]
*  Okay, my point is teams teams need winning players [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2359.86s)]
*  And then you need to put together your own game plan for winning [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2363.6200000000003s)]
*  But the goal should be winning if you are not winning you are a loser and what is winning have really talented really driven people [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2367.7400000000002s)]
*  In different positions who understand their position are held accountable [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2374.86s)]
*  For getting positions winning winning if you're not winning you're losing. Yeah to be frank [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2379.54s)]
*  There's a certain kind of con man who represents [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2385.5s)]
*  themselves as a guru even though they've never done the thing that they pretend to have done and [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2388.6200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and in this case frankly, you've got someone promoting concepts about [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2394.58s)]
*  About operating [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2398.96s)]
*  When they've never done that before they're never scaled a unicorn company yet [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2400.8799999999997s)]
*  They're pretending to be a unicorn whisper who's telling founders how to behave and the question you to ask is this at the end of [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2404.3399999999997s)]
*  The day helpful or not. I mean we all want to exalt and celebrate founders. I want to I want to win [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2410.6s)]
*  Exactly, but we all want to win and you know James Madison said that you know men are not not angels [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2416.68s)]
*  What do you do about those cases rare? I think they're pretty rare where the founders just wrong about something [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2421.8399999999997s)]
*  they're like representing that investors are gonna do something that they're not gonna do or [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2428.28s)]
*  Elizabeth Holmes represents that she's got a product that she doesn't have or you have a founder breaking a regulatory requirement that actually is [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2433.0s)]
*  Necessary that they comply with what do you do in all those cases? You actually need to have some objective standard of behavior [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2440.76s)]
*  That's not just Oh founders always right [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2448.1400000000003s)]
*  Traditional managers are always wrong because that's just not nuanced enough to account for [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2451.6000000000004s)]
*  What it's actually gonna take to win [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2457.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean if Adam Newman had listened to a lot of the smart people he had hired at WeWork [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2458.8399999999997s)]
*  He might not have signed leases that were so high priced and gotten away from the playbook that worked when they started that business [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2464.3599999999997s)]
*  Which was find the cheapest real estate charge the highest price you can for it by making it [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2471.52s)]
*  You know a community and really nice [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2475.9199999999996s)]
*  As opposed to hiring the class a getting the class a space and then charging a B price [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2478.8799999999997s)]
*  To your point like a senior real estate executive would have put together a forecast of cash flows [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2484.54s)]
*  Yeah, and it would have been a very boring meeting [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2489.9s)]
*  but if you didn't have the intellectual wherewithal to realize that that was a critical meeting for a real estate business and [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2492.7400000000002s)]
*  Then listen to that and then manage your burn appropriately. That was a huge mistake [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2498.82s)]
*  So again, it just it always comes down to [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2504.3s)]
*  Can you take all the labels and all of the you know? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2507.1400000000003s)]
*  Naval gazing aside and can you make good smart decisions when? [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2511.74s)]
*  You're asked to run the play. That's your job at every level of a company and a CEO that knows how to do that [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2516.38s)]
*  Tends to helm winning companies and I don't think that that is exhibited in whether you were employee zero or employee [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2524.18s)]
*  20 it's it's a intellectual and psychological archetype [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2531.34s)]
*  Yeah [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2535.7s)]
*  I mean in my experience the founders that are highly successful or the ones that are hands-on [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2536.2s)]
*  they've got a strong vision and they pursue it and they're constantly learning and [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2541.54s)]
*  Leveling up and they're gonna learn wherever they can they are gonna learn from other founders [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2545.98s)]
*  They're gonna learn from executives. They may have hired who maybe do have more traditional background [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2550.94s)]
*  they're gonna figure out what works for them and they're gonna discard the parts that don't work for them and they're gonna [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2555.48s)]
*  Double down the parts that do and the end result is gonna be a style that works for them [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2560.42s)]
*  And there's not a one-size-fits-all to that as we've seen [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2564.66s)]
*  That's actually the most important thing that that I've heard in this whole discussion that we don't talk enough about the people that win [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2567.7s)]
*  Are? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2573.5s)]
*  deeply intellectually promiscuous [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2574.8599999999997s)]
*  They're learning about many many things. They're adapting things to their own playbook [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2577.06s)]
*  The next day they may throw that piece away and take something else because this is something they learned [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2582.18s)]
*  We use the word re underwrite a lot, right? But it's this idea of constantly re underwriting [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2586.7799999999997s)]
*  What the conditions on the field are so, you know what you need to do in that moment to maximize your chances of success [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2592.3599999999997s)]
*  Perfect example of this when I was running web logs, Inc [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2597.98s)]
*  We were gonna raise around to funding mark Cuban had given us the first 300 and mark and resin [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2600.74s)]
*  Was gonna give us 500 K for our blogging company that didn't gadget etc. And I had met Jeff Bezos and I [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2606.22s)]
*  Told him I'm in Seattle this week [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2613.98s)]
*  Would love to catch up with you. I wasn't in sea [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2616.6s)]
*  I said I was gonna be in Seattle next week for the whole week. We'd love to catch up with you [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2618.8199999999997s)]
*  I wasn't planning on being in Seattle. I made that story up just to make it convenient for him and [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2621.8199999999997s)]
*  He said sure come by on Tuesday or whatever I come by Tuesday sit with Jeff Bezos my partner Brian Alvi and [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2626.9s)]
*  the intellectual curiosity he took on [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2632.7400000000002s)]
*  Taking apart in gadget and blogging as this new medium that was very disruptive at the time [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2636.1400000000003s)]
*  How do you pick the name of the blog? Tell me about the CMS? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2640.5800000000004s)]
*  What is the publishing strategy? How do you hire people and I would say oh, you know [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2644.0200000000004s)]
*  We hire people the best people are the great commentators [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2648.0400000000004s)]
*  So we look at the great comments and then we hire them and then I watched in Amazon [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2650.3s)]
*  They started hiring the people writing great reviews for their review team and I was like, oh wow [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2655.2999999999997s)]
*  He really is taking notes on this into your points acts or maybe try if you made this point [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2659.72s)]
*  In terms of hiring one of the great techniques Bezos had is a concept called bar razors and a bar raiser in [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2665.46s)]
*  Amazon is somebody you hire for your team who is so good that they raised the bar for the entire team [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2673.22s)]
*  So when they would say hey, we're gonna add somebody to this team [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2680.02s)]
*  They're gonna be the tenth person you'd say are they better at whatever dimensions than the rest of the team and will they? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2682.72s)]
*  Raise the bar for everybody here [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2688.6s)]
*  And then you think about some managers they hire somebody who fits in [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2690.6s)]
*  They hire somebody who doesn't rock the boat and there are techniques here in very specific ways to attract talent to your startup [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2693.7599999999998s)]
*  That will become you know [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2701.12s)]
*  Do you guys remember part of the reason why YC and Founders Fund and Andreessen took this path was to try to? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2702.72s)]
*  Corner Sequoia because Sequoia had this reputation in the 90s and early 2000s as [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2710.2799999999997s)]
*  Somebody that would boot the founder [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2716.7599999999998s)]
*  But when you look at Sequoia's returns, what their returns say is these guys are just winners. They're consummate [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2720.16s)]
*  Incredible winners. And so what Sequoia had the ability to do clearly looking backwards is figure out which companies had people that [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2726.64s)]
*  Were adapting themselves and scaling and people who were a little bit in a cul-de-sac and just needed to get replaced and [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2734.32s)]
*  again, they were [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2741.44s)]
*  operating from a first principles perspective in my opinion and they were being [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2743.08s)]
*  Pretty ruthless and acting with zero nostalgia [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2748.04s)]
*  So it's again, it's just a reminder like there is no easy answer here it is so hard [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2752.6s)]
*  That is why 95 plus percent of our companies in our efforts [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2757.7599999999998s)]
*  End up with nothing to show it was the end of it to bring you around this discussion there was a [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2762.7400000000002s)]
*  moment in time actually where this actually crossed over and you got to witness it which was [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2768.58s)]
*  When Larry and Sergey were taking Google public and before that they said, you know [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2773.58s)]
*  I don't know if the markets will let these two [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2777.82s)]
*  PhDs as smart as they are as driven as they are with such a great product [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2780.78s)]
*  I don't know if they're gonna buy the stock [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2784.34s)]
*  Can we get an adult in the room who's done this before and they found Eric Schmidt who had run Novell and [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2786.06s)]
*  They brought him in as this, you know [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2790.7400000000002s)]
*  Third part of the triangle and then eventually he wound up leaving etc. What were your thoughts on? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2794.26s)]
*  Silicon Valley in that transition time and Eric Schmidt's role at Google. Well, Eric Schmidt came into Google through his relationship [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2800.54s)]
*  With John Doar and John Doar as a mentor to Larry and Sergey an investor in Google [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2807.7400000000002s)]
*  Had suggested that they bring in a professional manager that can help them successfully scale the business [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2813.26s)]
*  And John had this relationship with Eric and Larry and Sergey started to socialize with Eric and it was a very long [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2820.38s)]
*  Process and they ultimately respected Eric because of his technical capabilities and technical background [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2827.1s)]
*  Which was quite distinct from the other candidates that they had met during this process [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2832.7400000000002s)]
*  But it was necessary. They were first time they'd never worked anywhere. They never had a job. They had never had experience [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2836.98s)]
*  I think similarly Sheryl Sandberg as a partner to Zuck [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2843.28s)]
*  Ultimately helped him level up and obviously Chamath and others prior to that [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2847.5s)]
*  but these first-time founders that haven't had any sort of work experience and have [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2852.26s)]
*  No concept of kind of organizational dynamics and the challenges that will arise as you try and build and scale a team to execute a mission [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2856.5s)]
*  Typically need to have some degree of counseling mentorship and support and so bringing in that degree of experience with someone who's ready and willing to partner with [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2863.58s)]
*  the founders [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2871.82s)]
*  Meaning not necessarily direct them but partner with them and help them learn as [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2872.94s)]
*  Eric did and then ultimately handed the reins back to Larry and [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2878.1s)]
*  As Cheryl did and ultimately Zuck continued to kind of lead the company [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2882.78s)]
*  Have been really powerful enabling forces, but Chamath is right the early days of Silicon Valley venture capital [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2886.98s)]
*  We're really framed around this concept where you find some smart technical founding team and then you bring in a professional manager [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2892.7000000000003s)]
*  But that's because so much of the origin of technology in Silicon Valley was about selling technology into an enterprise [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2898.7799999999997s)]
*  So there was kind of a bit of a tried-and-true business model and business [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2904.9199999999996s)]
*  Structure that made sense [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2909.3399999999997s)]
*  The new era since the internet has been quite different every business model imaginable has been reinvented in Silicon Valley [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2911.8199999999997s)]
*  And so success I think has largely arisen in reinventing businesses reinventing industries [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2918.3799999999997s)]
*  by kind of novel independent thinking leaders not necessarily [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2923.7799999999997s)]
*  Bringing in experienced managers to scale up a known business model [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2929.06s)]
*  Right and just I think the turning point was when Peter started founders fund, but that was over 20 years ago [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2932.58s)]
*  in other words [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2939.4599999999996s)]
*  Peter realized that that old approach in the 90s of bringing in the professional management had run its course and [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2940.5s)]
*  That we needed to help founders level up and stay in the seat for as long as possible [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2947.4599999999996s)]
*  That was 22 years ago that he created that firm [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2952.74s)]
*  Yeah, so we're like decades into this and that's what kind of feels anachronistic about this whole discussion is it's almost like we're pretending [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2955.86s)]
*  Like we're still in a world in which founders aren't celebrated and exalted. It's quite the contrary. They can do almost anything and [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2963.9s)]
*  the the question is how do you help them level up and [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2971.9s)]
*  At some point if you're constantly just saying that well founders know everything founders always right [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2976.1800000000003s)]
*  Is that actually helping them or is it actually reinforcing a mentality that oh [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2981.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't have to learn anything because that all the great founders have been [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2986.2599999999998s)]
*  Learning machines, but if they had been told throughout that you're always right. Don't worry about it [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2990.58s)]
*  Then they may not have learned the same way. Did you say you met with Eric Schmidt recently Shema? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=2995.66s)]
*  Well, I had a meeting with Eric Schmidt a few weeks ago [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3000.7s)]
*  Which blew my mind and I think I called Fieberg right afterwards [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3004.1s)]
*  This is just an example of like there are just people that know how to win [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3008.02s)]
*  He is one of those people so as part of 8090 one of the things that we're doing is we're building a transpiler [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3012.2999999999997s)]
*  you know right now everybody is very much fixated on pytorch and [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3018.66s)]
*  The problem with pytorch and building to Nvidia is you have this thing called CUDA in the middle of it [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3024.66s)]
*  Which is owned by Nvidia and I think that over time that's problematic. So [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3029.36s)]
*  The long-term solution is you need a functional transpiler that can take CUDA littered code [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3033.42s)]
*  But be able to compile it without losing performance to any hardware. So Amazon hardware Google TPU, etc [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3038.1000000000004s)]
*  So Eric and I sat down we were together for a couple days [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3044.5800000000004s)]
*  When we were in Europe and we had a like a hour 90 minute meeting [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3047.82s)]
*  the level of technical detail and mastery that he had blew me away and [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3052.34s)]
*  He asked [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3058.6600000000003s)]
*  Hundreds of very very very specific questions some of which I knew the answers to some of which I didn't I was able to ask [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3060.66s)]
*  him what he thought he was able to go into the weeds in an enormous amount of detail and what I thought was [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3067.1s)]
*  Where is he finding the time? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3074.14s)]
*  to know as much as he does about compilers and [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3077.66s)]
*  the specifics of AI at this level of detail and and the story of telling you this example is [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3081.98s)]
*  Just more that that is a kind of person that is just rare and unique [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3088.7400000000002s)]
*  you can't put a label on that person and [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3093.06s)]
*  You just want that person near you because he has the ability to help you in a way that most other people just do not [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3095.62s)]
*  Irrespective of whatever their title is [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3103.14s)]
*  so it just goes to say like you got to focus on the actual meat of the problem and [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3104.88s)]
*  In that specific case he gave us two [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3111.1s)]
*  Technical directions that my team and I are exploring now with this goal that if one of them pans out [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3113.94s)]
*  I'll go back to Eric and say look we tried these things. This is working. This is not working [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3119.26s)]
*  What do you think and it was an incredibly helpful meeting to me and he just offered that time to me [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3123.82s)]
*  and so I my point is [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3129.06s)]
*  People like this exist and I think that the whole goal if you're trying to win [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3130.86s)]
*  Seek those people out independent of what they're doing what they're trying on your team [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3135.54s)]
*  learn from them as much as you can and [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3139.54s)]
*  Hopefully you get one step closer to winning and get them on your team if possible. Yeah [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3142.1s)]
*  Ideally, all right. Here we go [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3146.46s)]
*  A panel of California judges has ruled that section 230 does not protect to talk algorithm in the case of the death [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3148.3s)]
*  tragically of a ten-year-old girl we've talked about section 230 and [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3156.38s)]
*  legislation to protect algorithms or to make algorithms [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3160.9s)]
*  More editorial we'll get to that in a second [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3164.62s)]
*  But let me just cue up the story and then we'll play a clip from episode 99 of all in podcasts [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3166.82s)]
*  in late 2021 a ten-year-old Pennsylvania girl accidentally killed herself while participating in a [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3171.54s)]
*  Blackout challenge she saw on tik-tok. That is a challenge that encourages viewers to choke themselves with objects like belts until they pass out [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3178.06s)]
*  According to Bloomberg this challenge has been linked with the deaths of 15 young people. Oh my god. Yeah, it's terrible [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3186.2599999999998s)]
*  That's the child's mother sued tik-tok arguing that their algorithm served blackout challenge videos to her child thus making them responsible [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3192.5s)]
*  In the past algorithmic decisions as we've talked about here were protected under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3200.82s)]
*  Just break this down very simply if you're section 230 that grants internet platforms featuring user generated content [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3208.5800000000004s)]
*  Immunity from being sued over content published by those users on their platform [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3215.5800000000004s)]
*  So YouTube tick-tock Twitter, you know a blogging platform, etc [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3219.94s)]
*  so [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3225.1400000000003s)]
*  Because of 230 you're technically not supposed to be able able to go after something like tick-tock because a random user posted [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3226.42s)]
*  crazy videos like this [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3233.34s)]
*  But an appeals court from off has reversed that ruling with the judge arguing that ticktox algorithm represents a unique [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3234.66s)]
*  Quote-unquote expressive product which communicates to users through a curated stream of videos the judge claims ticktox algorithms reflect [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3242.1800000000003s)]
*  reflect editorial judgment, so [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3250.46s)]
*  Here's the interesting legal detail the new ruling specifically cites the Supreme Court's [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3253.2599999999998s)]
*  recent decision Moody versus net choice in which the court ruled unanimously to vacate that [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3257.7s)]
*  Florida law we talked about here that banned tech companies from deplatforming political officials [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3263.34s)]
*  so that was viewed as a big win for speech protection sacks and [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3268.86s)]
*  moderation rights in big tech [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3273.54s)]
*  But this is all super ironic because the same ruling that affirmed big techs First Amendment protections in content moderation [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3274.98s)]
*  May also have nullified the section 230 immunity. So [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3281.5s)]
*  Let's play this quick clip here Chamath. This is a discussion you and I had about should algorithms [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3286.02s)]
*  Be part of section 230 back in 2022. Let me break down an algorithm for you [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3292.22s)]
*  Okay, effectively. It is a mathematical equation of variables and weights an editor [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3297.18s)]
*  50 years ago was somebody who had that equation of [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3303.18s)]
*  Variables and weights in his or her mind and so all we did was we translated [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3308.1s)]
*  Again, this multimodal model that was in somebody's brain into a model that's mathematical that sits in code [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3313.06s)]
*  You're talking about the front page and I think New York Times [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3320.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3323.38s)]
*  And I think it's a fig leaf to say that because there is not an individual person who writes point two [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3323.88s)]
*  In front of this one variable and point eight in front of the other [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3329.2999999999997s)]
*  That all of a sudden that this isn't editorial decision-making is wrong [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3333.16s)]
*  We need to understand the current moment in which we live which is that these computers are thinking actively [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3336.68s)]
*  For us and that is just true [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3345.0s)]
*  And so I think we need to acknowledge that because I think it allows us at least to be in a position [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3347.48s)]
*  To rewrite these laws through the lens of the 21st century [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3352.7599999999998s)]
*  There's such an easy way to do this if you're tick-tock if you're YouTube [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3356.36s)]
*  If you want section 230 if you want to have common carrier and not be responsible with there when a user signs up [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3360.08s)]
*  It should give them the option would you like to turn on an algorithm? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3366.56s)]
*  Here are a series of algorithms which you could turn on you could bring your own algorithm [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3370.1200000000003s)]
*  You could write your own algorithm with a bunch of sliders or here are ones that other users and services provide like an app store [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3374.42s)]
*  So sure ma that was your take on it. And here we are. What are your thoughts on? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3381.32s)]
*  Section 230 and algorithms today should if you use an algorithm should that [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3387.2s)]
*  Nullify void your section 230 protection. I think it is a fig leaf to say that we've there's a level of abstraction [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3393.8799999999997s)]
*  That should give us immunity. I think that these algorithms are taught to [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3400.3199999999997s)]
*  iteratively become better and better at hooking people on [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3405.7799999999997s)]
*  whatever is trending in that moment and [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3409.56s)]
*  I think it's probably known to these companies at any given time what's trending [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3412.6s)]
*  So even though they're not literally going and changing something in the moment [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3417.8s)]
*  Does it mean that they don't support it and doesn't mean that they're not aware of it and it doesn't mean that they haven't created [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3422.92s)]
*  a [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3429.52s)]
*  Net to sort of catch these [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3430.64s)]
*  lightnings in a bottle and spread them around and so I think we just need to have a more [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3433.56s)]
*  intelligent discussion [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3439.92s)]
*  about how responsibility should be shared in a world where [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3442.36s)]
*  Section 230. Yeah, you're right. I'll just say it again. We're not writing deterministic code anymore [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3447.88s)]
*  it doesn't say if this then that show them the [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3451.96s)]
*  Blackout video there is no piece of code anywhere [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3455.28s)]
*  But it's it's kind of a fig leaf to say that that isn't the intention of the way that the new form of software is written [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3458.04s)]
*  Yes, correct sacks your thoughts here on balancing 230 with the fact that I think we all agree that these [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3464.56s)]
*  Algorithms are the new modern-day editors. I don't agree. I have a very different opinion on this [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3472.0s)]
*  And I always have well first of all, let me just speak to the the legal precedent here last year [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3477.8s)]
*  There were two Supreme Court decisions addressing this very issue of whether [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3483.6s)]
*  algorithms basically [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3488.32s)]
*  Obviated 230 protection and the court found that they didn't there were a couple of cases involving [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3490.64s)]
*  in [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3496.52s)]
*  Users who basically went down a rabbit hole of like terrorist videos and got recruited by Isis [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3497.68s)]
*  Remember this yes, and they were sued by the families of victims or at least the social networks were and the argument was that they basically [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3504.6s)]
*  had been recruited into Isis and committed the terrorism because of [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3512.7999999999997s)]
*  The algorithms and the social networks were liable for that [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3516.56s)]
*  Supreme Court found that they weren't which is just to say that algorithms were not treated differently [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3520.04s)]
*  Than if the content had been on a regular feed, you know [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3525.88s)]
*  It's a chronological feed and what section 230 says is that you can only hold the user liable [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3530.44s)]
*  We're going to treat social networks as distributors not publishers for the purpose of user-generated content [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3536.92s)]
*  I've long held the view that if you want to make online platforms liable as publishers [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3543.52s)]
*  For every piece of user-generated content, then you're gonna have very little free speech left [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3550.12s)]
*  Because I just think that corporate risk aversion is gonna force these guys to become even more [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3555.44s)]
*  Sensorious than they already are every piece of content that could potentially lead to a lawsuit is [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3560.48s)]
*  Gonna get shut down and I think that the net effect of that will be much more negative [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3566.64s)]
*  Now to the argument about aren't algorithms just the new editors? I don't I don't think so [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3572.48s)]
*  I think there's a fundamental difference between what an editor does and what an algorithm does if you look at an [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3578.08s)]
*  Editorial page of the New York Times the Wall Street Journal [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3583.32s)]
*  It has a very specific point of view that is promoting in fact [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3585.76s)]
*  Sometimes you can't tell the op-ed page from the news page [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3590.36s)]
*  because it seems like that publication is so biased in favor of one point of view or another and [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3593.6s)]
*  Algorithm isn't supposed to do that an algorithm is supposed to give you more of what you want [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3599.6s)]
*  And so therefore if you are pro Trump, you'll see more pro Trump content [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3603.96s)]
*  If you're pro Kamala Harris, you'll see more Harris content [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3608.52s)]
*  In other words X or whatever the platform is isn't supposed to be taking an editorial position on whether it supports [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3611.92s)]
*  Trump or Harris but rather is giving you more of what you want [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3619.6s)]
*  Elon recently spoke to this that he had a tweet recently where he talked about hey people are coming to him saying hey [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3623.12s)]
*  I'm seeing all these like offensive things in my feed. Why is this? Well, it turns out that they had been sharing [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3629.92s)]
*  Those posts that were offensive to them and so they were seeing more of them and that's a really good example of how the algorithm [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3636.76s)]
*  Just gives you more of what you're interacting with [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3643.92s)]
*  So don't interact with outrage porn if you don't want to be outraged stop interacting with outrage porn and you'll see less of it [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3646.72s)]
*  I just think that is fundamentally different than having an editorial point of view [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3653.36s)]
*  X does not have an editorial point of view that it wants you to see more of that outrage [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3657.4s)]
*  it's simply the user is making clicks and [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3662.34s)]
*  You know clicking a share button in a way that it interprets it to be saying [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3666.0s)]
*  Oh this user wants more of that content. Yes, and so this is why I don't think that all of a sudden section 230 protection should be [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3670.28s)]
*  voided I [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3678.28s)]
*  Just think it's a fundamentally different thing than what a publisher does [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3679.64s)]
*  I have a third view and I'll bring you in on this discussion here Freedberg is that these algorithms have come become so powerful [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3683.02s)]
*  they are even better than editors at [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3690.68s)]
*  Catering to users needs because they're obviously [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3694.2s)]
*  one-to-one casting right and so this is a perfect opportunity not to get rid of 230 but to evolve it and as I said in [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3696.9199999999996s)]
*  That previous clip, you know [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3704.7999999999997s)]
*  There is a big issue as to who's making these algorithms in the case of tik-tok the Chinese government's influence and [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3706.4599999999996s)]
*  You know, what is their intention and are they being thoughtful about it because they are powerful and what responsibility did they take? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3713.52s)]
*  Is the responsibility stopping at increasing the session because if you want to increase a session [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3720.2s)]
*  All you have to do is keep showing more rage and getting people more upset and that leads to division in society and all kinds [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3725.44s)]
*  Of weird things that can occur and so empowering users and having more transparency would be a great way for the government [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3732.2799999999997s)]
*  For individuals who are frustrated with this and the platforms to find some common ground and involved. What do you think of this? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3740.44s)]
*  possibility Friedberg of [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3747.3199999999997s)]
*  Maybe you come to YouTube and instead of shutting down to 30 and causing chaos to your point sacks [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3749.32s)]
*  Which I agree with that it would cause chaos and more censoring [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3754.38s)]
*  Just saying to people. Hey [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3757.52s)]
*  Welcome to YouTube. Here are three ways you can view your content by default [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3759.6000000000004s)]
*  You can pick our algorithm you can pick an education leaning algorithm [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3764.04s)]
*  You can pick a music leaning algorithm or you could have no algorithm at all and you'll just be faced with a directory [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3768.0800000000004s)]
*  What do you think of that as a maybe a middle ground here? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3774.92s)]
*  I'm not sure that giving people a choice of an algorithm is gonna work consumers just [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3779.44s)]
*  Want to have stuff that? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3784.56s)]
*  incites emotion [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3786.6800000000003s)]
*  There's a reason you know horror movies do well and also romantic comedies and also adventure films [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3788.36s)]
*  Like they're all emotive at the end of the day the more emotive something is the more emotionally inciting it is [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3794.44s)]
*  the more likely you are to kind of want to have something like that again, and so that's simply the nature of how [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3800.0s)]
*  You know humans [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3808.08s)]
*  interact with the world around them when something is emotionally inciting you want more of it and you get more of it and that [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3810.36s)]
*  Creates the dopamine and that drives the behavior the crazy thing about social media or digital media [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3815.56s)]
*  Firstly is that the cycle the feedback cycles much faster used to be that you put out a book [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3821.04s)]
*  you wouldn't get the results on how the book sold and how many people liked it and how many people read it till a year later and [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3826.56s)]
*  Then with movies you get results in a weekend [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3832.0s)]
*  But with social media you get results instantly when a piece of content comes out online you get an instant result and [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3834.44s)]
*  Then with the concept of a feed where the next content is dynamically selected for you based on your reaction to the content prior to it [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3840.2000000000003s)]
*  You kind of get this immediate feedback loop that then tunes and lines up the next thing and now you're getting hundreds of iterations an [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3848.2400000000002s)]
*  Hour, so I'm not sure that there's really this like simple solve where let me show you something [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3853.76s)]
*  that's like less inciting at the end of the day if it's something that's horrific or something that's [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3858.4s)]
*  Romantic or something that's inspiring if it's emotionally kind of activating enough [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3862.6s)]
*  You're gonna be happy watching the next one. You're gonna keep watching and you're gonna keep watching it [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3867.16s)]
*  I think there's a there is a relatively easy solve which is you could simply open source the algorithm like X has done [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3870.4s)]
*  So we can see is it messing with your mind or not? Is it actually biased? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3877.4s)]
*  Are they actually inserting editorial opinions into the algorithm? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3882.12s)]
*  And so if you open source it people can see what it's doing [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3887.32s)]
*  I actually I hear this point of view a lot that social media is only preying on negative emotions [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3889.92s)]
*  That argument is made a lot by people who want to regulate it more and they want more censorship [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3894.92s)]
*  And that's why they're making that kind of argument. I don't think that the algorithm is only reacting to outrage or incitement [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3899.6800000000003s)]
*  I think quite the contrary what I've seen on my ex feed is that it's showing me more stuff that I like and I'm that's right [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3906.28s)]
*  I mean the algorithm has gotten so good. Yeah, like if you go on YouTube, I got I [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3912.48s)]
*  Love watching like videos of mountain biking [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3916.7599999999998s)]
*  I see like all these crazy mountain biking videos now and I love watching I'm like dude. This is awesome [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3918.8799999999997s)]
*  It's like I don't think it's not making me angry [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3923.7999999999997s)]
*  I hear what you're saying, but I would just I would offer something slightly different which is I think that these algorithms [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3926.08s)]
*  Focus on momentum. So meaning if freeberg spends the next [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3931.7599999999998s)]
*  15 minutes looking at mountain biking videos the momentum shifts the mountain biking if he then goes to surfing the algorithm goes to that [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3936.52s)]
*  That's right. Yeah [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3943.36s)]
*  And the reason is that the way that these if you go back to the actual [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3944.36s)]
*  Models themselves the way that they're architected right? Like if you look inside of a transformer, what is it? [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3949.2s)]
*  There's a neural network part and then there's a self-attention part. What is the self-attention thing trying to do? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3954.48s)]
*  It's trying to figure out the momentum and the importance of a given input [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3959.44s)]
*  So the core structure of the way that like we've solved the problem today [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3963.4s)]
*  Is erring towards a thing where if actors in the system [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3968.8s)]
*  Wanted to create momentum in one direction versus the other [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3975.52s)]
*  They can probably do it before they get caught because the algorithms will amplify that and I think this is the whole point [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3979.6000000000004s)]
*  Where these blackout videos it's not as if somebody wanted to consume that per se as much as there was a moment [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3986.96s)]
*  In time where the momentum was towards those videos a large swap of people got it and then the [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=3993.72s)]
*  Unfortunate tragedy is the very small percentage of people acted on it and were killed [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4001.4399999999996s)]
*  This can happen over and over and over again and all kinds of different things [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4005.9199999999996s)]
*  And I think that's what needs to be addressed and maybe a 10 year old shouldn't be allowed to use tick-tock without any supervision [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4010.24s)]
*  Maybe that's a better answer that could be a better answer [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4015.7599999999998s)]
*  I think based on some of our discussions, you know [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4018.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4020.68s)]
*  having kids not have these phones at school and putting them into the pouches and no social media until you're 16 or 17 because [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4021.3999999999996s)]
*  One of the other things that's happening here is these algorithms are so good [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4027.9199999999996s)]
*  that [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4032.56s)]
*  they are now causing a [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4033.9199999999996s)]
*  dopamine deficiency in children and it's causing depression because you can get [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4036.56s)]
*  Desensitized and error-free and you can get a lot of people to get depressed and you can get a lot of people to get depressed [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4041.52s)]
*  and every time you swipe up you get a dopamine hit and then your brain gets reset and [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4047.88s)]
*  You have less ability to get joy from having dinner with your family or playing cards with your friends or doing any other things [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4052.92s)]
*  And that's what doom scrolling does. That's why we lost you sacks to the poker game [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4061.44s)]
*  You're too busy doom scrolling and you got addicted to it and you don't come to poker anymore [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4064.94s)]
*  But this is what we need to do as a society. These phones are destroying everybody's lives. They're killing friendships [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4068.96s)]
*  They're killing these poor kids who are sitting there like zombies [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4074.96s)]
*  The algorithm is just too good. We have now the snake [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4078.96s)]
*  I will agree with that to some degree that I waste way too much time using X [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4083.0s)]
*  But I mean I just do it to stay up on current events so I can do this pod [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4087.96s)]
*  Yes [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4092.52s)]
*  I could just stop using it. That'd be great. I'd love to have that time back and just read more books [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4095.52s)]
*  I'm you know what I'm gonna do it with you [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4099.639999999999s)]
*  We're gonna go on a little social media diet you and I from now on we're gonna go for you [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4102.16s)]
*  But I'm saying you have lost your mind [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4106.08s)]
*  Your mind you need a detox [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4109.879999999999s)]
*  Detox no [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4113.12s)]
*  Like on Putin's payroll now [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4115.36s)]
*  My friend comrade sacks you're like the reincarnation of Joe McCarthur [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4119.36s)]
*  Yes, since you want to go into Russia here we go [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4124.719999999999s)]
*  It's 50 days on the brain and as predicted [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4128.7s)]
*  We're 50 days before the election and who shows up Putin. This is the greatest story ever. Ah [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4133.7s)]
*  For those of you listening sacks just rolled his eyes. It's so funny. This is just great. Okay [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4140.82s)]
*  There's gonna be another Russia gate hoax [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4148.06s)]
*  And by the way, there's breaking news more Russian stuff is dropped while we're on the pod [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4151.62s)]
*  There's a lot of people who started with Trump derangement syndrome and then they held Putin responsible for Trump being elected [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4156.46s)]
*  So the TDS became PDS [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4163.1s)]
*  Arrangement syndrome, but let's get to the story here [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4166.42s)]
*  I think this whole story is such a waste of time. We shouldn't even waste time on it [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4171.02s)]
*  Well, we're gonna do it anyway. So here we go. The DOJ discharged two Russian media operatives with infiltrating [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4174.9s)]

*  But people quickly figured out who it was because of their location [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4231.58s)]
*  The company's called tenant media founded in [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4234.82s)]

*  Okay, we've heard this from [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4263.34s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy we've heard this from a whole host of other people. We've now heard this from the DOJ [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4265.54s)]
*  There is an inextricable link [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4272.18s)]
*  Between the media and the people that pay for the media that want to influence what the media says [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4275.3s)]
*  We know that to be true now in this specific case. I hope the DOJ runs is the ground and gets and gets [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4281.02s)]
*  Justice served what I would say generally is the most incredible decision we ever made is to not have ads [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4289.26s)]
*  It has been the single biggest clarifying function for our ability to maintain [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4297.66s)]
*  our own opinions and be [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4304.7s)]

*  It's allowed us to evolve if we were sort of characters in a movie. We will have gone through different [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4310.74s)]
*  Transitions frankly as as these last four years have gone by I think that that would have been much harder to do [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4317.02s)]
*  If we had people paying us money. Yes, so this is just yet another example of [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4322.740000000001s)]
*  Your media diet the more it can come from people who don't need to make money from this [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4329.34s)]
*  the better off you will be because you will get earnest opinions and what will happen is whether it's [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4335.02s)]
*  Large multinational corporations or foreign state actors. They are going to find [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4341.46s)]

*  I mean is that you all agree with that or not? I mean, I agree. It was a great move to not have advertising. Sure [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4356.9800000000005s)]
*  Because it yeah, the zero pressure from anybody calling us saying we're gonna pull our ad spots and also makes the pot easy to listen to [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4362.58s)]
*  None of us need the money these personalities Tim pool Benny Johnson Dave room and Lauren Southern [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4368.5s)]
*  Have I think most of them have come out and said they didn't know the indictment says that they didn't know these [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4374.22s)]
*  Podcasters and the indictment also says they were paid huge sums of money upwards of a hundred thousand dollars per episode to do this and [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4380.06s)]
*  It's unclear what they were asked to do in the indictment, but there are some fresher techniques to [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4386.98s)]
*  produce [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4394.66s)]
*  Tweets around certain things that the Russians wanted propagated what pressure techniques? [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4396.9400000000005s)]
*  They said in the indictment that they wanted [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4404.1s)]
*  More traffic because they weren't hitting their traffic numbers and to please amplify different videos and tweets [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4408.22s)]
*  That were pro-russian. So that's in the indictment. So I guess the question then sacks for you is totally mischaracterizing this [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4414.780000000001s)]
*  I mean what was mischaracterized I would never mischaracterize this and I literally would never I have no [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4422.820000000001s)]
*  Worst in the race here. There's no reason for me to mischaracterize it. So what am I missing? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4428.38s)]
*  What am I getting wrong? You do have a horse in the race [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4431.9400000000005s)]
*  You believe you're a Russian gate hoax for many years and you want to basically try and restart that whole thing [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4433.900000000001s)]
*  That's not true. You can ask me. I think Russia I've told this to you many times Russia's sole goal is to do [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4438.860000000001s)]
*  Is to sow division between? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4445.34s)]
*  People in this country I refuse to allow it to do so on this podcast or between you and I the Russians just want to [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4448.06s)]
*  Produce chaos they do it on all sides. They get green party people they get Democratic people [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4455.5s)]
*  Okay, then my I have said since the beginning that the KGB's technique in America is to sow division [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4462.06s)]
*  That's their sole goal. They don't care who wins [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4468.74s)]
*  They just want us to not pay attention to what they're doing in Ukraine or what's happening in Russia. That's okay [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4470.900000000001s)]
*  So so I think the place to start is [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4476.5199999999995s)]
*  With asking the question who is Lauren Chen and what is Tenant Media and what has been their objective or what's their agenda? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4479.44s)]
*  And their agenda now for months has been what's called division grifting inside the conservative movement [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4486.839999999999s)]
*  Lauren Chen's been putting out a lot of tweets explaining to people that they should vote against Trump [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4493.679999999999s)]
*  She's been saying that he has gone soft on issues like abortion. She's been pushing a very [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4499.639999999999s)]
*  Tough pro-life message. She's been promoting a [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4505.4800000000005s)]
*  I'd say strange and almost fanatical idea that we should repeal the 19th Amendment [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4510.16s)]
*  which [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4515.8s)]
*  Gave women the right to vote no one in the conservative movement seriously thinks this and because of these positions [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4516.84s)]
*  She was already being called out by people like Ashley Sinclair and Mike Cernovich who said something's not right here [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4523.12s)]
*  This seems like an op like these [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4529.8s)]
*  Positions don't really make any sense. It seems like she's just causing mischief [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4532.52s)]
*  so the place to start here is to recognize that if [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4537.24s)]
*  The Russians were paying Tenant Media to put out [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4542.4800000000005s)]
*  Content that content was actually anti Trump. It was trying to get people to vote against Trump [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4546.04s)]
*  So I think the place you have to start is by asking the question [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4551.72s)]
*  Why would Vladimir Putin want to get Kamala Harris elected? [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4554.36s)]
*  In fact Putin just came out today and announced his endorsement of [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4557.84s)]
*  Kamala Harris so perhaps the Russians have an agenda to get Harris elected [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4562.360000000001s)]
*  I could see why she is the much weaker candidate. She's afraid to take questions on the tarmac Trump is strong [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4568.04s)]
*  He's authoritative and I could see why they might prefer to have a president Harris than a president Trump [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4575.12s)]
*  Let me just stop there and get your reaction to that Jake. Oh [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4581.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think the sewing [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4584.84s)]
*  Cernovich's point like that. They just want to sow division and cause chaos is the key point [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4588.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't think that Putin cares who wins. I think he just wants chaos here and he wants distraction [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4593.12s)]
*  So whether he flips he wants Kamala he wants Hillary, you know, he wants Trump. I think he just wants [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4599.04s)]
*  KGB does that's what the KGB has always done is try to get people to not believe reality [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4606.5599999999995s)]
*  And and that is their playbook for all history [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4611.959999999999s)]
*  they want to demoralize a population to not believe in their institutions to not believe facts and if [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4614.78s)]
*  It seems like there it's working pretty well here in the United States. I think that [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4622.36s)]
*  This is all widely overstated, but to the extent we're gonna deal with it at all. I think it's really interesting [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4626.799999999999s)]
*  how when [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4631.799999999999s)]
*  the Russian operation benefits Kamala Harris [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4633.5599999999995s)]
*  Nobody accuses her of collusion or being a puppet of Russia. They just say it's about sewing division, but [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4636.92s)]
*  You just did that right now no no what up happened with Kamala I'm not aware [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4646.240000000001s)]
*  Was there a saying that with tenant media? It's benefiting her. I just explained how oh, yeah [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4650.08s)]
*  Double standard there's a double standard in the coverage here and how it's interpreted when the op when the alleged op [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4657.02s)]
*  Benefits Harris it has nothing to do with Harris when the alleged op benefits Trump Trump must be a Russian agent must be a Russian [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4664.32s)]
*  Puppet there must have been collusion and you were among the forefront of people saying that [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4671.6s)]
*  Trump himself was compromised now. I never said no no I have to correct that I've never said Trump was compromised [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4677.16s)]
*  I said the people around him were compromised because they kept taking meetings and money from the Russians and this is the Russian playbook [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4682.360000000001s)]
*  No, I believe you never believed in Russia gate putting the words aside and claims like this in [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4688.400000000001s)]
*  Telling me what I think you can ask me what I think and I can tell you very clearly again [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4693.76s)]
*  But I think their plan is to find simple-minded people to give them money and to cause chaos and division in our country [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4698.16s)]
*  I don't think that they got to Trump [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4705.4400000000005s)]
*  I think they got to almost everybody around him and if you look at those people who show up at [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4708.12s)]
*  Putin dinners and you look at who takes money [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4712.92s)]
*  It's all around Trump and the Russians are experts at this and they did it to the Green Party [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4715.320000000001s)]
*  They just sprinkle money around people to cause this type of chaos. That's the goal sense [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4720.12s)]
*  How many times do I got to say this to you clearly? I don't have a horse in this race [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4725.28s)]
*  I think all Americans I'll say it again so that you can understand it and the audience can understand my position very clearly [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4728.4s)]
*  Their goal is to get us to fight with each other [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4734.96s)]
*  So we don't look at their invasion of Ukraine or what's happening with the suffering of the Russian people and we as Americans [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4737.5199999999995s)]
*  Should not be partisan on this issue. We as Americans should all come together [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4744.599999999999s)]
*  You sacks me and everybody else and say we don't want the Russians [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4748.04s)]
*  interfering in our elections or causing division and [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4752.88s)]
*  We're not going to make this political look Jake out [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4755.72s)]
*  This is the third straight election in America in which we've been led to believe that there is essentially massive Russian [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4759.72s)]
*  Interference in our election, but I think we should ask what did we learn since the last two elections in 2016? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4768.92s)]
*  Okay, we had the steel dossier [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4776.04s)]
*  Which hatched the whole Russia gate hoax we subsequently found out that Hillary's campaign [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4778.64s)]
*  created the steel dossier and then that was taken up by the deep state they basically did a [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4785.0s)]
*  Investigation of the Trump campaign they went to the FISA court [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4790.24s)]
*  They lied to the FISA court and we had a two-year independent counsel investigation [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4793.12s)]
*  Based on a piece of opposition research that turned out to be completely phony [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4797.6s)]
*  But we heard every day on cable news for years that the Russians had somehow interfered in that election never proven in [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4801.48s)]
*  2020 we heard that the Russians again were interfering because you had those 51 security state operatives [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4808.8s)]
*  Say that hunter binds laptop was Russian disinformation that turned out to be a total lie. The laptop was authentic [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4815.0s)]
*  That was just a made-up story that the Russians were involved after that [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4821.28s)]
*  Let's not forget there was news guard and Hamilton 68 [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4825.0599999999995s)]
*  Which were two bogus media washtag groups that were deep state ops [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4828.639999999999s)]
*  That were designed to get conservative content censored as Russian disinformation [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4833.32s)]
*  So now after all of these ops in which it was alleged that the Russians interfere in our elections and those stories do [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4837.32s)]
*  Not be completely bogus. We now have this new one about tenant media and I don't know the truth of this story [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4844.36s)]
*  I can't say one way or another whether it's accurate or not [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4851.139999999999s)]
*  But what I've learned is not to take these things at face value and if we are to take it at face value [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4853.72s)]
*  Tenant media was working against Trump's interests. So apparently the Russians don't want Trump to win the presidential election [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4858.8s)]
*  They want Kamala Harris [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4865.96s)]
*  Yeah [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4867.56s)]
*  And I agree that Trump was not compromised by the Russians just the people around him and to recap for people since maybe they don't [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4868.08s)]
*  Remember Michael Flynn who was the national security adviser? [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4875.12s)]
*  Plead guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017 about his contacts with the Russians [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4879.0s)]
*  Paul Manafort who was the campaign chairman for Trump? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4884.639999999999s)]
*  Had ties to pro-russian figures in the Ukraine and shared polling data with the Russian Associates during the campaign [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4888.639999999999s)]
*  He was convicted of tax and bank fraud in 2018 [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4895.24s)]
*  Later pardoned by Trump like Michael Flynn was pardoned Rick Gates who was the decorated deputy chairman [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4898.92s)]
*  He worked closely with Paul Manafort. He [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4904.639999999999s)]
*  Plead guilty to conspiracy and lying to investigators George Papadopoulos [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4907.459999999999s)]
*  I won't bring up because he was kind of a joke and then Roger Stone was investigated for all his contacts with WikiLeaks [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4911.379999999999s)]
*  He was convicted of obstruction lying to Congress and witness tampering in 2019 [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4918.98s)]
*  Being convicted that's four people convicted [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4927.62s)]
*  I don't know what the point of bringing up all these investigations are when you said the most important thing which is you do not [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4930.5199999999995s)]
*  Believe that Trump was a Russian agent. You know, I think the fact despite the fact that for years, that's what Democrats maintained [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4935.38s)]
*  My maintaining is once again fourth time is that the Russians are trying to cause division in America and we shouldn't all fall for it [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4941.38s)]
*  Hey Friedberg, I think we shouldn't fall for Hamilton 68. I think we shouldn't have fallen for newscard [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4948.38s)]
*  I think we shouldn't have fallen for the Steele dossier. I think we shouldn't fall for the Russia gate hooks J Cal [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4953.26s)]
*  Stop falling for all these Russian. I agree. That's why we should be united. Let's be united freeburg [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4958.46s)]
*  You've got some passionate thoughts on Kamala Harris pivoting a little bit around her economic policies in the last week or two [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4963.22s)]
*  Let's wrap with that. What are your thoughts? No passionate thoughts J Cal [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4971.28s)]
*  Did any of you guys see that video I sent you of Kamala's campaign speech in New Hampshire yesterday [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4974.74s)]
*  So basically for the audience, yeah, she fundamentally [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4980.2s)]
*  Pivoted from a lot of the statements she made a few weeks ago that I think caused a resounding [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4983.599999999999s)]
*  Amount of commentary about being anti-business [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4990.48s)]
*  Anti-economic prosperity a lot of people called these comments socialist in nature and apparently [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=4995.08s)]
*  She heard the feedback and is now pivoting the message and pivoting the policy [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5000.959999999999s)]
*  So, you know, I think the one question to understand is how real is the pivot and how much is this about getting elected? [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5004.86s)]
*  She she made a couple of key [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5011.32s)]
*  Announcements at this campaign speech yesterday [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5013.799999999999s)]
*  The first one is that she started out saying that small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5015.799999999999s)]
*  She's proposing that we increase the startup tax deduction from five thousand dollars to fifty thousand dollars [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5020.92s)]
*  If you start up a new business and you're generating profitable income [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5027.679999999999s)]
*  You can deduct up to fifty thousand dollars on the the year that you start the company up [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5030.639999999999s)]
*  She made an emphasis on getting rid of red tape and deregulating a lot of aspects that make it hard to start companies [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5035.36s)]
*  She talked a lot about the importance of venture capital and venture dollars and that there's a goal to spur [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5042.04s)]
*  25 million new SBA loan applications by the end of her term [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5048.4s)]
*  So in the next four years, which would be a massive increase in government lending to small businesses [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5053.4s)]
*  She also stepped back the capital gains tax proposal that was made by under the Biden administration that she previously said [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5058.62s)]
*  was her policy as well and [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5066.76s)]
*  Is now proposing a [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5069.04s)]
*  28% capital gains tax instead of the 40 something percent that I think was the previous proposal [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5071.4400000000005s)]
*  So a 28% capital gains tax only applied to households with a net worth greater than a million dollars [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5076.24s)]
*  But towards the end of her speech [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5082.72s)]
*  she still talked a lot and got a lot of cheers around the idea that billionaires and [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5084.68s)]
*  big corporations need to pay their fair share and that there needs to be methods of increasing the taxation of [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5089.12s)]
*  Billionaires and big corporations as they're kind of classified by her and some of the other Democrats [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5095.72s)]
*  So, I don't know is the pivot real is she becoming more pro-business? Is she responding to the critical feedback? [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5101.4s)]
*  She's received over the last few weeks [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5107.16s)]
*  Or you know, is this just about getting elected? Is this gonna persist? Is this a change in policy Chamath? I hand it over to you. I [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5109.8s)]
*  Think that this is all the tactics leading to the debate on September the 10th [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5118.92s)]
*  I think that a lot of this polling [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5123.84s)]
*  You're seeing the sugar high [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5127.4400000000005s)]
*  fade on both sides and I think what we can [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5129.4800000000005s)]
*  Acknowledge is that the setup going into this debate is [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5134.28s)]
*  eerily reminiscent of the setup going into the first debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5138.04s)]
*  Which was a very profound sensation that there was a popular vote advantage to the Democratic candidate Hillary then Kamala now [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5143.72s)]
*  But what everybody got wrong [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5153.28s)]
*  last time and [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5156.28s)]
*  Now what people are doing a much more refined job other than Nate Silver this time around is [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5158.0s)]
*  Then being able to do a more nuanced look at the electoral college probability [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5165.0s)]
*  Which is in the opposite direction favoring Donald Trump and not Kamala [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5169.2s)]
*  So I think that the Democrats have realized that the sugar high isn't going to win the election [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5172.48s)]
*  They need to be specific in ways that gets moderates and the only way to do that is to tack to the middle [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5177.82s)]
*  Because a lot of these other trial balloons were kind of nutty and those people are not gonna win them the election in the key [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5185.139999999999s)]
*  States that matter again, I mean, you know, it's what we've said before five things in five states, right? [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5191.5599999999995s)]
*  That's what it's gonna come down to it's also I think you've made this point Chamath as well [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5196.42s)]
*  Which is when you're running for the primaries and I think Dean Phillips when he was on the program talked about this [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5201.099999999999s)]
*  You've got one agenda and that tends to be a bit extreme because you're trying to get those extreme people in primaries to come out [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5206.58s)]
*  Then when you get to the general election you kind of come towards the middle and we said on this very podcast [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5213.26s)]
*  And I gave a couple of disclaimers as the moderator here. Hey, we don't know these are communist policies because a she's not talking to anybody B [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5218.62s)]
*  She hasn't released any so [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5225.78s)]
*  Maybe you know, she's taking feedback [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5228.38s)]
*  I have some inside information on this which is there are people in our circles who are sitting with her saying [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5230.86s)]
*  These things are crazy [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5237.54s)]
*  and maybe pointing to our podcast and other reactions online and [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5239.86s)]
*  Maybe we should really think what do you want to do? [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5244.58s)]
*  Potentially madam president when your president if you do win and I think she's starting to think from first principles [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5249.339999999999s)]
*  Hey, what is actually good for the countries that would be a very honest way of looking at the first principles [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5256.54s)]
*  Are you kidding? She's reading from a teleprompter? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5262.84s)]
*  No, no, I'm talking about in her policies [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5264.98s)]
*  I knew you can you can make whatever digs you want to her style and that's valid [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5266.92s)]
*  You can make whatever digs you want to Trump style. What I'm talking about is you said she got first principles [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5270.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think well from her first principles as writers are giving her new talking points. Okay, listen [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5274.8s)]
*  Can you stop with the personal attacks on people and just? [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5279.26s)]
*  She's a candidate for the presidency United States [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5282.86s)]
*  He's answering your question Jake how he's saying that they're not real policy [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5286.54s)]
*  And then you can have to ride her style I'm trying to [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5291.5s)]
*  Jason it's a substance. Okay, let me finish my point and then you can talk about substance or style [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5295.62s)]
*  I think what happened here is she was put into the position as president and had to in a very short period of time come [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5300.1s)]
*  Up with what her positions would be because everybody knows when you're the vice president your positions are what the president thinks [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5306.98s)]
*  We've made that point about JD Vance that his position on wanting a national abortion ban has nothing to do with Trump's and Trump's wins [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5312.86s)]
*  In that situation. So here we are. I think it's a similar situation Biden might have been captured and wanted to do this crazy [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5319.46s)]
*  Wealth tax and this you know seizure of people's assets [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5326.9s)]
*  Whereas maybe she actually is much more moderate and that's what people around her have always said is that she's more moderate and that she's coming [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5330.099999999999s)]
*  to actually [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5336.0599999999995s)]
*  Form her own platform and she just needed time to do that. I'm giving what I'm hearing from the left [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5337.42s)]
*  This isn't necessarily my position sacks. This is what I'm hearing from the people around [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5343.26s)]
*  Kamala Harris. Okay. Let me tell you what's really going on here [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5347.9400000000005s)]
*  Time democratic pundit Roy to share I just had a piece out called Vince Lombardi Democrats [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5356.74s)]
*  Where he quoted Vince Lombardi saying winning isn't everything [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5362.22s)]
*  It's the only thing and so obviously what's happening now is that Kamala Harris will say whatever she needs in order to win [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5366.22s)]
*  But the question that voters should be asking who is this person really? [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5374.14s)]
*  Because obviously what she's gonna do once you give her the keys to the government is gonna be different than whatever [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5378.18s)]
*  She's saying right now and we do have a lot of background on this person. She came up through the San Francisco political machine [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5384.740000000001s)]
*  She was a product of the progressive [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5390.3s)]
*  Pelosi machine in San Francisco she then rose to the Senate [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5394.1s)]
*  She was voted by Gov track as the most liberal member of the Senate and just a few weeks ago when she first announced her economic proposals [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5398.5s)]
*  They were all this super far left stuff like the unrealized gains tax and a forty four percent cap gains rate [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5405.74s)]
*  So that's where her instincts were that was what was in the Biden Harris budget that was in her campaign platform [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5413.7s)]
*  And that was in her economic policy speeches and then what happened is there was a huge negative reaction to all of that [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5420.099999999999s)]
*  So now she's changing her talking points, but it's obvious what's going on [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5425.86s)]
*  She's gonna say whatever is necessary to win the election [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5429.54s)]
*  But you're a fool and kidding yourself if you think you're gonna get something really different after the election [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5432.98s)]
*  You're gonna get a continuation of the Biden [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5439.94s)]
*  Harris Elizabeth Warren economic program that we've had for the last four years [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5444.0199999999995s)]
*  How would you say Trump's [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5448.22s)]
*  Position on abortion relates to that, you know, don't don't people adapt their position based on winning [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5450.42s)]
*  I mean, I think he's done a master class in changing his position and jay's never changed his position. You don't seem to understand [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5455.620000000001s)]
*  How that issue works? He was in favor of returning to the states [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5461.9400000000005s)]
*  He's been completely consistent on that and I don't know why you keep bringing it back to that always whenever Kamala Harris isn't doing well [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5467.3s)]
*  It's always about abortion for you. No, I think it's a great example of [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5474.14s)]
*  Politician moving to the center on the issue. He just said this week that he wants more than six weeks, right? [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5478.54s)]
*  And so he's moving towards a he didn't just say that it's always been his position. He's always been a moderate on the issue Jake out [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5483.02s)]
*  Yeah [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5488.780000000001s)]
*  He's against the national abortion ban. He's always been in favor of returning to the states [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5489.620000000001s)]
*  I don't even understand how this is like you're still talking about this [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5493.02s)]
*  Well, the reason I talk about it is because there's so many states including the one I'm living in where women can't get an abortion [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5496.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay, they're gonna have to cross the state line. You're right. That's an issue [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5502.54s)]
*  So, I mean I think women feel differently about it than you know, you brushing it aside they feel that Trump [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5505.26s)]
*  I'm not right. I'm just stating what the truth the issue is. Yeah. No, no [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5509.84s)]
*  I'm just saying the truth for women that I if you want to vote on that issue, that's your right [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5512.900000000001s)]
*  Go for it. All I ask is that you correctly state Trump's position on that issue, which he stated on our own podcast [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5517.14s)]
*  Yeah, that's the point I'm bringing up is that people the evangelicals are really upset about him in their perception [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5523.38s)]
*  Changing his mind and women their view of it is he took away their right in the states where like the one I live in [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDR2dWEQqKw&t=5530.639999999999s)]
