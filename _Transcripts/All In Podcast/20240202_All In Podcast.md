**All In Podcast:** [February 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c)
*  Alright, everybody, welcome back to your favorite podcast. The [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=0.0s)]
*  all in podcast. It's Episode 164. I'm down here in Miami [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3.44s)]
*  with me again. Of course, the dictator chairman himself, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=8.16s)]
*  Tomof Pali Hoppitea, and the Rain Man. Yeah, burn baby David [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Sachs. Unfortunately, we had a little bit of a challenge this [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=17.68s)]
*  week. We don't know where Friedberg is he somewhere lost [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=22.0s)]
*  in his Apple Vision pros, but he'll be back next week. As you [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=24.12s)]
*  guys know, I'm incredibly generous with my friends. So I [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=27.6s)]
*  sent all the besties the Apple Pro goggles. And so these Apple [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=30.96s)]
*  Pro goggles are amazing. But you bought me a pair of the Apple [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=36.04s)]
*  Pro. Yeah, we talked about this. Yeah, they're all you guys [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=40.84s)]
*  actually you were using them. You just forgot. But Friedberg [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=43.72s)]
*  has been using them. Nobody can find Friedberg right now. Because [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=46.36s)]
*  apparently, he went to Uranus, I recorded in all of these sacks. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=49.88s)]
*  What's happening inside each of our Apple goggles. Vision Pro. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=55.08s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And so but I just about here they are. We actually [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=61.2s)]
*  took a picture. I had not take a picture of you wearing them. Do [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=63.92s)]
*  you want to have a section want to see what Chamath was doing in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=66.52s)]
*  his goggles? Yeah, let's see. I recorded it. Oh, yeah. Look at [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  that. See, he he imagined that he did leg day. Look at those [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=72.84s)]
*  legs. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=76.6s)]
*  He's still reveling in that thirst trap that he posted in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=80.76s)]
*  I know, but you see those legs. The Apple Vision Pro Tim Cook. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=83.84s)]
*  Can I sorry, can I say that? Can I say something funny about [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=87.12s)]
*  this, which is that my legs are actually darker than my torso [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=90.28s)]
*  and my upper body. It's the weirdest thing. And so you have [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=95.48s)]
*  it in reverse. But it is true that my my legs are a different [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=98.16s)]
*  shade than my my trunk and my arms and my body. Okay. Well, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=101.0s)]
*  here's sacks. By the way, sacks. You know, he loves his goggles. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Chamath. You have any interest in seeing what sacks [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=107.16s)]
*  was doing with his goggles? Oh, my god, I can't imagine. There [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=108.8s)]
*  it is. Sacks was speed running. He was doing the speed run on [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=112.56s)]
*  DJ. Absolutely getting in there. That's saving Private Ryan, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=116.28s)]
*  right? Yeah, that's you. That's you. You were speed running, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=121.08s)]
*  saving Private Ryan there. Oh, I got them too. Yes. But I didn't [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=123.28s)]
*  record myself. I didn't record myself. I maybe nicked it. Oh, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=126.36s)]
*  I was in there. Oh, look, what am I doing? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=129.24s)]
*  Wait, you're telling me that they didn't have the third or [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=142.56s)]
*  fourth investor and Uber up but ringing the bell with them at [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=145.2s)]
*  the original moment? I could tell you the backstory. I was [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=148.36s)]
*  invited by TK to come to the the ring of the bell. TK was [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=151.08s)]
*  disinvited. So he was there on the floor. It was very awkward. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=157.8s)]
*  And then they didn't have him go to the ring of the bell. So [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=162.04s)]
*  they were like, Oh, I'm going to go to the ring of the bell. And [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  it was very awkward. And then they didn't have him go up and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=169.4s)]
*  ring the bell or be even there when Darrell rang the bell. It [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  was because it was controversial. They didn't. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=176.04s)]
*  They banned him. Really, it was really sad. It was super sad. But [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=178.84s)]
*  anyway, everybody, I hope you're enjoying your [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  sorry, you're not there or not. I didn't go because he was like, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=186.28s)]
*  I'm we're gonna have a party. But we're not going to be able to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=190.8s)]
*  ring the bell. And it was just all like very did you go to the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=194.2s)]
*  party? I didn't I should have regret not going but it was [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=196.92s)]
*  unclear if there was even going to be a party or TK was going to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=200.44s)]
*  go because of all the drama and I don't know if you remember on [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=202.76s)]
*  CNBC they were like, TK is in the building but he's not on the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=205.2s)]
*  thing and that became a big brouhaha. But yes, I miss my [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  window. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=212.44s)]
*  I mean, if you had known that this was gonna be the big exit [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  in your life, really the only one, then you would have made [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=216.2s)]
*  every effort to attend everything, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=219.44s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, you're still riding on [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=222.48s)]
*  that Yammer and PayPal. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=225.24s)]
*  I was I was talking to somebody about this the other day. Most [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=229.0s)]
*  people's careers you have like, you know, it's not like a smooth [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  up to upward trajectory. There's like maybe a few pops that you [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=236.16s)]
*  get. You're lucky actually, if you get a few because most people [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=239.28s)]
*  only have one or maybe two. Yes. It's like a power law. It's [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=242.68s)]
*  like anything else in venture, right? Absolutely. Like I'm sure [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=246.24s)]
*  if you think back on like the big outcomes in your life, it's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=248.72s)]
*  not like there's one every year and like some sort of smooth [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=251.48000000000002s)]
*  gradient. It's basically there's like one, two or three over the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=254.52s)]
*  course of your entire career that you remember. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=258.32s)]
*  Right? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, it's it's good. It's good [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=260.64s)]
*  to consider that because you have to enjoy every sandwich, you [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=264.6s)]
*  have to enjoy every day what you're doing because those pops [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=269.16s)]
*  are out of your control. You don't know when they're gonna [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=272.36s)]
*  happen, how they're gonna manifest. So but you guys didn't [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=274.04s)]
*  get these. You didn't get the goggles, but these goggles came [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=277.72s)]
*  out this week. I don't know if you saw it. What I will say is [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  at the poker game, three of the guys were talking about these [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=282.72s)]
*  goggles. Ah, Sammy woke up at five in the morning on the first [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=286.08000000000004s)]
*  day. He was he got them. And then Kuhn and Robl were telling [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=290.72s)]
*  me that they just like bought them randomly in the next couple [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=294.68s)]
*  of days. And it was civilians. There was no like waiting in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=297.68s)]
*  line. They were able to just order them as what they do. Yes. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=301.72s)]
*  But they're civilians. So just to be clear, like in Silicon [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=304.28000000000003s)]
*  Valley, we're kind of like, whatever, you know, we've played [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=306.96000000000004s)]
*  with Oculus for so long. But now these are out. And there's a [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=311.16s)]
*  bunch of demos going around. This one I thought was [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  interesting. I don't know if you saw this, but watching a [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=315.92s)]
*  basketball game, it actually is quite compelling to have all the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  stats on the screen with you. And you can kind of move them [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=320.6s)]
*  around. I maybe could see myself doing this. I don't know. Do you [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  think you would do this? Watching a game maybe? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=326.48s)]
*  So are you actually watching the TV through the goggles? Like [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=328.76000000000005s)]
*  what part is real world? And what part is augmented? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=332.48s)]
*  Obviously, all the stats are augmented reality. Yeah, this is [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=335.32000000000005s)]
*  the TV itself is, is that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=339.08s)]
*  that's a stream. That's a stream coming into the goggles. Yeah, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=340.96s)]
*  it's not your actual TV. So you know, I think he's just putting [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=343.68s)]
*  it on the TV there. But you could literally be outside on [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=346.64s)]
*  your deck, you could be on an airplane and do this. So that's [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=350.08s)]
*  like, you can see through the goggles, right? Is that the idea? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=353.04s)]
*  It's, you can, if you want to, I think you can still see through [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=355.56s)]
*  the goggles. Yeah, is the idea. Yeah, you know, you could you [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=358.68s)]
*  can see the fact that you live in a tattered apartment without a [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=361.44s)]
*  girlfriend dressed poorly. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=365.08s)]

*  it very well about the the Oculus one, which is you had to [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=404.56s)]
*  turn a phrase which I really liked. But basically, it's like, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  you were very quick to try it. And then there was like a period [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=412.32s)]

*  key thing with this. And the fact that it costs $3,500, they [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=418.64s)]
*  have to get the price down fast enough for average folks to want [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=422.68s)]

*  I don't know if that's actually real yet. But do you see that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=467.68s)]
*  demo? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=471.12s)]

*  right, but he put out a demo that was a little different. The [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=487.96s)]
*  demo was like he was in his closet. He was wearing this and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=490.28s)]
*  he had picked out a shirt or something. And that's like, give [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=494.03999999999996s)]
*  me, you know, tell me what I should match this with. Yeah, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=496.2s)]

*  front of the Senate? Yeah, we might as well I guess we'll just [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=505.91999999999996s)]
*  jump right to that. It was like a public flogging. Yeah, once [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=507.96s)]
*  again, a public flogging. We'll just jump to it real quick since [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=511.96s)]
*  we didn't want to go too deep on that one. But Josh Holley made [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=514.72s)]
*  Zach turn around and apologize to two people in the audience. It [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=517.68s)]
*  was really intense. Yeah. So this is the name of this [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=522.16s)]
*  hearing was Big Tech and online child sexual exploitation crisis [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=524.76s)]

*  discord x and snap. But obviously this is all around [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=531.48s)]
*  kids online safety and also section 230, which I think these [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=534.5200000000001s)]
*  senators are this is one of the few bipartisan moments I think [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  they're honing in on it. Yeah, they realize this is kind of like [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=542.96s)]
*  a we're gonna take a run at this they're taking a run on it for [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=546.48s)]
*  sure. They realize it's a winning ticket. Let's just play [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=549.24s)]
*  the clip and then I'll get your thoughts, Saxon and Jamaa. Let me [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=551.96s)]
*  ask you this. There's families of victims here. There's a lot [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  of victims. There's a lot of victims. There's a lot of [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=556.9200000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you this. There's families of victims here today. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=559.64s)]
*  Have you apologized to the victims? I would you like to do [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=561.96s)]
*  so now? Well, they're here. You're on national television. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=566.4s)]
*  Would you like now to apologize to the victims who have been [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=569.48s)]
*  harmed by your product? Show them the pictures. Would you like [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=572.6s)]
*  to apologize for what you've done to these good people? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=575.88s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=581.76s)]
*  terrible. No one should have to go through the things that your [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  families have have suffered. And this is why we invest so [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=587.36s)]
*  much and are going to continue doing industry leading efforts [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=591.12s)]
*  to make sure that no one has to go through the types of things [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=594.84s)]
*  that your families have had to suffer. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=599.24s)]
*  Tax, a powerful moment. And for Zuckerberg to get up and actually [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=601.36s)]
*  face the parents he turned around he faces present very [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=605.64s)]
*  dramatic moment. And he apologized that net you respect [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=608.2s)]
*  him for for doing that. And he's thinking that was like a powerful [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=611.84s)]
*  moment as well. And where does this all wind up? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=616.16s)]
*  This was a kangaroo court. I mean, this was basically all [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  theatrics. This is basically bipartisan moral panic, where all [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=621.24s)]
*  these senators are basically grandstanding. And these are the [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=625.12s)]
*  same types of accusations that we've been hearing for years. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=627.88s)]
*  Remember, this goes back to the whole Francis Hogan claims, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=630.28s)]
*  where she says that Facebook wasn't doing enough to prevent [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=633.16s)]
*  various kinds of online harms. And I think that we're going to [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=635.88s)]
*  regret where this all leads because where it's going to lead [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=640.92s)]
*  if they do repeal section 230 is towards greater censor [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=643.0799999999999s)]
*  ship. All these companies are going to spend even more [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=646.12s)]
*  resources restricting what we can say and hear online, which [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=649.6s)]
*  is not the right direction. Listen, do some harms occur [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=654.96s)]
*  online? Yes. Do I believe that Facebook is taking substantial [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=659.32s)]
*  measures to stop them? Yes. I mean, but edge cases are always [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=662.84s)]
*  going to get through. When you're operating at that kind of [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=666.0s)]
*  scale, there are going to be these edge cases of kids who got [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=669.48s)]
*  harassed or content that shouldn't have getting through. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=673.0s)]
*  It's just part of the fact that the internet operates a [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=677.44s)]
*  gigantic scale. And these harms have always been out there. I [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=680.32s)]
*  think that these companies do their best to try and stop them. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=683.6s)]
*  But they're always going to get through and you can't make every [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=686.52s)]
*  aspect of our society perfectly safe and harm free. Somehow we [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=690.04s)]
*  have this expectation that we can eliminate 100% of every harm [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=694.52s)]
*  that occurs. And I do think that these online companies have been [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=698.68s)]
*  unfairly picked on in a sense. I mean, if you're going to talk [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=701.48s)]
*  about these types of harms, why aren't you targeting the music [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=704.48s)]
*  industry for all their incendiary lyrics that basically [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=707.84s)]
*  encourage all sorts of violent or sexist behavior? Why don't [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=710.96s)]
*  you target the advertising industry for creating unrealistic [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=715.08s)]
*  body image expectations? Why don't you target the Kardashians [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=719.24s)]
*  for setting unrealistic expectations around image? And [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=723.08s)]
*  you could go on down the list. I mean, why don't you target [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=728.5600000000001s)]
*  Hollywood for releasing a show like Euphoria, which is a hit? It [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=730.56s)]
*  seems to me that the problem in our culture is not coming from [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=734.4399999999999s)]
*  the edge cases, it's coming from the mainstream entertainment [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=737.4s)]
*  that is fully allowed and is popular and is our hit shows and [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=741.4799999999999s)]
*  hit records and hit products. I mean, that's where the toxic [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=745.28s)]
*  pollution is coming from in our culture. So to turn around and [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=749.4s)]
*  now blame the online companies for creating all of this, I [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=752.64s)]
*  think is just anything basically they're being [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=755.0799999999999s)]
*  scapegoated. I mean, again, this is a moral panic. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=756.8s)]
*  Chamath, you think it's a moral panic or you know, there have [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=760.0s)]
*  been statistics and studies done about what is viral on social [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=762.8s)]
*  media, the algorithms targeting users, the addictive nature of [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=768.24s)]
*  it, you spoke earlier about the addictive nature of just [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=771.52s)]
*  gamification on watches. Social media is a little bit different [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=773.64s)]
*  than music. And some of these other things because they have [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=776.88s)]
*  these algorithms to increase watch time and engagement. So I [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=780.12s)]
*  think that's what the other side would say, what do you say? What [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=783.28s)]
*  do you say, Chamath? Where do you stand on this? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=785.4799999999999s)]
*  Let me just give a coda to a couple things that Saks said. It [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=786.96s)]
*  is true that we've taken turns attacking other forms of media [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=790.6800000000001s)]
*  when they were ascending in their popularity. So in the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=794.82s)]
*  1990s, if you guys remember, politicians and their censorship [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=797.0400000000001s)]
*  attempts around gangster rap, and NWA and two live crew and [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=802.0400000000001s)]
*  certain songs. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=806.96s)]
*  Al Gore's wife, right? What was her name? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=808.0s)]
*  Tipper Gore. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=809.76s)]
*  Tyra against rap lyrics. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=811.84s)]
*  What was the NWA song? You know, the police, that whole [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=813.32s)]
*  thing just sent off a huge furor about people potentially David [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=816.72s)]
*  be motivated to kill cops or something, right? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=821.0400000000001s)]
*  In the 80s, there was a trial, Judas Priest went on trial. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=823.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=826.88s)]
*  Because if you played one of their records backwards, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=827.28s)]
*  supposedly promoted [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=829.6s)]
*  devil worship. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=831.64s)]
*  See, I don't know who's playing records backwards. But if you [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=832.28s)]
*  did, then it promoted devil worship. I think a kid [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=834.6s)]
*  committed suicide and so they basically prosecuted Judas [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=837.6800000000001s)]
*  Priest for it. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=840.3000000000001s)]
*  So that's comment number one, which is, this is not new. And [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=841.08s)]
*  the reason why social media is in the crosshairs is because [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=846.08s)]
*  instead of having this really diverse ecosystem of many small [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=849.0400000000001s)]
*  players, you have three or four folks. And so it's easier to [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=855.2800000000001s)]
*  bring them up on stage and sort of pillory them. Second is I [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=858.9200000000001s)]
*  actually thought that Zuck had a lot of moral clarity, because [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=862.2800000000001s)]
*  it's like, that's a tough position to be in. And the fact [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=864.4000000000001s)]
*  that he had the courage to turn around and actually apologize to [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=867.2800000000001s)]
*  those people shows he's trying to do the right thing. But the [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=869.5600000000001s)]
*  reality is, and Sachs is right, if you apply a very, very small [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=872.52s)]
*  error rate to an incredibly large number, so they have a [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=876.96s)]
*  network of three and a half billion people monthly, right, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=880.3199999999999s)]
*  or daily or whatever the thing is, even if you say that there's [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=882.92s)]
*  one tenth of 1% of an error rate, meaning things that are [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=886.72s)]
*  unintended. Well, that's 3 million unintended consequences, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=891.6s)]
*  right? That's a lot of unintended consequences. And so [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=895.68s)]
*  there's this massive law of large numbers at play. So what [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=899.24s)]
*  what do we do, I guess, is the question. And I think that [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=902.72s)]
*  there is enough [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=907.36s)]
*  knowledge that we have to know that the ability for a 35 year [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=910.04s)]
*  old to use certain products today is very different than the [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=915.76s)]
*  ability for a 12 year old to use that same product because of [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=920.6s)]
*  where they are physiologically. Right? I think we all know that [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=923.8s)]
*  to be scientifically true on the dimension of many products. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=927.48s)]
*  And I think what we need to decide as a society is whether [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=930.64s)]
*  software and electronic products fall into that categorization. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=934.2s)]
*  And if so, what does it mean? So in the case of China, they [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=937.84s)]
*  mandate top down what products can be used and how many hours [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=941.5600000000001s)]
*  you can use them for video games, you're referring to you. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=946.96s)]
*  Yeah. And David's right, which is that if we go there, and we [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=949.5600000000001s)]
*  rewrite the law, then there's going to be a different set of [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=953.44s)]
*  unintended consequences that's going to create, I think, a much [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=956.8s)]
*  poor business landscape, frankly, to innovate and a bunch [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=962.56s)]
*  of other things. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=965.5999999999999s)]
*  And building on your comments, there's clearly an age at which [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=966.28s)]
*  kids can shouldn't be on these systems and an age where, you [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=970.1999999999999s)]
*  know, maybe with some guidance, they can. Yeah, you want to add [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=974.4799999999999s)]
*  something to your mouth? Yeah. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=978.04s)]
*  And then I think the third thing is around the section 230 thing [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=978.7199999999999s)]
*  itself. I think that sax, I'll give you a slightly different [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=982.0s)]
*  take. I don't think that the section 230 rewrite is going to [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=986.16s)]
*  be broad and sweeping. What I noticed from a bipartisan [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=990.68s)]
*  perspective, by both the Democrats and the Republicans is [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=994.68s)]
*  that the one single narrow issue that they all seem to align on [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=998.04s)]
*  is not necessarily about all of the different rules around [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1004.36s)]
*  censorship, but that the lack of liability for these folks should [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1009.48s)]
*  be relieved. And I think that if you were to write a narrow [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1015.28s)]
*  amendment to section 230, that said that these social media [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1019.16s)]
*  companies or other organizations that had certain characteristics [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1022.88s)]
*  were more liable where today they have no liability. I'm not [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1026.16s)]
*  saying that it's right. But my read of the temperature in that [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1029.56s)]
*  room was that that is the very narrow change in section 230 [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1033.36s)]
*  that I think they all seem to want to make. And so that seems [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1038.44s)]
*  like a very likely thing that will happen in the next two or [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1041.8s)]
*  three years unpack that for the audience who might not know how [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1044.8s)]
*  they would do that section 230 says, if you're a publisher, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1048.04s)]
*  you're a common carrier, you're not responsible for people post [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1051.28s)]
*  on your system, blog, web host or social media company, but [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1054.3999999999999s)]
*  where the social media companies move from being just a common [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1059.0s)]
*  carrier, you know, like paper might be or a website hosting [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1062.08s)]
*  company like WordPress, or Squarespace is when they flip [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1066.24s)]
*  over and they have an algorithm and then they start picking and [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1070.28s)]
*  choosing. So once you start doing editorial, like the New [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1073.16s)]
*  York Times, and you have editors, then you're liable. If [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1075.48s)]
*  you're CNN, you're liable. If you're Fox, as we saw in the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1078.4s)]
*  Dominion case, that's where the liability comes in. So I guess [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1080.88s)]
*  the question to you, Sachs is, you know, at the end of the day, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1083.8400000000001s)]
*  now that we've seen these things at scale, is there not an [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1087.0400000000002s)]
*  argument that when you start editorializing through an [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1089.68s)]
*  algorithm, and you start promoting certain content, that [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1092.52s)]
*  you have some level of responsibility, like Fox News, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1095.48s)]
*  CNN, or the New York Times has, where would you stand on that [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1097.92s)]
*  issue, some liability if you're picking winners and losers in [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1101.0s)]
*  terms of what gets promoted in the system? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1104.16s)]
*  Well, apparently, I'm the last person in America who thinks [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1107.0s)]
*  that Section 230 was a good idea and a visionary piece of [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1109.76s)]
*  legislation that actually enabled the creation of user [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1112.4s)]
*  generated content platforms, just to kind of slightly modify [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1116.04s)]
*  your description of how it works. I would analogize it to [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1119.52s)]
*  a newsstand, where there's magazines on the newsstand, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1122.6s)]
*  their publishers, and then there's the newsstand itself, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1125.44s)]
*  which is a distributor. If a magazine engages in [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1127.6s)]
*  defamation, they're liable for it, but the newsstand is not, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1132.84s)]
*  the newsstand can't be sued. So the question is, when you have [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1136.7199999999998s)]
*  these massive user generated content platforms, are they [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1139.48s)]
*  operating as a publisher or as a distributor? And I think what [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1142.6799999999998s)]
*  Section 230 made clear is, look, if you don't write the content, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1146.24s)]
*  if the content is generated by users, you're a distributor. And [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1149.6s)]
*  that is, I believe, the better analogy to make for these huge [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1154.04s)]
*  UGC platforms. Now, at the same time, what Section 230 said, is [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1157.92s)]
*  that if you take good Samaritan actions to reduce things like [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1162.6399999999999s)]
*  sex and violence on your platforms, then we won't make [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1166.92s)]
*  you liable. Because what happens in a lot of cases is that you [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1169.76s)]
*  can waive your protection legally by basically getting [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1173.36s)]
*  involved. And so the legislation didn't want to deter these [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1177.36s)]
*  platforms for taking again, good Samaritan steps. I think [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1181.0s)]
*  it's a pretty good combination of legislation. And that's what [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1184.6s)]
*  you see right now is that Zuckerberg doesn't want to let [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1188.08s)]
*  these edge cases through. I actually believe that they are [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1190.64s)]
*  taking huge efforts at scale. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1193.04s)]
*  They have 40,000 people to give him some credit. There's 40,000 [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1195.72s)]
*  people moderating stuff. That's a big number. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1198.76s)]
*  These are edge cases that get through. And by the way, you [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1200.32s)]
*  have to wonder where were the parents when all this stuff [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1202.4s)]
*  happened? I mean, they're acting like they're victims in the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1205.28s)]
*  audience. And I'm sorry for their particular cases. But at [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1207.76s)]
*  the end of the day, we do need the parents to step up here. If [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1210.4s)]
*  we want to have social media at scale at all, the parents have [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1213.44s)]
*  to play a more active role. But in any event, to go back to [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1216.44s)]
*  Section 230, I just think that Republicans in particular are [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1218.68s)]
*  going to really regret getting rid of Section 230 because it's [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1222.2800000000002s)]
*  only going to lead to more censorship. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1227.0800000000002s)]
*  I think what they're going to do, if I had to bet is that [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1228.5600000000002s)]
*  they're going to write a very narrow amendment to that law. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1231.3200000000002s)]
*  And during some budget process or some other thing where you [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1236.4s)]
*  have a big Christmas tree bill, this will get in there. And I [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1240.2s)]
*  think it will have bipartisan support that effectively removes [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1243.8400000000001s)]
*  the liability protection that these companies have. I have a [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1247.52s)]
*  small change. That's the entirety of Section 230. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1251.6000000000001s)]
*  I think like these companies will not be able to use that. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1254.4s)]
*  That's a massive change. Listen, there are plaintiffs' [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1258.04s)]
*  lawyers. The plaintiffs' lawyers bar, you know, the trial [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1260.2s)]
*  lawyers bar is salivating over the possibility that would [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1264.0s)]
*  happen. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1268.0s)]
*  That's why this is going to happen. You know, this is how [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1268.36s)]
*  America works. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1270.8s)]
*  They have personal injury lawsuits and tort lawsuits lined [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1271.3999999999999s)]
*  up in every jurisdiction in the United States. And here's the [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1275.36s)]
*  thing is because Facebook and all these other sites operate, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1277.8s)]
*  you know, across the entire nation and across the entire [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1282.28s)]
*  world, they can be sued in every single jurisdiction. If you [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1285.56s)]
*  allow these types of lawsuits. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1290.04s)]
*  Okay, Chamath, you go, then I'm going to get my position and [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1291.28s)]
*  we'll move on. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1293.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm going to say this in as unopinionated as a way as [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1294.7199999999998s)]
*  possible, whether we like it or not. There's an element of [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1297.16s)]
*  American capitalism that takes companies through seasons. And [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1301.44s)]
*  there are seasons where you're growing. And then there are [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1306.96s)]
*  seasons where you're over earning. And then there are [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1309.52s)]
*  seasons where if it is possible, the machinery, if you see that [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1312.0400000000002s)]
*  you are being you're over earning for a long time, the [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1317.0s)]
*  machinery of the economy comes and kind of pulls you back down [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1320.44s)]
*  to Earth. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1323.64s)]
*  You've won too much. And you're perceived as too powerful. Yeah. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1324.4s)]
*  And I'm not saying this, whether or not it's right. I'm just [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1328.0400000000002s)]
*  saying it. If you look back in history, these chapters have [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1331.8000000000002s)]
*  been written umpteen times. And I and I think David, what you [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1335.3600000000001s)]
*  said is the absolute single most important thing if you have to [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1339.24s)]
*  figure out where this was going to go is exactly that the [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1343.24s)]
*  plaintiffs lawyers, the class action lawsuits, the amount of [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1348.44s)]
*  money that they think they can extract. And they compare it to [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1352.08s)]
*  the amount of money that they were able to extract in two [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1357.32s)]
*  different kinds of cases. One was tobacco. And then the second [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1360.24s)]
*  was pharma. And I think that they look at this class of app. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1365.04s)]
*  And the lack of empathy or the lack of popularity that the [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1370.4399999999998s)]
*  leaders of these companies have in Washington as a reason why [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1374.4399999999998s)]
*  they will probably be able to get this done to create this. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1379.4s)]
*  Again, I'm not saying I think that's good. I'm saying that I [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1382.6000000000001s)]
*  think it's likely. And I think when that does happen, you will [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1385.8000000000002s)]
*  see a replay. Again, it'll be slightly different in terms of [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1389.44s)]
*  how it plays out. But exactly the kinds of plaintiffs lawsuits [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1392.6000000000001s)]
*  that we saw in pharma, and in tobacco, and I think it's going [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1396.0400000000002s)]
*  to play out here. And David, you're right, that hearing to me [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1399.44s)]
*  was a setup for that. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1403.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And if you if you look at this through that lens, there [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1405.0800000000002s)]
*  will be some sort of negotiation. And it might be [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1408.48s)]
*  age, because when you look at this, really, what Americans are [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1412.04s)]
*  upset about is the impact this is having on kids. We have a [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1415.4s)]
*  limit for the age of smoking, vaping, etc. And when these [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1418.2s)]
*  things happen, I think an easy concession that Zuckerberg and [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1421.32s)]
*  others will make is hey, these products will be for 16 years [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1424.64s)]
*  old and up. That's my that's the age I think it's appropriate [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1427.2s)]
*  15 or 16 seems to be [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1430.84s)]
*  well, he also said, by the way, Jason, to your point, Lindsey [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1432.52s)]
*  Graham was the one that brought this up. And Lindsey Graham made [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1435.52s)]
*  the connection to tobacco and also to firearms. Yeah. And then [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1438.08s)]
*  Mark, at some point in there, basically said, Well, listen, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1441.48s)]
*  like, let's look at Apple and Google, we should expect them to [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1443.8799999999999s)]
*  do the actual age verification, not us. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1447.84s)]
*  Right, because they have the devices and they have credit [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1450.48s)]
*  cards, etc. That's actually a very reasonable thing for [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1452.6399999999999s)]
*  Americans to come to the only thing that breaks down a little [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1455.56s)]
*  bit, Saxon your argument, and listen, there's no perfect [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1457.52s)]
*  analogies here. But if there was a repeated offense of a magazine [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1460.1999999999998s)]
*  on a newsstand, for example, if there was some magazine that had [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1464.84s)]
*  underage, you know, an adult magazine that underage kids in [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1468.8799999999999s)]
*  it, and people knew that and a new stand continued to publish [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1471.9599999999998s)]
*  it, they would have liability for trafficking in child [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1475.72s)]
*  pornography or whatever it happens to be. And so the new [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1478.4399999999998s)]
*  stand does get some liability. So there's no again, no perfect [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1481.76s)]
*  analogies here. But I think [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1484.1999999999998s)]
*  that Facebook and all these other sites are trying to remove [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1486.1599999999999s)]
*  the child porn or whatever, I don't think much that gets [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1488.1599999999999s)]
*  through at all. You know, I think maybe you have a better [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1490.32s)]
*  argument. And there is the argument that people make is [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1493.4s)]
*  that because of the feed that they're making editorial [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1496.16s)]
*  judgments, and that's obviously not distributing. However, my [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1498.64s)]
*  counter arguments to that is that the feed just gives you [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1501.2800000000002s)]
*  more what you want. I mean, it just looks at what you're [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1503.52s)]
*  clicking on what you're viewing the time you're spending, and [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1505.3200000000002s)]
*  they just give you more of that. I don't think it's [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1507.6000000000001s)]
*  editorializing. Now, back to Jamal's point about this is the [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1509.4s)]
*  way things are headed, that may well be right, but I think we're [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1513.1200000000001s)]
*  going to regret it. I mean, first of all, the Democrats [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1516.16s)]
*  interest that one of their biggest donors is the trial [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1518.6000000000001s)]
*  lawyers bar and they generally will support any legislation [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1521.12s)]
*  that opens up the causes of actions. And that's where this [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1525.08s)]
*  is headed. And what's going to happen is if they get rid of [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1527.8799999999999s)]
*  section 230 is that every time there's an alleged harm that [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1530.76s)]
*  occurs every time a kid gets bullied or beat up in school, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1535.04s)]
*  every time something goes wrong in their life, they're going to [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1539.56s)]
*  try and in it on social media and try and show that they [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1542.1599999999999s)]
*  imbibe something on social media that led them down this dark [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1547.1999999999998s)]
*  path. And these types of companies are going to get sued [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1549.8s)]
*  in every jurisdiction in America. Recently, we've seen [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1553.72s)]
*  huge judgments related to defamation, where if you have [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1557.36s)]
*  say, a red politically red defendant in a blue [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1561.56s)]
*  jurisdiction, huge awards, I think we could probably see the [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1565.6399999999999s)]
*  opposite as well, that basically you'll start seeing blue [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1568.52s)]
*  defendants taken on in red jurisdictions, we've seen [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1571.12s)]
*  completely disproportionate judgments and again around [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1574.28s)]
*  defamation, disproportionate relative to the harm that was [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1577.72s)]
*  actually took place, you're going to see that on steroids if [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1580.52s)]
*  we get rid of section 230. Now, historically was the job of [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1583.4s)]
*  Republicans to oppose Democrats on this stuff, because they knew [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1587.1200000000001s)]
*  that Democrats were shilling for the plaintiffs bar. Republicans [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1590.84s)]
*  have not done that because they're so mad at these social [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1595.52s)]
*  media companies for censorship. So remember, when I talked [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1597.76s)]
*  about Good Samaritan liability, these companies created content [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1600.16s)]
*  moderation to basically try and remove the violent material, the [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1604.84s)]
*  pornographic material, the sexual material, the harassing [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1609.24s)]
*  material. But in the process of doing that, they started making [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1612.56s)]
*  political judgments, and they started engaging in political [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1616.48s)]
*  censorship. And that has made the Republicans so angry that [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1619.76s)]
*  they have now turned against these companies and they are [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1623.24s)]
*  willing to remove section 230. My point is, I think Republicans [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1626.08s)]
*  at the end, they are going to regret that because if you [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1629.36s)]
*  remove section 230, it's going to open up this flood of [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1631.28s)]
*  litigation, maybe a free for all, it'll be a free for all. And [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1634.44s)]
*  what's going to happen is that these companies, just driven by [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1637.56s)]
*  simple corporate risk aversion, are going to clamp down even [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1642.1200000000001s)]
*  more. I mean, the content moderation is going to be even [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1645.48s)]
*  stricter. And because the content moderators, these [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1648.3600000000001s)]
*  companies basically are liberals, if you empower them [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1651.0800000000002s)]
*  to take down even more content, they're going to take down [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1654.0800000000002s)]
*  Republican stuff even more. Very easy, it'll be very easy for the [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1657.0s)]
*  plaintiffs to target that type of content, they'll say that, oh, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1661.0s)]
*  that, you know, all of that Republican or conservative [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1664.88s)]
*  content that influenced people in a very negative direction, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1668.24s)]
*  that created all of these harms, there'll be lawsuits targeting [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1671.04s)]
*  that sort of content and Facebook and others will respond [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1674.4s)]
*  in the economically rational way, which is to shut it down [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1677.72s)]
*  completely. So I think senators like Josh Hawley are not going [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1680.4s)]
*  to get what they want. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1683.4s)]
*  They're not thinking straight. Yeah, Chamath is going to back [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1684.4s)]
*  fight. Yeah, it's going to backfire. Chamath. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1686.28s)]
*  The reason why this is going to happen, if it does happen, and [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1687.56s)]
*  you want to try to be probabilistic about it, is [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1692.24s)]
*  because when you look back at the tobacco settlement, the [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1694.96s)]
*  original settlement in today's dollars about $370 billion. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1697.36s)]
*  If you if you were the trial lawyers, and you're looking at a [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1701.92s)]
*  combination of Facebook and tik tok, and all of the all of that [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1705.2s)]
*  money, I suspect that they probably think that the [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1710.2s)]
*  potential that they can extract from these companies is going to [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1714.64s)]
*  be multiples of that number. And then as a result, their fees [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1718.88s)]
*  will be between 20 and 50% of that. So you're talking about [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1723.5600000000002s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue potential that will [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1727.5200000000002s)]
*  motivate, I think these folks to get the law changed. And then [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1735.88s)]
*  the byproduct will not be framed in terms of dollars. If these are [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1744.04s)]
*  highly kinetic issues, when you're talking about sexual [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1748.32s)]
*  exploitation, and young people and mental health and suicide and [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1751.1599999999999s)]
*  bullying, these are very kinetic issues, right. And so bringing [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1755.3999999999999s)]
*  these to jury trials all across the United States, I think that [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1758.68s)]
*  they probably think that they're on the right side of history and [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1762.84s)]
*  winning those things. So, you know, again, I'm not saying it's [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1766.68s)]
*  right. I'm not saying it's highly emotional. I mean, listen, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1769.72s)]
*  it's gonna be people's kids gonna win. You bring a case of [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1773.2s)]
*  say, teen suicide, okay. horrible that it happens. But [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1777.0800000000002s)]
*  there's gonna every time something like that happens, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1782.68s)]
*  there's going to be a huge temptation, I'm sure there'll be [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1784.76s)]
*  trial lawyers who specialize in this, to bring a case against [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1786.92s)]
*  Facebook or some other social media company. And they're going [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1790.88s)]
*  to scour through these accounts and try to point to examples [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1793.3600000000001s)]
*  that could have led to this result. And the truth of the [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1799.28s)]
*  matter is that maybe social media contributed a little but [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1801.84s)]
*  what about popular culture and popular entertainment? What about [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1805.0s)]
*  all the messages? I'm not debating any of that. I'm just [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1807.8s)]
*  I'm pointing out what's gonna happen. What about all the [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1810.76s)]
*  messages they received? Not not through the edge cases I got [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1813.12s)]
*  through on social media, but through the mainstream [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1816.8s)]
*  entertainment. I mean, all the shows are watching on television, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1818.52s)]
*  all the music they're listening to the things that happened in [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1821.12s)]
*  their schools, and day to day conversations with other kids. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1823.4399999999998s)]
*  But you can't really sue any of those other things. But you can [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1826.28s)]
*  sue social media. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1829.1399999999999s)]
*  The crazy thing about all of this is that all of these [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1830.72s)]
*  lawsuits are funded in part by these hedge funds who will do [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1834.18s)]
*  litigation finance. And part of putting together a well [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1837.64s)]
*  performing litigation finance fund is underwriting the [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1842.24s)]
*  probability of success. And I think when you flow through the [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1844.72s)]
*  probabilities, and you apply it to these companies, largely [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1847.96s)]
*  because of their profitability and their ability to over earn [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1851.96s)]
*  and generate profits, I suspect that Wall Street is probably [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1856.0s)]
*  already involved if and if not, they'll probably get involved [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1860.96s)]
*  in due course. But it's it's an unfortunate thing, David, I [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1864.36s)]
*  agree, because this is sort of like, hey, the rules on the [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1868.52s)]
*  field were X, and folks operated by those and they are clear, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1871.76s)]
*  they are trying to do their best. But again, this is where [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1875.36s)]
*  capitalism, the part of capitalism that can be awkward [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1877.92s)]
*  and uncomfortable is when industries over earned for long [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1880.36s)]
*  periods of time, other folks say, I'm going to compete away [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1884.36s)]
*  those returns somehow, and I want a share of those profits. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1887.1999999999998s)]
*  And I think that that's going to be the large motivator. And it's [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1889.8s)]
*  just going to result in I think, these things changing and a [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1893.0s)]
*  plethora of lawsuits. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1895.6s)]
*  And at the end of the day, this is about children and protecting [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1897.04s)]
*  children. So the obvious solution here is society has to [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1900.7199999999998s)]
*  come up with a number of sadly, I think that could be a [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1903.8999999999999s)]
*  veneer Jason, you know what I mean? Let me finish my thought [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1906.36s)]
*  here. The key thing is there's some age in which we all agree [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1909.08s)]
*  it's reasonable for kids to be using social media. And there's [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1913.0s)]
*  a certain age when we think it's not reasonable. And back to [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1915.36s)]
*  capitalism, I think a very good point you made your mouth. These [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1918.2s)]
*  companies are going to have to say, well, if we lose the 12 to [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1921.24s)]
*  15 year olds, is that better for society and better for our [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1924.1s)]
*  business. And we just all agree that social media should start [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1927.8s)]
*  at 15 or 16. And then the handset manufacturers and the [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1930.88s)]
*  social sites all have you have to get permission from your [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1934.96s)]
*  parents to use them period full stop. And that's it. And that [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1937.36s)]
*  may be where this all winds up, I think. And then also explain [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1940.12s)]
*  the algorithms, I think is the next thing that's going to [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1942.98s)]
*  happen, people are going to have to disclose how these algorithms [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1945.1s)]
*  work. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1947.5s)]
*  I think you're making a very good point, which is that is the [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1947.98s)]
*  right conversation to have. My point was that instead of having [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1950.26s)]
*  that conversation, which is more societal, it involves David's [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1953.38s)]
*  right parental responsibility, what is our role? Absolutely. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1957.26s)]
*  But being actively involved. And by the way, the trends around [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1960.38s)]
*  family formation, and the fact that there's way more single [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1963.94s)]
*  parent families make this problem even harder, because now [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1966.98s)]
*  there's only one person to check in and two people to check in. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1969.8600000000001s)]
*  So all these things societally build on itself, Jason, that is [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1973.14s)]
*  the absolute right conversation to have. My point is, that's not [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1976.22s)]
*  going to be why the rules need to get rewritten. The rules will [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1980.46s)]
*  get rewritten because there's an economic argument by a different [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1984.46s)]
*  sector of the economy, in this case, the trial lawyers and [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1987.66s)]
*  other folks that say there's a trillion dollars to be had if we [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1989.78s)]
*  get this law changed, they are motivated enough to do that. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1993.08s)]
*  Yeah, a parasitic sector. So there is a bill right now working [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1996.1s)]
*  its way through the California Assembly that would go to [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=1999.3s)]
*  Gavin Newsom that would prohibit the use of social media by under [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2002.06s)]
*  16 year olds. So that is actually happening. Yeah, I agree with [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2005.78s)]
*  you. That's a better debate to have than changing Section 230 in [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2010.5s)]
*  a way that's going to lead to more censorship. By the way, just [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2013.54s)]
*  just on that point. I think Republicans need to understand [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2015.54s)]
*  this in particular is that the anger towards these companies is [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2018.86s)]
*  bipartisan, the the outrage is bipartisan, the moral panic is [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2022.8999999999999s)]
*  bipartisan, you saw on in that hearing, you couldn't really [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2026.5s)]
*  tell the difference between Republicans and Democrats. Okay, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2029.3s)]
*  so I wouldn't be surprised if they agreed, like Chema said, on [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2032.1399999999999s)]
*  some sort of changes to Section 230. But here's the catch is that [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2037.86s)]
*  Republicans Democrats have fundamentally different [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2041.26s)]
*  objectives. Fundamentally, Democrats want there to be more [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2043.54s)]
*  censorship. They say this all the time. We want you taking down [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2046.82s)]
*  more content, not less. Republicans want there to be less [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2049.34s)]
*  censorship. Okay. So if they agree on the same piece of [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2052.1s)]
*  legislation, only one of them can be right. Okay. And the [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2055.7s)]
*  question is, who's gonna be right? My guess is that if [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2059.8599999999997s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans agree on a Section 230 modification, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2062.4199999999996s)]
*  the Democrats know what they're doing. And the Republicans, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2065.9399999999996s)]
*  generally being the stupid party who get outsmarted all the time [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2068.58s)]
*  by Democrats are going to agree to something that they later [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2070.98s)]
*  regret. So at the end of the day, I don't think that [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2073.3399999999997s)]
*  bipartisan legislation should be possible. The anger is bipartisan, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2077.02s)]
*  but the objectives are not. And if something gets through, it's [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2080.98s)]
*  going to be because Republicans make a huge mistake. And just to [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2084.1s)]
*  give a tangible example of this, okay, take the Second [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2086.74s)]

*  discussion where nobody would ever talk about the number of [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2164.06s)]
*  weeks. Like, that's at the core of the issue. We could agree on [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2166.06s)]

*  move forward on the docket here. We got so much to talk about. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2175.58s)]
*  And I think the number one story of the week was Elon's pay [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2178.06s)]
*  package and this ruling that occurred in Delaware. Let me [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2183.02s)]
*  just tee this up here. Many of you probably know about this [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2186.78s)]
*  already. But in 2018, Tesla's board approved a performance [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2189.34s)]
*  based compensation package for Elon was approved by 73% of [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2193.26s)]
*  shareholders. Elon and his brother Kimball would have put [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2197.82s)]
*  that at 80%. But they were excluded, obviously, this is [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2201.42s)]
*  lower than maybe some other support levels. According to [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2203.98s)]
*  Reuters, you typically see 95% for a executive compensation [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2208.1000000000004s)]
*  packet. But this one was very unique. It was all stock, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2212.86s)]
*  there's no cash bonus, no salary, 12 trillions of stock [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2215.5s)]
*  was very creative in how this was put together because Elon [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2218.46s)]
*  got nothing. If he doubled the value of Tesla, but then if he, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2221.1000000000004s)]
*  you know, increase the value of the top line revenue and the [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2226.2599999999998s)]
*  market cap increased by $50 billion, he got 1% more of the [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2230.06s)]
*  outstanding shares, which is an amazing help for shareholders, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2234.1s)]
*  obviously, because the market cap on the company went up 50 [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2237.7s)]
*  billion. The initial plan was only worth about 2.6 billion. But [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2240.34s)]
*  since Tesla crushed it from 2018 to 2023, we'll throw up a chart [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2245.06s)]
*  here. So in the great runs in the history of capitalism, how [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2248.46s)]
*  revenue and sales grew at this company. So it made it the [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2251.9s)]
*  largest common package in the history of public markets. And [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2255.5s)]
*  if you compare Tesla to Apple, the second highest increasing [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2258.26s)]
*  stock price during that same time period, Apple went up 345%. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2261.42s)]
*  That's the one up 800%. In 2018, a Tesla shareholder sued Elon [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2265.86s)]
*  and Tesla's board, claiming the pay package was unfair. The guy [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2269.66s)]
*  had nine shares, a full nine shares, not 109 worth $2,500. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2272.86s)]
*  His stake with 10x in those six years. So he made a fortune on [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2277.78s)]
*  that bet. And then on Tuesday, a Delaware judge voided Elon's pay [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2281.54s)]
*  package siding with the investor. Elon can appeal it to [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2284.74s)]
*  the Delaware Supreme Court. Sax, your thoughts on this ruling? I [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2290.02s)]
*  teed it up. I think I got all the details in there. If I missed [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2295.22s)]
*  any, please add them. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2297.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think in order to reach this ruling, the judge had to [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2299.1s)]
*  find three things and all of them had to be the case in her [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2302.3799999999997s)]
*  opinion. Number one, that the pay package was excessive. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2306.3399999999997s)]
*  Number two, that the process by which they came up with the pay [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2309.4199999999996s)]
*  package was not fair, meaning it was not sufficiently [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2312.74s)]
*  adversarial enough that the directors, in her opinion, had [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2315.8599999999997s)]
*  too many ties to Elon and didn't, again, take enough of a [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2319.9399999999996s)]
*  antagonistic role in negotiating that package. And number three, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2325.14s)]
*  and I think most importantly, that the shareholder vote was [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2330.8599999999997s)]
*  invalid. Because even if the first two had been true, the [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2333.8999999999996s)]
*  shareholders approved it. And that would have been good [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2336.58s)]
*  enough. But she said that the shareholders weren't sufficiently [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2338.62s)]
*  informed. And specifically, I think this argument hung on a few [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2341.98s)]
*  internal emails, where people said that they thought that they [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2345.42s)]
*  could hit the numbers. I think that of the three legs of this, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2348.7s)]
*  well, all three have been challenged by opponents of this [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2352.7400000000002s)]
*  verdict. I mean, number one, yes, the pay package ended up [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2356.02s)]
*  being a gargantuan amount, but you have to look at an ex ante, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2358.98s)]
*  not ex post. Nobody thought Elon could hit all these numbers. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2362.02s)]
*  Back at the time this package was negotiated. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2366.06s)]
*  Let's be frank, it was absurd. The idea that he would 10x it [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2368.66s)]
*  was [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2372.14s)]
*  crazy clip with Andrew Ross Orkin, where they're all [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2372.8199999999997s)]
*  laughing at the idea that he's going to hit these numbers. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2374.8599999999997s)]
*  Remember, this was at a time when he was going through was [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2377.22s)]
*  called production hell, where he was sleeping on the factory. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2379.42s)]
*  Yeah, I was there and come out yet and nobody nobody believed [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2382.2999999999997s)]
*  that the model three is going to be the hit that it was. In fact, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2386.02s)]
*  all the stories were pooh poohing that idea and basically [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2388.62s)]
*  saying that Tesla is basically screwed because they can't get [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2391.58s)]
*  the production line working correctly. Yeah, you want to [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2394.02s)]
*  play this test and now announcing a radical new [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2396.7s)]
*  compensation plan. It could be perhaps the most radical [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2399.7s)]
*  compensation plan in history. The executive will receive no [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2402.3799999999997s)]
*  guaranteed compensation of any time of any kind at all. He gets [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2406.14s)]
*  no salary cash bonus equity. He only gets equity that that vests [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2409.7799999999997s)]
*  over time, but only if he reaches these hurdle rates, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2413.8599999999997s)]
*  which are, dare I say crazy. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2417.46s)]
*  The only part of it that I think is really relevant is where [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2419.58s)]
*  Sorkin says that the milestones are crazy, meaning that [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2422.7s)]
*  everyone thought it was a pipe dream that the company would [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2426.98s)]
*  ever hit these numbers. Okay, so that's point number one on [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2430.2599999999998s)]
*  magnitude. On the second part of the ruling about the process, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2432.8599999999997s)]
*  it is true that like in most venture backed startups, there's [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2437.8999999999996s)]
*  a long standing relationship between the founder and the [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2442.5s)]
*  investors because they work collaboratively to try and make [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2445.3799999999997s)]
*  the company a success. There were emails that came out were [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2448.42s)]
*  Elon shows that I'm not trying to go for the maximum here. So, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2452.5s)]
*  you know, did the investors go in with a hostile antagonistic [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2456.34s)]
*  attitude that we're going to try and pay you the least? No. But [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2459.22s)]
*  did Elon go in with the attitude that I'm going to try and take [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2461.38s)]
*  the most? No, the email showed that. What they tried to do was [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2463.7s)]
*  come up with something that they thought was fair, that would [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2468.54s)]
*  fairly reward him for outsized performance. And if he had [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2471.38s)]
*  merely increased the value of Tesla from 59 billion to 100 [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2475.38s)]
*  billion, he would have gotten nothing. Let's just keep that in [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2480.74s)]
*  mind. So they tried to come up with something that would reward [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2482.9799999999996s)]
*  him for outsized performance and give him absolutely nothing for [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2485.74s)]
*  merely decent or good performance. The third point [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2488.7799999999997s)]
*  about the shareholder vote. I don't think that there was [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2492.7s)]
*  anything about the shareholder vote that the shareholders didn't [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2497.7799999999997s)]
*  know. I don't think that the company didn't release. Elon [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2500.22s)]
*  always said, yeah, we're going to do this. We're going to be [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2503.14s)]
*  one of the most valuable companies in the world. He's [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2504.9799999999996s)]
*  always been super optimistic about their ability to reach [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2506.7799999999997s)]
*  these targets. But if you looked at all the Wall Street analysts, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2509.9s)]
*  including Sorkin there, they thought that these targets were [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2512.9s)]
*  unreachable. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2517.78s)]
*  Also, to add to that, sex, this had the largest short position, I [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2518.94s)]
*  believe at that time of any company ever. People were [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2522.58s)]
*  betting with their dollars that this company was going to zero. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2526.2200000000003s)]
*  There were a ton of people who the narrative was this they'll [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2529.26s)]
*  never deliver the Model Three, it was two years late, right, or [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2532.14s)]
*  something in that range. It was, they kept trying to get the [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2534.82s)]
*  Model Three out. It was taking forever. So yeah, it's absurd. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2537.58s)]
*  Also, in that case, Sorkin said in that same clip, there's been a [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2541.58s)]
*  lot of speculation of stepping down after the Model Three is in [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2543.94s)]
*  production in the judges ruling. She said the exact opposite. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2547.38s)]
*  There is no reason to leave on leave, except that he was [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2549.74s)]
*  running like two or three other companies, it was actually quite [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2552.74s)]
*  possible that he would leave. He never wanted to be CEO of Tesla. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2555.86s)]
*  People forget that too. He had tried three CEOs of Tesla, and [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2558.94s)]
*  he only took over Tesla. And I remember it was because he said, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2562.1s)]
*  Jason, this thing's gonna fail if I don't take it over. He tried [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2566.18s)]
*  three different CEO CEOs in the beginning, people forget that [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2568.98s)]
*  fact. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2571.82s)]
*  And there was scuttlebutt that he would hire somebody I remember [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2573.42s)]
*  there was like rumors about Sheryl Sandberg maybe getting off [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2575.94s)]
*  the job or something like that. I remember he was he was going [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2578.38s)]
*  through production now he was sleeping on the factory floor. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2581.7s)]
*  Yeah. And he was talking in interviews about how miserable [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2584.14s)]
*  his life was at that time. I mean, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2586.54s)]
*  can confirm. Yeah, exactly. So look, did he have leverage to [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2587.94s)]
*  basically say, you know what, let's just hire a CEO. Yeah, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2591.42s)]
*  absolutely. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2593.5s)]
*  Okay, Shamath, any steelman you can do it the other side here, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2595.02s)]
*  like as an investor, public market investor, sometimes. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2598.54s)]
*  When you saw that pay package, what did you think? I don't know [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2602.4199999999996s)]
*  if you were a shareholder of Tesla at the time or not. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2605.74s)]
*  In the mid teens, I started investing in public stocks, as [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2607.62s)]
*  well as private tech companies. And I got invited to give a [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2614.18s)]
*  presentation at the iris own conference, which is like the [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2618.58s)]
*  most prestigious conference of public market investors you in [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2621.38s)]
*  May, you show up at Lincoln Center. And everybody in the [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2625.42s)]
*  audience is paying like 10,000 bucks a ticket or something. And [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2629.58s)]
*  all the proceeds go to a foundation in support of this [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2632.1s)]
*  gentleman, Iris own who passed away. But in any event, it's [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2636.26s)]
*  like, Ackman, Tapper, Einhorn, and I picked Tesla, and I was a [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2638.7000000000003s)]
*  very big supporter in many ways and still am. And I think that I [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2645.66s)]
*  knew the company, frankly, better than most people, except [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2652.2599999999998s)]
*  for him, obviously. But I think that I studied this company [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2655.5s)]
*  quite deeply. When I and I'm just setting the context. When I [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2658.62s)]
*  saw the pay package, I thought, he's making a mistake. This is [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2661.98s)]
*  unachievable. I thought the probabilities were in the low [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2667.58s)]
*  single digits. And then he did it, which just kinds of shows [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2671.46s)]
*  how incredibly adept he is as a CEO and a manager and an [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2677.54s)]
*  executer. So then, you know, to go back five or six years later, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2684.66s)]
*  after he actually does something that so massively [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2689.7s)]
*  disproportionately positively impacted investors, and then to [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2694.46s)]
*  just rescind it and unwind it, I think is really un-American and [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2699.9s)]
*  unfair. And I think it sets a very poor standard for why [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2704.1800000000003s)]
*  anybody should actually build a company governed in Delaware. It [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2709.14s)]
*  makes no sense anymore. And just to give you that example, he and [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2712.6600000000003s)]
*  I have both now done this, but like these incremental companies [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2716.86s)]
*  that I've started are in Nevada, they're in different places, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2719.54s)]
*  because I find the Delaware court slightly and increasingly [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2722.94s)]
*  unpredictable, and acting with other mandates that they weren't [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2727.54s)]
*  ever given. So you [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2731.66s)]
*  What do you think that mandate is? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2733.2999999999997s)]
*  you had a place where there was highly predictable governance, and [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2735.3399999999997s)]
*  they had very narrow ways in which they would act and opine. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2740.22s)]
*  And I think in a situation like this, where you had every [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2745.98s)]
*  opportunity to actually vote this thing down, and what little of [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2749.98s)]
*  the documentation that I saw about the communication back and [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2755.38s)]
*  forth doesn't seem to support this theory that he rammed it [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2758.1800000000003s)]
*  through. Nobody rams anything through over nine months where he [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2761.7400000000002s)]
*  takes month long breaks and he tells the GC this is actually [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2765.6600000000003s)]
*  more than I wanted. Nobody does that if you're right. It's the [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2769.62s)]
*  opposite of ramming something through. And I suspect if you [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2772.82s)]
*  really asked him and I haven't, but I would, he probably [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2776.86s)]
*  thought it was like largely crazy. And so I think a lot of [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2780.6600000000003s)]
*  people thought that we that we were as shareholders, and I'll [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2784.74s)]
*  tell you that I felt this way, getting his hard work, and that [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2788.3399999999997s)]
*  he may have just mathematically been mistaken. So yes, he got [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2792.3399999999997s)]
*  55 or that packages are at 55.8 billion. But you're missing the [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2795.8199999999997s)]
*  point where every other investor made $500 billion. Right? Yeah, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2800.8999999999996s)]
*  the investors, investors did approve it, it will have a [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2806.1s)]
*  chilling effect, I think, and how people think about [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2808.9799999999996s)]
*  compensation, it will cause companies to be even more [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2811.18s)]
*  constipated and sclerotic, and unimaginative as a result of [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2815.14s)]
*  this, because the most talented individual entrepreneurs now [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2820.5s)]
*  have even more of an incentive for incorporating in other [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2825.3399999999997s)]
*  places, and also staying private. And I think what that [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2828.8999999999996s)]
*  deprives is the broader shareholders, including this [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2832.94s)]
*  gentleman, look, we live in America, he had the right to sue, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2837.2999999999997s)]
*  he had nine shares, and he was able to bring this lawsuit nine [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2840.82s)]
*  shares. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2844.86s)]
*  I mean, David Elias, yeah, I mean, the idea that nine shares [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2846.42s)]
*  are 10x their money, but what he does is, but you know, I don't [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2849.7400000000002s)]
*  know if he remained a shareholder through this whole [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2853.6200000000003s)]
*  period, but even those nine shares, 10x in value. Yes, yes. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2855.34s)]
*  But he would now be deprived of that in this next iteration of [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2861.7000000000003s)]
*  Elon Musk's, because why would they ever go through this to put [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2866.2200000000003s)]
*  that much work into something to be so at risk personally, your [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2869.26s)]
*  own mental and physical health, we saw him in those periods. And [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2874.98s)]
*  then to have it taken away, I think is deeply, deeply unfair. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2879.1800000000003s)]
*  Sax. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2882.82s)]
*  You're right, this this deal was a win win. I mean, if Elon could [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2883.38s)]
*  achieve these numbers, it was good for him. And it was great [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2887.3s)]
*  for shareholders. And that's why I think the key point is that [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2890.6200000000003s)]
*  73 or 80%, depending on how you want to count it, approved this [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2894.0600000000004s)]
*  deal. I think they knew everything relevant that they [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2897.58s)]
*  needed to know when they approved it. This is the deal [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2900.54s)]
*  that most shareholders in most companies would want for the [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2903.74s)]
*  CEO. The deal is you get nothing unless you deliver an outsized [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2907.38s)]
*  return for shareholders. Most CEOs won't sign up for this [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2912.58s)]
*  deal. Most CEOs work their way up through the corporate ladder, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2915.7s)]
*  they get into the CEO chair, and then they pay themselves huge [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2919.22s)]
*  amounts of money regards to whether the company succeeds or [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2921.86s)]
*  fails. And that's the deal they want because they don't really [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2924.38s)]
*  have confidence in themselves to deliver what Sorkin called the [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2927.62s)]
*  crazy outcome. Elon had the confidence in himself to deliver [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2932.62s)]
*  the crazy outcome. And nobody was really complaining about [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2936.3s)]
*  this until like you said, this small shareholder, who's really [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2939.38s)]
*  basically just, you know, a name plaintiff for the trial lawyers [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2943.42s)]
*  bar somebody who wants to get Elon to bring the suit. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2947.58s)]
*  6% to create 600 billion in value. I mean, it's quite a [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2952.3s)]
*  bargain, folks. And I think if you went to Ford or GM and said, [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2956.9s)]
*  Hey, would you like Elon to be your CEO? I think that often [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2960.5s)]
*  half the company [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2963.1800000000003s)]
*  Mary Barrett doesn't want this deal. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2963.86s)]
*  Yeah, no, J Cal Saks said something really important that [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2965.6200000000003s)]
*  you just mentioned as well, which is that if you actually [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2968.26s)]
*  look at the average compensation plan of most public company [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2970.7400000000002s)]
*  CEOs, it actually is very much counter to shareholder value. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2974.1800000000003s)]
*  I'll give you one simple example. If you look at the [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2979.06s)]
*  number of CEO comp packages that are tied to earnings per share [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2981.9s)]
*  growth. But then if you actually look at how these CEOs achieve [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2985.58s)]
*  their EPS targets, they do it by raising debt. So in debting the [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2989.62s)]
*  company, right, increasing the enterprise value by by loading [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2994.3s)]
*  the company up with debt, and then driving repurchase plans. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=2997.98s)]
*  And what what do those do? I mean, look, if you look at [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3001.58s)]

*  think it will have a ripple effect across how so many other [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3058.1s)]

*  think about risk. No CEO, as sac said, will ever want an [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3065.46s)]

*  canceled. So they will want something that is totally [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3076.1s)]
*  gameable. Right? Where you'll have 90 plus percent support and [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3080.3799999999997s)]
*  approval, because of how vanilla and benign it is on the surface. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3085.66s)]
*  But it will actually be quite a terrible plan underneath the [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3090.74s)]
*  surface. And what I mean specifically are these EPS [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3093.98s)]
*  targets for CEOs. So Elon did the one thing that was crazy, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3096.9s)]
*  which was I'm just going to do it based on pure profitability [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3100.74s)]
*  and performance. And he gets punished. And all these CEOs in [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3103.66s)]
*  this other class who are like, let me saddle these companies [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3108.18s)]
*  with debt that actually undermine shareholders have been [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3110.46s)]
*  rewarded. There is already a mechanism for somebody who [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3114.02s)]
*  disagrees with the compact. This person who on the man shares [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3116.9s)]
*  could have sold their shares, it's a liquid market at any [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3119.46s)]

*  I'm taking my nine shares in $2,500. I'm going to put it in [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3124.46s)]

*  He's not victim. He could have sold the shares and bought other [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3138.1s)]
*  shares and he's not a victim because he 10x to shares and [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3140.26s)]
*  beat the market. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3142.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, I don't place the blame on the [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3142.9s)]
*  shareholder per se, because this is really about a judge's [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3147.1s)]
*  interpretation of Delaware law and what companies are allowed [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3151.34s)]
*  to do. So whether the shareholder was harmed or not or [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3153.7s)]
*  had one share or million shares, that's just the way that this [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3157.9s)]
*  case gets into court. The question is the interpretation [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3161.2999999999997s)]
*  of Delaware law. And again, the part of this I would go back to [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3163.82s)]
*  that that I think was the mistake is that I think the [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3166.7799999999997s)]
*  shareholder vote was valid. I think the process was valid as [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3169.5s)]
*  well. I don't know that the process has to be this extremely [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3173.94s)]
*  adversarial process where one side pulling for the most one [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3178.1s)]
*  side's pulling for the least. I don't think either side operated [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3180.7000000000003s)]
*  that way. But again, I think shareholders knew what they [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3183.3s)]
*  needed to know. And the evidence of that is, in all of the public [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3185.62s)]
*  coverage at that time, nobody thought he was getting a good [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3189.38s)]
*  deal. Right? No one thought he was getting successfully good. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3192.94s)]
*  They thought he was getting a delusional deal meaning [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3196.14s)]
*  delusional for him. And everybody seemed to be okay with [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3200.06s)]
*  the idea that if somehow Elon could pull off this miracle, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3204.58s)]
*  that he would be entitled to this compensation and he would [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3208.42s)]
*  get nothing if he didn't. Now, again, I would go back to do you [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3210.9s)]
*  think Mary Barrow would have wanted this deal? While Elon was [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3215.14s)]
*  spending the last five, six years making Tesla go 10x. Let's [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3219.74s)]
*  look at GM. GM stock price was trading more or less in a flat [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3224.2599999999998s)]
*  range. I don't even think the share price doubled. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3229.58s)]
*  Yeah, put compare it to you see the compare to button there put [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3233.7799999999997s)]
*  compare to and then put Tesla in there. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3236.46s)]
*  Right. So if Mary Barrow GM had signed up for that comp package, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3238.14s)]
*  she would have gotten absolutely nothing, which is why I'm sure [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3240.9s)]
*  that the thought never even crossed her mind of having an all [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3243.86s)]
*  incentive based comp package that doesn't even start until you [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3246.74s)]
*  at least double the value of the company. By the way, on those [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3250.46s)]
*  milestones, it wasn't just the share price, it was share price [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3253.22s)]
*  and revenue or profit targets being met. So in other words, if [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3258.46s)]
*  the stock just rally because of macroeconomic conditions, like [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3262.46s)]
*  for example, interest rates go down, and then all of a sudden, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3266.38s)]
*  the whole stock market goes up, that was not good enough. It was [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3268.82s)]
*  also tied to the combination of stock value increases with [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3272.1s)]
*  revenue and profit targets being met. It was a compact is that [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3278.2200000000003s)]
*  couldn't be gamed. I mean, you have to hit the numbers in order [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3281.34s)]
*  to get the compact is that's what she got. And I don't want to [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3284.34s)]
*  pick too much on Mary Barrow here, I guess I'm picking her [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3287.14s)]
*  out because Joe Biden said that she created the EV revolution. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3290.22s)]
*  Yeah, well done. They've sold 17 cars. They canceled the car. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3294.54s)]
*  Yeah, there was there was a remarkable article in the Wall [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3299.46s)]
*  Street Journal just in December, where they finally admitted that [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3302.98s)]
*  this whole idea that GM had been leading any kind of revolution [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3306.9s)]
*  or had been a transformational company was revealed as [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3311.02s)]
*  basically a ruse. But look, you have to wonder how much of this [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3313.26s)]
*  is political. I mean, Delaware is Joe Biden's state. He's the [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3318.38s)]
*  Senator. There were articles describing how this judge was [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3322.34s)]
*  connected to a law firm that had helped Joe Biden get elected. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3327.9s)]
*  And you just kind of wonder whether Biden's directive from [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3332.1400000000003s)]
*  the White House podium that we got to get this guy, we got to [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3336.9s)]
*  look into this guy that he's an enemy, which has been [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3339.42s)]
*  reflected through all these different administrative [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3342.86s)]
*  agencies, sudden actions against Elon's companies for the glass [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3345.1400000000003s)]
*  house, Starlink and the FCC. Yeah, there's been a whole bunch [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3349.3s)]
*  of these issues. And you just wonder is this another [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3353.54s)]
*  manifestation of that? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3356.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the conspiracy theories are quickly coming [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3358.54s)]
*  closer to reality. And we definitely need to investigate [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3364.26s)]
*  that for sure. Because the FCC thing is crazy. Spending $15,000 [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3367.34s)]
*  putting fiber into people's homes when you could spend $1,500 [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3371.94s)]
*  giving them Starlink makes no sense. And the same people who [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3375.38s)]
*  have to wait for fiber, talk about this in a previous [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3377.62s)]
*  episode, they're gonna get Starlink anyway, they're gonna [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3380.2200000000003s)]
*  buy Starlink while they're waiting for the government fiber [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3382.9s)]
*  for 10 years. It's absurd. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3385.14s)]
*  I do want to uplevel this just back to what I was saying. And [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3387.1s)]
*  I'll try to I'll try to make the point better. I think I think [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3389.82s)]
*  it's really, really unfair. What's happening to Elon, but I [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3392.98s)]
*  want to take a step back and think about just the bigger [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3397.9s)]
*  picture. If we want an economy of vibrant companies that do [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3401.58s)]
*  great things, we're going to need to reward people to work [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3407.54s)]
*  at those companies. And in order for the United States to sort [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3411.02s)]
*  of continue to exert some amount of dominance in the areas that [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3416.38s)]
*  we think are important, we need to be economically vibrant, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3420.8199999999997s)]
*  right? And fair, and fair. And the problem is that this really [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3423.98s)]
*  perverts incentives, and it's going to exacerbate a trend that [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3427.18s)]
*  I think has actually held a bunch of our companies back. So [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3431.1s)]
*  the first thing I just wanted to show you guys was just this [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3434.66s)]
*  little thing that it's just a pie chart that shows, okay, how [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3436.7s)]
*  do CEOs get paid, right? So we want CEOs to go and run really [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3440.86s)]
*  important companies. Right? We want those companies to do great [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3446.22s)]
*  things in the world. We want these CEOs to be deeply motivated [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3450.3399999999997s)]
*  to go and push the boundaries of what's possible, right? We want [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3453.7799999999997s)]
*  all that. And so we want to compensate them to do those [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3457.18s)]
*  things. This is just a representation of how CEOs have [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3459.38s)]
*  structured their pay packages. And you'd say, Wow, all of these [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3462.58s)]
*  numbers seem reasonable. Return on capital, total shareholder [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3466.3s)]
*  return earnings per share. So what you need to do then is [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3469.7000000000003s)]
*  double click into this, right? So this is how CEO pay packages [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3472.98s)]
*  are made. But the problem is, and Jason, this is my problem [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3478.02s)]
*  with a bunch of these companies that all the returns all that [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3481.3s)]
*  shareholder return that you saw the return, it's all driven by [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3485.02s)]
*  share buybacks. Yep, this is an artificial gamesmanship of [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3488.42s)]
*  performance. This is not companies pushing the boundaries, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3492.5s)]
*  you know, this is not Disney figuring out it's not [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3495.7400000000002s)]
*  innovation. This is this is not M&A. This is Disney creating [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3498.42s)]
*  footfalls and falling into potholes of their own making. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3502.14s)]
*  But you can drive great compensation because you can [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3505.54s)]
*  game the way that you are paid. This doesn't make America great. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3508.7000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't create American exceptionalism. In fact, it just [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3514.38s)]
*  creates a bunch of financial engineering that results in [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3517.46s)]
*  marginal companies. And David just gave an example of one that [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3522.62s)]
*  could be considered that. So the point is that when you have one [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3525.98s)]
*  person that tries to buck this trend, I just think it has a [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3529.5s)]
*  huge impact by basically saying, hey, play the game like [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3534.3s)]
*  everybody else. Just game it just dial it in from your [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3539.5s)]
*  country club. Make sure that you become a member of Augusta. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3543.2200000000003s)]
*  That's more important to us than actually sleeping on the [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3546.7s)]
*  factory floor. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3549.3s)]
*  And don't take risk. I mean, if you think about what do you do if [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3550.58s)]
*  you're Apple, you're Google, you're Microsoft, you're sitting [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3553.5s)]
*  on tons of cash. It's a safe thing to do. You see what they [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3555.94s)]
*  do. You just buy back the shares. You can't do M&A. You [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3559.42s)]
*  issue debt. Yes. And then you buy back the shoes arbitrage, you [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3563.46s)]
*  encumber the shareholders with debt. And then you artificially [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3567.54s)]
*  inflate total shareholder return and earnings per share and the [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3572.34s)]
*  return on invested capital, because of how we can play these [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3575.9s)]
*  games in America. So right now what we are doing is we are not [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3579.2200000000003s)]
*  motivating CEOs to run great companies, we're motivating CEOs [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3582.86s)]
*  to understand financial arbitrage, the result will be [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3588.2200000000003s)]
*  crappier companies that diminish American exceptionalism. That is [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3592.1s)]
*  the only outcome. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3596.54s)]
*  Perfect. We said and there really are two caveats there. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3597.9s)]
*  Number one, we have to let M&A occur as well, because that's a [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3600.14s)]
*  better thing to do in some cases with this with this excess [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3603.1s)]
*  capital profits people have sitting there. And the only time [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3606.38s)]
*  really to buy shares back is when you think they're under [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3609.1s)]
*  value, you would agree. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3611.1s)]
*  Well, to your point, I actually think you're absolutely right. If [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3612.06s)]
*  you have a bunch of CEOs that don't know what they're doing, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3614.54s)]
*  which is what these charts kind of show, let them buy whatever [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3616.54s)]
*  they want, because you're going to screw it up. And that's fine [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3619.02s)]
*  for us anyways. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3621.1s)]
*  It's great for fluid marketplace. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3622.5s)]
*  The CEO that you don't want to have be able to buy companies is [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3624.9s)]
*  the actually motivated one to get paid when things go really [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3628.38s)]
*  well and to be you know, more profitable. So that would be the [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3632.58s)]
*  CEO where you would be scared. Oh my gosh, more M&A for that [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3635.7799999999997s)]
*  person may be bad. Yes. But more M&A for these CEOs is who cares? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3638.46s)]
*  Yeah, Microsoft starts buying a bunch of stuff. Google starts [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3642.7799999999997s)]
*  buying stuff at their primes. Man, that's scary, right? When [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3645.2999999999997s)]
*  Bill Gates went on a heater, he bought, I think he bought [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3647.86s)]
*  PowerPoint, a bunch of these suite was bought, not created. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3651.86s)]
*  And then Google and Facebook, man, they went on heaters, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3654.58s)]
*  YouTube, Instagram, WhatsApp, and that was the golden age of [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3657.1s)]
*  M&A. All right, we got a couple more things on the docket. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3660.34s)]
*  I want to cash them. I just found these stats. Go ahead, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3662.14s)]
*  Sachs. Great conversation. So just while we were talking, I [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3664.7s)]
*  just looked up what Mary Barra's compensation was over the past [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3667.42s)]
*  several years. And according to this source, she was paid $167 [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3671.8199999999997s)]
*  million for four years. So while Elon got zero, thanks to the [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3677.3399999999997s)]
*  judge's decision, Mary Barra, basically, if you add in [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3681.2599999999998s)]
*  probably the fifth year, let's call it roughly $200 million of [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3684.22s)]
*  compensation over the last five years. Now look at the stock [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3687.02s)]
*  chart of GM. Literally, this it is the same price today as it [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3690.86s)]
*  was five years ago. It's $38 a share today. It was $38 a share [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3695.98s)]
*  five years ago. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3700.58s)]
*  No, but it's worse. It's probably worse because they've [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3701.34s)]
*  issued options since then. So there's dilution you have to [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3703.38s)]
*  take in. So it's worse than that, actually. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3705.6200000000003s)]
*  But at best, the stock price is flat. And the stock basically [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3707.94s)]
*  fluctuated in line with market trends. When there was an asset [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3712.54s)]
*  bubble in 2021, the share price went up about 50%. And she got [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3716.14s)]
*  even more stock and options during that time. But it was it [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3721.8199999999997s)]
*  was a no lose proposition. Basically, she got paid regardless [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3725.7799999999997s)]
*  of how the stock did. And then when there was simply market [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3728.66s)]
*  volatility, she did even better. One of the nice things about [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3731.3399999999997s)]
*  Elon's package is that unless Tesla at least doubled in value, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3734.2599999999998s)]
*  he would get nothing. And it was tied to milestones around [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3738.74s)]
*  revenue and profit. So he couldn't just ride market [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3742.2999999999997s)]
*  volatility. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3745.02s)]
*  To getting more comp. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3746.42s)]
*  If you gave this executive the same deal, as Elon, she would [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3747.7000000000003s)]
*  have had to doubled 38. So you know, she would have had to get [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3751.5s)]
*  to $76. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3754.78s)]
*  $80 bucks to share before she got anything. I bet you if she [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3756.34s)]
*  got zero, she got paid $1 in her health care, and she had to get [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3761.9s)]
*  $80 share. I bet you that would be an $80 stock price. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3765.1000000000004s)]
*  Well, I don't I don't know if she has the ability to engineer [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3767.98s)]
*  that outcome. But I doubt [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3771.98s)]
*  so she's saying she's unqualified. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3774.66s)]
*  No, well, the Wall Street Journal said it. The Wall Street [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3777.02s)]
*  Journal just had this 10 year [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3779.06s)]
*  No, that's my point. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3780.62s)]
*  where they said that she failed. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3781.7s)]
*  They they're they're hiding the importance and yeah, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3783.8199999999997s)]
*  well, look, I mean, I don't want to say she's incompetent. I just [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3786.66s)]
*  want to say that the stock price is the same. The Wall Street [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3788.94s)]
*  Journal had an article talking about swept to transfer all of [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3791.2599999999998s)]
*  our transformation missions have failed. She swept roughly 200 [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3794.3399999999997s)]
*  million over just the last five years. I think she's been there. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3797.22s)]
*  How are she in charge? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3799.8199999999997s)]
*  She's probably made several hundred million dollars. And the [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3800.9s)]
*  company hasn't created any value for shareholders. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3805.1s)]
*  So how is she still in charge? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3807.42s)]
*  Just Jason, this is the way the fortune 500 works. It's a [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3809.02s)]
*  country club. Okay. Who gets appointed to these companies? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3811.58s)]
*  These companies are not run by founders. They're not even run by [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3816.86s)]
*  VCs or serious skin of the game. The kind of directors that this [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3820.46s)]

*  They basically are on other boards. And it's basically a [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3827.26s)]

*  someone who's politically savvy, who's worked their way up through [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3835.1400000000003s)]

*  women have been admitted to this country club. It is still a [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3854.62s)]

*  basically a collection of people who don't create any value, but [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3861.62s)]
*  pay themselves enormous amounts of money, hobnob with the right [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3864.54s)]

*  I think the common through line in these two conversations we've [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3876.8599999999997s)]
*  had this morning is about just how capitalism can be perverted, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3880.02s)]
*  if you will, by a small group of actors. In the first example, I [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3886.86s)]
*  think what we were talking about is the trial lawyers association [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3891.9s)]

*  happen around section 230. And in this example, I think what it [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3899.22s)]
*  speaks to is the influence that a small group of consultants can [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3902.82s)]
*  have in having built a very thriving business in designing [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3906.94s)]
*  these compensation plans for CEOs. And it reminds me of a of a [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3911.02s)]
*  clip of Buffett and Munger. And Nick, if you just want to play it, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3914.62s)]
*  I think they say it in very clear, plain English and not to [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3919.14s)]
*  debate their opinion, just to state it, but Nick, if you want [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3922.1s)]
*  to play it, we do not bring in compensation consultants, we [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3924.1s)]
*  don't have a human relations department, then we don't have [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3927.2200000000003s)]
*  it. We don't have headquarters, as you can see, we don't have any [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3929.7000000000003s)]
*  human relations department, we don't have a legal department, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3932.26s)]
*  we don't have a public relations department, we don't have an [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3934.18s)]
*  investor relations department, we don't have those things. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3936.1s)]
*  Because they make life way more complicated. And everybody gets [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3939.8199999999997s)]
*  a vested interest in going to conferences and calling in [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3942.74s)]
*  other consultants and it takes on a life of its own. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3945.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, I would rather throw a viper down my shirt front than [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3948.42s)]
*  hire a compensation consultant. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3952.54s)]
*  Tell me which kind of consultants you actually like [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3960.14s)]
*  Charlie. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3962.14s)]
*  Oh, man, Waldorf and Stadler, you know, from the Muppets, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3962.5s)]
*  sacks, Stadler, Waldorf, Larry's. Yeah, well, you [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3968.1s)]
*  mentioned grumpy, you mentioned this is a problem in capitalism. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3973.22s)]
*  I think there's two kinds of capitalism. Broadly speaking, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3976.66s)]
*  there's crony capitalism, and there's risk capitalism. Risk [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3979.46s)]
*  capitalism is the founder who starts with nothing but an idea, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3982.58s)]
*  along with the investors who are willing to write a check, knowing [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3986.54s)]
*  that nine times out of 10, it's going to be a zero. But maybe in [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3991.74s)]
*  that one out of 10 chance, it's going to be an outsized return. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3995.58s)]
*  That is true risk capitalism. Everyone has skin in the game. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=3998.74s)]
*  They work together, entrepreneur board members to try and create [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4001.22s)]
*  a great outcome. And they work out an arrangement where [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4004.94s)]
*  everyone benefits. It's a win win situation. Okay, that is risk [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4009.22s)]
*  capitalism. That's the part of our economy that drives all the [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4012.7799999999997s)]
*  innovation, all the progress of the job creation. Then you got [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4016.2599999999998s)]
*  crony capitalism, you got these companies that have been around [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4019.7s)]
*  for 100 years, the value was created by people long dead. And [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4022.54s)]
*  it is now managed by both directors and professional [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4026.7799999999997s)]
*  managers who work their way up through they go to like the [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4030.2599999999998s)]
*  right business schools, and they join the right organizations, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4033.3399999999997s)]
*  they donate the right politicians. And they somehow [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4036.3399999999997s)]
*  engineer a situation where they get in control. And then they [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4040.7799999999997s)]
*  pay themselves as much comp as they can possibly justify, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4043.7s)]
*  whether or not they create any value for the shareholder. That's [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4047.38s)]
*  what we saw at GM. And that's crony capitalism. And you know, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4050.1s)]
*  while they're doing it, the president's son is probably [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4054.5s)]
*  going to figure out a way to take a nice big chunk out of it [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4057.46s)]
*  too. Okay, oh, that's that's the system that we have the great [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4059.58s)]
*  here we go. Now, which of these two systems receives the brunt of [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4064.2200000000003s)]
*  the criticism by the mainstream media, who is attacked? And who [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4070.66s)]
*  is celebrated? Okay, there we go. There's your red grade [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4075.18s)]
*  point. I've seen a zillion attacks on Elon Musk. I saw one [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4079.8199999999997s)]
*  article pointing out that all of Mary Barrett's transformation [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4083.62s)]
*  General Motors was a failure, created no value for [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4087.18s)]
*  shareholders. And the whole thing was basically a fraud. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4089.74s)]
*  But how's the union doing? And how did the union one article? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4092.54s)]
*  And I'm frankly shocked that the Wall Street Journal even ran [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4095.2599999999998s)]
*  that article. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4098.34s)]
*  Yeah, okay. Yeah. And how did the union do? And who did the [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4099.22s)]
*  union get behind and vote for? Yeah, let's maybe double click [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4102.34s)]
*  on a couple items. Let's see. All right, let's I want to go [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4104.94s)]
*  over one more thing where we're cooking with oil here. And I [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4107.379999999999s)]
*  just wanted to talk a little bit about if he was possibly coming [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4109.7s)]
*  back, I just interviewed Alexis Ohanian, the founder of Reddit, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4113.099999999999s)]
*  which according to Bloomberg, they've been advised by [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4116.379999999999s)]
*  potential IPO investors to target a $5 billion valuation, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4119.9s)]
*  they're going to go public possibly in March, which is [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4123.339999999999s)]
*  wild. That's only a couple weeks away. In peak Zerp, Reddit had [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4125.82s)]
*  raised that a $10 billion valuation that was back in 2021. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4129.7s)]
*  They were valued in 15 billion in the secondary market. That's [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4133.5s)]
*  where people like previous employees, angel investors, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4136.34s)]
*  etc. might trade their shares. And so if it goes out of five, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4139.099999999999s)]
*  it's going to be between a 50% to their tear cut. And it is [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4144.219999999999s)]
*  trading at 4.5 billion. Chamath, we talked about this a [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4148.82s)]
*  bunch, the down run IPOs, Instacart, I think, being the [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4152.0599999999995s)]
*  best example, they got out, but they've been hovering at a really [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4155.98s)]
*  low number for a long time. And people have been talking about [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4160.34s)]
*  them possibly being a takeout candidate by Doordash or Amazon [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4162.9400000000005s)]
*  or Uber. So your thoughts on the Reddit IPO news? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4166.38s)]
*  I think that if I had to price the IPO, I would be modeling two [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4170.54s)]
*  important levers in the business. The first is, what is [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4177.22s)]
*  the actual attainable revenue from my audience? And so what is [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4180.5s)]
*  the ARPU of the average Reddit user? And you can model it as a [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4187.38s)]
*  distribution. And I think Facebook has the best data [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4193.66s)]
*  because they've been publishing it in their quarterly returns [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4196.06s)]
*  for a very long time now for over a decade, which is there is [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4199.02s)]
*  a distribution of value of a Facebook user economically, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4202.78s)]
*  right? At the upper end, you have the folks that are on [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4206.34s)]
*  Facebook proper in America, in a certain age band in certain [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4208.900000000001s)]
*  states that are probably like 30, 40, $50 ARPUs, all the way [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4213.82s)]
*  down to in developing countries, those users are worth low single [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4217.7s)]
*  digit dollars economically. And I think that people will have to [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4222.62s)]
*  very much understand what is the average Reddit user? And what is [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4227.42s)]
*  the distribution of economic value that they represent? [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4231.9s)]
*  That's the first thing. And I think that that's really the [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4235.219999999999s)]
*  thing that will determine whether it's worth 5 billion or 10 [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4237.34s)]
*  billion or frankly, 2 billion. And then the second key lever, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4240.1s)]
*  it will be the risk factors in the IPO, because where the [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4244.780000000001s)]
*  shareholder lawsuits will come from, which will really dictate [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4249.22s)]
*  if the how the hedge fund community buys this thing is [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4254.22s)]
*  going to be the potential for my ad ran against content that is [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4258.22s)]
*  deeply offensive to me that whole construct. And I think [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4263.3s)]
*  that they are going to have to very carefully ring fence that [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4267.7s)]
*  liability to get this IPO to be successful, but also for them to [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4271.26s)]
*  execute a scaled ad revenue business. And not spending enough [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4275.66s)]
*  time on Reddit, I don't know how bad of a problem this is. I don't [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4282.099999999999s)]
*  think it's for Chan or a Chan as an example. But I also don't [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4286.82s)]
*  think it's Facebook and Instagram. And so it's kind of [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4290.34s)]
*  somewhere in the middle. And I think that those risks are really [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4292.82s)]
*  what's going to determine its terminal valuation. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4295.62s)]
*  You know that they they have always been under monetized, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4297.74s)]
*  $800 million in revenue reportedly, and 400 million [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4300.74s)]
*  monthly active users. So two bucks a user compared to, you [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4305.26s)]
*  know, 2030, 40 for the prime users in on Facebook's network. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4309.22s)]
*  So it's totally underutilized. Part of it is it's a little bit [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4315.54s)]
*  of spicy content. Part of it is that that's the number of [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4318.0599999999995s)]
*  including all the international users. Of course, SACS there is [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4320.54s)]
*  this concept that Reddit has the greatest pool of data for large [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4324.54s)]
*  language models. And, you know, something like say Quora, maybe [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4329.38s)]
*  YouTube, amongst the great pools of data. So you think there's a [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4333.5s)]
*  play here with that they have talked about they want to get [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4338.22s)]
*  paid for licensing and that if you want to use their data for [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4340.34s)]
*  your language money, you got to get permission to your thoughts [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4342.54s)]
*  SACS. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4344.5s)]
*  Sure. I mean, that's going to be an incremental revenue source [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4345.14s)]
*  for sure. It's hard to know exactly how valuable that is, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4347.46s)]
*  because we're still in the early innings. But I mean, they can [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4349.5s)]
*  definitely do something with that data. Grok's whole [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4351.9s)]
*  competitive advantage is having exclusive access to Twitter's [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4353.94s)]

*  millions of users. So yeah, look, that data is valuable. We [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4360.78s)]
*  don't know how much I guess the numbers I saw were that they're [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4364.179999999999s)]
*  doing about 800 million of revenue growing about 20% a [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4367.9s)]
*  year. The $5 billion valuation seems, I think pretty good. I [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4370.299999999999s)]
*  mean, is it down from 10 at the peak in 2021? Sure, but [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4375.7s)]
*  everything is down since that peak. I mean, that was [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4379.419999999999s)]
*  definitely a bubble. I mean, I can tell you we bought some [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4381.9s)]
*  shares as a late stage investment, I think in 2018, at [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4384.66s)]
*  a $2 billion valuation. Okay, so you know, a two and a half x in [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4388.62s)]
*  five years. I mean, it's not setting the world on fire, but [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4392.66s)]
*  it's not a bad outcome. Yeah. And you know, the investment [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4394.54s)]
*  bankers will know how to price this to take it out and make it [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4398.219999999999s)]
*  successful. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4401.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, then if it had a if it was a if it becomes a billion [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4401.62s)]
*  dollars in revenue, and they have a 20% profit margin 200 [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4404.259999999999s)]
*  million, you can you can start doing your back of the envelope [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4407.74s)]
*  math there for 25 EBITDA, you know, 20 times price earnings [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4410.74s)]
*  ratio. So it doesn't seem outrageous. It does seem like [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4415.0199999999995s)]
*  such valuable and under under monetized and asset. Do you [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4418.3s)]
*  think there's a likely acquirer here if you were to think about [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4422.219999999999s)]
*  somebody who might want to own this? Do you think it's a [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4425.139999999999s)]
*  Microsoft for the data Google for the data? [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4427.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's probably people who'd like to own this. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4429.66s)]
*  But the problem is that about two problems. One is they just [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4432.0599999999995s)]
*  can't get it through. We've talked about this before. The M&A [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4434.86s)]
*  window is even more closed than the IPO window, I would say. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4437.94s)]
*  Yeah. And the other thing is just because of the raunchy [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4442.62s)]
*  content, and all of the brand issues that come with that. It's [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4445.98s)]
*  not clear to me that let's say a Microsoft would want to own that [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4450.46s)]
*  headache. You know, they might not want to be hauled up in [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4453.5s)]
*  front of these congressional hearings that we talked about. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4455.94s)]
*  These kangaroo courts where it's very easy to go on Reddit and [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4458.46s)]
*  pick out well, what about this post? What about that post? Why [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4461.78s)]
*  did you let that one through? Why did you let that one through? [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4464.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, because it's a it's a platform of user generated [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4466.42s)]
*  content where hundreds of millions of people post what [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4469.18s)]
*  billions of items. And you can have the best content moderation [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4472.02s)]
*  policy in the world is always gonna be edge cases I get [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4475.26s)]
*  through. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4477.1s)]
*  I think that Reddit is the honeypot of edge cases. It is the [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4477.58s)]
*  place you go when you're just so disaffected that you can just let [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4480.74s)]
*  loose anonymously. It's not right. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4484.86s)]
*  I mean, at a certain point, you have to you have to realize that [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4486.7s)]
*  when people cherry pick those edge cases, what they're really [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4489.1s)]
*  saying is a platform like this shouldn't exist. Yeah, right. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4492.9400000000005s)]
*  Because there's no way to eliminate every single one. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4496.3s)]
*  Which is basically like saying if you just take platform, you [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4500.18s)]
*  say conversation, you're saying this conversation shouldn't be [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4502.54s)]
*  allowed to exist. User generated content to exist. They don't [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4505.14s)]
*  want on what remember what the New York Times called unfettered [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4508.5s)]
*  conversations, unfettered conversations, controlled [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4511.3s)]
*  conversations. Yeah. Yeah, pretty dangerous. It just [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4514.38s)]
*  reminds me of remember, Bob Iger for like 10 seconds was actually [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4519.14s)]
*  considering Disney buying Twitter. Can you imagine if they [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4523.26s)]
*  actually bought it? What would have happened? I mean, it would [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4527.34s)]
*  have been chaos. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4530.860000000001s)]
*  Well, it would have been it would have been content [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4532.58s)]
*  moderation on steroids where yeah, they would have massively [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4533.9800000000005s)]
*  empowered and scaled up content moderation even more than what [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4537.38s)]
*  Jack Dorsey's Twitter was doing. So I think Jack actually he was [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4540.9400000000005s)]
*  unable to operationalize his principles, but he did have [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4543.820000000001s)]
*  principles in favor of free speech. Whereas Disney, I don't [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4546.06s)]
*  even think has those principles. So they wouldn't [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4551.1s)]
*  there. They would have censored everything. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4553.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, it's paradoxically the most censored [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4556.3s)]
*  social media platform is tik tok like my tik tok is bulldogs [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4560.06s)]
*  and sandwiches like you trim off and then sopranos clips. And [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4564.18s)]
*  every time there's sopranos clips, when somebody gets [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4567.9400000000005s)]
*  whacked, they have to blur it out or they the person who's [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4569.620000000001s)]
*  uploading it takes that clip and cuts out the actual person being [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4572.34s)]
*  whacked. It's crazy. All right, I got to give sex his red meat. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4576.18s)]
*  We're going to now go to our work course David Sachs. But in [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4579.38s)]
*  all seriousness, tragically, we had a terrorist attack. And the [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4582.820000000001s)]
*  response from some of our Republican senators was [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4589.06s)]
*  absolutely insane. They want to bomb Tehran and go after Iran [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4594.18s)]
*  and start World War Three. Sachs, I know you have some [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4598.66s)]
*  strong feelings on this. And you're always about diplomacy and [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4600.7s)]
*  pursuing peace. What's your reaction to Lindsey Graham and [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4604.42s)]
*  the neocons? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4607.54s)]
*  Well, you had several Republican senators try to go Biden into [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4609.38s)]
*  striking Iran immediately. It was, you know, not just Lindsey [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4612.780000000001s)]
*  Graham, who's in favor of every war, but it was Mitch McConnell [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4616.54s)]
*  is the Senate Republican leader, John Cornyn. And there were some [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4620.02s)]
*  other ones who are, you know, demanding immediate retaliatory [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4623.58s)]
*  strikes. It's very unfortunate that we had three of our troops [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4626.54s)]
*  get killed and another dozen or so get injured. This was at a [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4631.58s)]

*  saying that we have no business being in Syria. I mean, I tweeted [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4642.0199999999995s)]
*  10 months ago, that all we were doing was putting our troops in [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4644.66s)]

*  conflagration. And that's exactly where we are right now. I mean, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4653.58s)]
*  you had to know and many commentators pointed out that [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4657.66s)]
*  these bases are very exposed. They're very vulnerable. They [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4660.98s)]
*  don't have good enough air defense against they don't [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4664.3s)]
*  really have a good answer to the swarms of drones that these [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4667.34s)]
*  local militias have. And based on the intelligence we have [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4672.1s)]
*  right now, are the space this tower 22 was attacked by an [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4676.14s)]
*  Iraqi militia that's operating there. Why did they get [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4680.34s)]
*  attacked? Well, these militias want the United States out of [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4685.7s)]
*  their countries, they want them out of Iraq, the government of [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4689.400000000001s)]

*  Syria says we want you out of Syria. We are there without a [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4695.14s)]
*  congressional authorization for military force. I mean, what are [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4699.120000000001s)]
*  we doing in Syria? We're just occupying that country without [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4704.700000000001s)]
*  again without a war being ever declared against the Assad [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4709.58s)]
*  regime. So some of us have been saying we need to get out of [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4713.22s)]
*  there for some time. And if we don't, it's inevitable that [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4715.9400000000005s)]
*  something like this is going to happen. And sure enough, it did. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4717.9800000000005s)]
*  And when it does happen, you get this lunatic fringe, who [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4720.5s)]
*  unfortunately are some of the leaders of the Republican Party [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4723.18s)]
*  calling for a larger war against Iran. And I think Biden to his [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4726.46s)]
*  credit is so far held back. And he has not a lot of restraint [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4730.66s)]
*  lot has shown some restraint. However, they've been actively [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4734.42s)]
*  talking about this and all the reports are they're gaming this [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4738.26s)]
*  out. And there is going to be some sort of retaliatory strike. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4741.06s)]
*  It might be focused on these militias in Syria and Iraq, it [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4744.74s)]
*  could be attacking Iranian assets, we don't know. If they [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4749.66s)]
*  do attack Iranian assets, Iran has promised a response. So I [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4753.34s)]
*  think the Biden presidency is a little bit of a crossroads here, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4757.9s)]
*  depending on the action they choose, we could very rapidly [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4760.26s)]
*  find ourselves engaged in a wider regional war on five [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4762.98s)]
*  different fronts. I mean, a war with Iran would involve us in [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4767.9s)]
*  Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen, where we're already [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4772.98s)]
*  bombing. So this could turn into a huge conflagration in the [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4776.66s)]
*  Middle East. I don't think I should be drawn into this. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4781.42s)]
*  Yeah, no answers here. And yeah, the craziness to me, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4785.18s)]
*  Chabath is like, these people want to go bomb Tehran because [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4788.74s)]
*  you have, you know, some militias doing these activities. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4793.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, this like would be, you know, some terrorists, who's [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4797.38s)]
*  French, we're going to just blow up Paris, and a bunch of [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4800.94s)]
*  civilians are going to die. It's there's no proportionality [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4803.74s)]
*  here. And there's, there's, there's no direct relationship [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4806.1s)]
*  here. It's like two or three steps removed. What do you [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4809.22s)]
*  think, Shima? [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4811.02s)]
*  I think the thing that we've lost in this whole issue is, how [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4812.700000000001s)]
*  is it possible that a multi-deca billion dollar drone system was [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4817.860000000001s)]
*  designed by the military industrial complex in a way [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4824.1s)]
*  where when one of our drones is coming back, and there's an [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4827.34s)]
*  inbound drone, that doesn't seem like a weird edge case, where [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4830.38s)]
*  we couldn't handle it. Because at the at the root cause of what [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4834.42s)]
*  happened was a pretty faulty way in which we were dealing with [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4837.5s)]
*  confusion about what was our drone and what was the enemy [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4843.34s)]
*  drone. And I think that that's also worth talking about before [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4846.5s)]
*  we talk about bombing in other countries. We're the most [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4850.62s)]
*  sophisticated technological country in the world, our weapon [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4854.06s)]
*  systems are the most sophisticated weapon systems in [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4856.7s)]
*  the world. Am I supposed to believe that if Palmer, Lucky [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4858.9s)]
*  and Andrew were building this system that this is what would [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4862.54s)]
*  have happened? [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4865.46s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4866.0199999999995s)]
*  That there's no beaconing system on these drones that you could [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4867.58s)]
*  turn on remotely that there's no way when you see the number of [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4870.14s)]
*  drones in an aerospace that are yours so that you can quickly [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4873.62s)]
*  triangulate which ones are not yours. And all of this to me, I [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4876.38s)]
*  think is also worth exploring because if it's really, again, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4879.98s)]
*  faulty engineering, because of this monopoly, oligopoly in [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4884.62s)]
*  certain sectors of our economy, that then cause us to go and [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4890.3s)]
*  make a foreign relations decision about going to war. And [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4893.74s)]
*  we don't even talk about this thing as a root cause it's worth [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4896.9400000000005s)]
*  talking about a different example, on the same vein of [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4899.42s)]
*  this is like, it turned out that in that Alaska Airlines issue, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4902.58s)]
*  they actually ship the plane without the door plugs. Oops, we [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4907.5s)]
*  are the most sophisticated country in the world, guys. Our [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4912.74s)]
*  most sophisticated industries are not showing their best in [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4917.46s)]
*  this moment. And I think that this is yet another example of [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4922.46s)]
*  before we make totally separate decisions about war and [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4925.7s)]
*  implicating our children's safety. We can also just ask, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4929.38s)]
*  wait, we spent billions of dollars on this thing. How is it [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4933.58s)]
*  possible that this that this, like, honestly, like, this is [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4936.86s)]
*  exception handling. This is like, CS 101 type stuff, guys. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4940.34s)]
*  Well, the book the place in the door, and it's regulatory [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4946.1s)]
*  captures the answer. This is crazy. There's no competition. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4950.26s)]
*  And they're they're charging cost plus they're not innovating [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4953.900000000001s)]
*  anymore. And they need competition, right? Just like [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4956.820000000001s)]
*  SpaceX was massive competition for all of the governmental [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4959.18s)]
*  agencies around we have execution in our industrial [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4964.02s)]
*  complex. Yes. Now the way to answer that turns out to be a [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4969.14s)]
*  foreign policy decision to go to war. And I think that those [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4973.7s)]
*  two things need to be decoupled for a second so that we can [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4976.74s)]
*  deescalate and say, hold on a second, this thing happened. But [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4979.179999999999s)]
*  why did it happen? Meaning, of course, people are going to [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4983.34s)]
*  attack us. We are the bright shining beacon on a hill. People [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4986.34s)]
*  should hate us and want to attack us. That's just the [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4990.0199999999995s)]
*  nature of being a winner. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4992.3s)]
*  To be fair, they're not attacking us because we're the [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4993.58s)]
*  shining city on a hill over here, just minding our own [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4996.42s)]
*  business. They're attacking us because we're [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=4998.7s)]
*  No, I know that. But I'm saying we should expect that these [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5000.86s)]
*  things work. We should expect it. So there's a few things [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5005.9s)]
*  happening here with our military industrial complex. So the first [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5009.219999999999s)]
*  one is that drones have been a huge game changer. We've seen [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5012.34s)]
*  this in the Ukraine war. The one really new technological element [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5015.0599999999995s)]
*  has been drones has completely changed the face of war. And one [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5019.42s)]
*  of the things it does, it's a huge leveler, because these [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5023.78s)]
*  cheap drones give these militias in Syria and Iraq, or it gives [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5026.94s)]
*  the Houthis in Yemen, a capability to strike at us that [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5031.219999999999s)]
*  they didn't have before. And we saw that our air defenses are [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5034.94s)]
*  just not really cut out to deal with this. There was that [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5038.82s)]
*  article describing how it was costing us $2 million to use an [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5042.0599999999995s)]
*  air defense missile to shoot down the drone or a cheap [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5046.46s)]
*  rocket that costs just a few thousand dollars. So you have [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5050.419999999999s)]
*  this asymmetric warfare now, where we simply cannot afford [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5054.7s)]
*  over sustained period to shoot down all these drones. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5059.0599999999995s)]
*  But wait, sorry, can I ask a question? Yeah. Our most [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5063.099999999999s)]
*  important partner in that region is Israel. Israel has what we [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5066.26s)]
*  have fought to up until now, an impregnable system, right, the [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5072.0599999999995s)]
*  Iron Dome, and which is meant to deal with all of these edge [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5075.66s)]
*  cases, right, projectiles of all sorts, shapes and sizes coming [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5079.58s)]
*  in every direction. Yeah, I've never heard of when the Iron [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5083.78s)]
*  Dome has failed. And we are sending Israel billions of [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5086.66s)]
*  dollars. Why couldn't we actually just buy the Iron [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5090.62s)]
*  Dome system for them and say, you know what, we're going to [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5092.86s)]
*  secure our bases in Syria. And in all these other places? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5094.98s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'll tell you. So there's a military analyst named [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5098.58s)]
*  Stephen Bryan, who I follow as a former Under Secretary of [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5101.66s)]
*  Defense. And he talked about this. He has been calling now [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5104.82s)]
*  for before this attack happened to send two Iron Dome systems to [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5108.54s)]
*  Syria to Iraq to basically the Middle East to protect our [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5112.74s)]
*  troops. He says he said in his article, the reason why the US [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5115.179999999999s)]
*  Army hasn't done that is because they didn't want to buy the [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5118.78s)]
*  Israeli system. They've been favoring some homegrown system [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5121.5s)]
*  that has improved corruption. There's a there's a big problem [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5124.3s)]
*  there that we should be deploying Iron Dome there. Look, [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5127.58s)]
*  I would just get out of that area. I don't think we should be [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5130.139999999999s)]
*  there. But at a minimum, if we are going to stay there, we have [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5132.7s)]
*  to protect our troops. So yes, we should be deploying Iron [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5135.0199999999995s)]
*  Dome. But the problem is that again, just these drones are a [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5137.74s)]
*  game changer, and they can overwhelm a system even Iron [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5142.46s)]
*  Dome can be overwhelmed. If Israel gets in a war with [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5146.26s)]
*  Hezbollah, which supposedly has one drone, it's n equals one, we [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5150.34s)]
*  were overwhelmed by n equals one. Well, I mean, I'm just I'm [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5154.86s)]
*  saying like, it's true, right? We were overwhelmed when n equals [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5159.34s)]
*  one. There was a report just the other day that one of our ships [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5163.3s)]
*  in the Red Sea, it was fired on by a missile from Yemen. And it [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5166.9s)]
*  made it through the Aegis system. And they took it down [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5174.42s)]
*  with their last line defense these like close in guns. That [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5177.42s)]
*  was kind of scary, because the Houthis have missiles that are [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5181.58s)]
*  capable of making it through our main air defense system for [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5184.9s)]
*  ships. So I'm just saying like these what's happening with [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5187.66s)]
*  these cheap rockets and these drones is it's giving our [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5190.82s)]
*  opponents capabilities that level the playing field a little [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5194.22s)]
*  bit. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5197.26s)]
*  But this is what I'm saying. I understand that concept. But I [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5197.5s)]
*  also understand that we have people on the ground that work [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5199.9400000000005s)]
*  for Team America. Again, I'll just take Palmer Lucky as the [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5202.58s)]
*  example, who frankly, I would bet on 1000 times over a Houthi [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5206.26s)]
*  rebel, he'll outsmart now power these guys, why aren't our best [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5209.9400000000005s)]
*  and brightest people in a position to make these things? [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5213.820000000001s)]
*  Well, you're right that defense industry is dominated by five of [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5216.14s)]
*  these prime defense contractors who work on cost plus are [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5219.5s)]
*  basically an oligopoly. They're not particularly innovative, but [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5223.1s)]
*  they just keep charging more every year for the same [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5226.1s)]
*  product. So we're getting less for more money. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5228.58s)]
*  And they're led by leadership, who are motivated in a way where [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5231.02s)]
*  the returns that they generate and the success and the progress [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5235.620000000001s)]
*  they make is not really coupled to progress, right? It's not [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5238.46s)]
*  really coupled to building an even better version of Iron [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5241.26s)]
*  Dome. It's about as you said, having a job that you've earned [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5244.660000000001s)]
*  over many years of fealty, and then getting paid an enormous [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5248.900000000001s)]
*  amount of money to just keep it going in the same direction, even [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5253.06s)]
*  if that direction means you've been adrift for decades. That's [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5256.38s)]
*  the shame of it. And then you're seeing every day, like isn't it [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5259.3s)]
*  incredible Lindsey Graham is saying hit Iran. And I bet you [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5262.22s)]

*  companies. I don't I don't know. But look, there's no question [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5267.740000000001s)]
*  that we need to shake up the military industrial complex, we [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5271.14s)]
*  need to get a lot more startups in there. There's a lot of VCs [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5274.14s)]
*  now who are funding, yeah, defense startups. So it is a big [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5278.22s)]
*  area. Andrew, obviously, is kind of the leader of the pack. But [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5281.7s)]
*  there's a bunch of others getting funded. I saw that Eric [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5284.0599999999995s)]
*  Schmidt even created a drone company. So this is gonna be a [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5286.7s)]
*  huge area of innovation. And I think that because of the Ukraine [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5290.18s)]
*  War, the Pentagon must now realize the urgency of being able [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5294.9s)]
*  to mass produce effective drones as well as create effective drone [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5300.66s)]
*  air to measure. Yeah, countermeasures. Yeah, just to [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5306.0199999999995s)]
*  give you a sense of this, like we [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5308.7s)]
*  led the series a and a company called sale drone about seven [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5312.42s)]
*  years ago, and they make drones for the seas, right. And what we [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5315.22s)]
*  did was we put these massive sensor arrays in these drones. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5320.0599999999995s)]
*  And because of because of the sensors, it has perfect [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5324.0599999999995s)]
*  visibility into what's going on in any condition of weather, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5329.0199999999995s)]
*  right day night, it doesn't matter. And so these drones in [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5332.58s)]
*  the Middle East, all over the waterways allows us to have [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5336.06s)]
*  perfect understanding of what's going on. But despite that, it [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5339.860000000001s)]
*  has taken years for us to be in a position to generate enough [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5343.54s)]
*  revenue. And now we're finally at that scale with the Navy and [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5347.02s)]
*  and whatnot. But David, to your point, it is incredibly hard for [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5350.1s)]
*  startups, no matter how innovative we've been to break [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5354.660000000001s)]
*  through this logjam. And it's and the reason is because what [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5358.38s)]
*  we are good at is not what's rewarded, we are good at [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5361.660000000001s)]
*  engineering and execution. But what is rewarded, to your point [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5364.86s)]
*  is this very lobbying specific form of relationship management, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5368.26s)]
*  right, and cultivating certain pockets of influence. It's a [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5373.38s)]
*  very difficult game to play. If what we come as bright eyed [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5377.66s)]
*  bushy tail from California with a product that we think is [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5381.9s)]
*  superior that actually helps advance American exceptionalism. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5384.34s)]
*  It still doesn't always land. It takes a lot longer than it needs [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5388.1s)]
*  to in some cases. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5391.38s)]
*  Yeah, so the Pentagon and the military industrial complex is [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5392.58s)]
*  going to be a lot more permeable to this type of innovation. I [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5396.34s)]
*  think that they're going to be incentivized to do it now, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5400.06s)]
*  because they have to see what's happening in Ukraine, what's [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5402.54s)]
*  happening in the Middle East, and they realize that the gap is [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5405.22s)]
*  closed. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5408.42s)]
*  And we have three innocent people that were killed. These [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5409.02s)]
*  people didn't deserve to die. They didn't deserve to die in an [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5411.1s)]
*  n of one. It's not an edge case and a one there was a drone. Come [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5414.14s)]
*  on, guys, we're better than that. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5419.26s)]
*  And so what do you think is going to happen if we get into [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5420.3s)]
*  war with Iran, every single one of our bases in Syria and Iraq, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5422.46s)]
*  and we have a lot are going to be sitting ducks. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5426.9400000000005s)]
*  To your point, you're forecasting your your orchestrating [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5428.900000000001s)]
*  a game plan for them. Because it's like, if you if you were [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5431.900000000001s)]
*  going to enter a war, does it take a brilliant strategist to [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5434.5s)]
*  sit in a room and say, wait a minute, if they can't defend [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5437.54s)]
*  against one, what happens when we send 12? What happens when we [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5439.54s)]
*  send 12 to every single place? And to your point, Jason, it's [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5442.66s)]
*  this is like the unnecessary escalation that then happens [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5446.3s)]
*  because then we have to respond with more force. Well, and with [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5449.7s)]
*  more energy, it was a certainty. Look, we haven't [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5453.86s)]
*  talked on the show about how our bases in Syria and Iraq have [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5457.9s)]
*  been under attack by these militias for months. I think the [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5461.42s)]
*  last time we talked about it, there had been something like 80 [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5465.0199999999995s)]
*  attacks. And it was just a matter of time before Americans [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5466.94s)]
*  servicemen were killed, unfortunately. And so like you [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5471.34s)]
*  said, Jamal, this was predictable. What's also [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5474.82s)]
*  unpredictable is that if we get in a war with Iran, every [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5477.54s)]
*  single one of our bases will be attacked. If we strike on their [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5480.38s)]
*  soil, they will strike back. And they have hypersonic missiles, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5483.34s)]
*  they have precision missiles, they can destroy every one of [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5486.78s)]
*  these bases, unless those bases have the top of the line air [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5490.98s)]
*  defense, which most of them don't. But if you go to someone [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5493.74s)]
*  like Lindsey Graham and say, listen, our troops are [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5497.18s)]
*  vulnerable, we need to basically either pull out of Syria and [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5499.94s)]
*  Iraq, or we need to consolidate down to a few bases that have [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5503.7s)]
*  iron dome or the best systems. These neocons will say absolutely [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5507.42s)]
*  not we're not conceding anything. So they would never [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5510.38s)]
*  pick up a gun, they never wear uniform. Right. They want us to [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5514.18s)]
*  strike Iran. So these these strategies don't line up. If you [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5517.58s)]
*  wanted to attack Iran, the first thing you would do is basically [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5522.9400000000005s)]
*  get all of our troops out of harm's way, who are currently [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5526.4s)]
*  sitting ducks for Iranian retaliation. By the way, I think [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5528.9800000000005s)]
*  it'd be a terrible idea. But that's what you do. So they have [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5532.3s)]
*  these strategies that don't make any sense. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5535.34s)]
*  All right, everybody. This has been an amazing show for the [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUuEE2jmP2c&t=5538.46s)]
