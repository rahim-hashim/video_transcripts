# E174 Inflation stays hot, AI disclosure bill, Drone warfare, defense startups & more
**All In Podcast:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY)
*  Alright everybody, welcome back to the All In Pod episode 174, almost up to 175. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=0.0s)]
*  I believe there are a lot of folks getting together next week at the All In Meetups around [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=6.48s)]
*  the world to watch the show. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=10.56s)]
*  Unfortunately, J Cal had an oral incident this week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=12.52s)]
*  He will not be joining us. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=16.52s)]
*  I guess he cracked a tooth and couldn't make it. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  So he is sitting this one out, very last minute decision. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=23.02s)]
*  Cracked a tooth, eating a bison rib at the Salt Lick in Austin, which is a true story. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=27.0s)]
*  Freebar, I think we found an image of J Cal at the Salt Lick, cracking his tooth on a rib. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=33.28s)]
*  Alright, so we are going to announce the All In Summit 2024 back to LA. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=57.8s)]
*  We had such a great time in LA. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=64.88s)]
*  It was a great location for everyone. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=66.04s)]
*  We really appreciated the facilities at UCLA. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=67.76s)]
*  This year we're upgrading the experience once again for everyone. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=71.08s)]
*  So the event's going to be September 8th through 10th in LA. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=74.48s)]
*  If you haven't seen it, please watch the recap video from last year. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=77.36s)]
*  We put it up on YouTube. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=81.12s)]
*  And then there's all the interviews from last year also on YouTube. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=83.44s)]
*  We're going to have another amazing lineup of speakers this year and have a much more [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=86.72s)]
*  kind of upgraded, elevated experience for everyone. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=90.62s)]
*  Applications are open today. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=93.92s)]
*  So go to summit.allinpodcast.co to put an application in, to join us this year. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=95.36s)]
*  As you know, we had way more applications last year than spots. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=101.4s)]
*  And this year we're going to have all sorts of upgrades. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=104.88s)]
*  We're going to have transportation to and from all the events for everyone, a concierge [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=107.48s)]
*  booking service to help you book your rooms and get you set up in LA for the trip. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=110.56s)]
*  We're doing a full day event on the Sunday, September 8th, followed by two days of content, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=115.74s)]
*  dine about town on the first night, two blowout parties. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=121.02s)]
*  It's going to be awesome. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  So we're really excited about it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  We've got a much bigger budget this year and we're going to try and really make the experience [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  awesome while also delivering the great content. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=130.9s)]
*  So really excited to do this again in LA. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=133.9s)]
*  I appreciate everyone's support of that. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=136.34s)]
*  We had a lot of debate internally about where to take it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=138.7s)]
*  We settled on going with what we know and trying to make it a little bit better this [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=143.18s)]
*  year. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=147.02s)]
*  So anything else you guys want to say about All in Summit? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=148.02s)]
*  And there's only one kind of ticket this year, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=150.78s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=153.10000000000002s)]
*  So we're not doing like regular ticket and VIP. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=154.10000000000002s)]
*  We're just doing one ticket for everyone. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=156.5s)]
*  And everyone's going to get this kind of elevated experience. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=158.18s)]
*  Should be cool. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=161.02s)]
*  Saks, just show up. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=162.18s)]
*  Would be awesome. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=163.68s)]
*  We hope to see you there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=164.68s)]
*  I want to invite a couple of speakers. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=165.68s)]
*  Yeah, you've got some good speakers I saw. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=167.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=169.78s)]
*  It's going to be great. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=170.78s)]
*  We're announcing the speakers, Freebird. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=172.1s)]
*  We will do that in a couple of weeks. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=173.94s)]
*  We already have a bunch booked and it's going to be awesome. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=176.42s)]
*  Oh, that's really exciting. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=179.78s)]
*  That's awesome. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=181.34s)]
*  Yeah, I know CP, you wanted to take it somewhere else. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=182.34s)]
*  I mean, we were in debate on Vegas, maybe going to some other country. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=184.42000000000002s)]
*  But you went to another country. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=190.26s)]
*  Where'd you go this week? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=191.54s)]
*  I was in Paris, France. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=192.54s)]
*  What were you doing there? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=193.54s)]
*  There was an important AI conference and Jonathan Ross, the founder of Grok and I kicked [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=196.46s)]
*  it off with a fireside chat for 45 minutes at the beginning just to get everybody amped [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=202.66s)]
*  up and excited. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=208.16s)]
*  Cool. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=209.16s)]
*  Yeah, it was really good. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=210.16s)]
*  Anything interesting come out of it? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=212.82s)]
*  I think the sound bite that made an impact on me was from Jonathan. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=215.62s)]
*  He did a very good job of explaining where NVIDIA is really strong, which is really in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=221.66s)]
*  learning and where NVIDIA is trying to build the business, which is an inference. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=227.82s)]
*  But the problem is the features almost compete with each other between learning and inference. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=234.54s)]
*  I think that that was a good clarification. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=240.3s)]
*  Then the second thing is he said that if he deploys his roadmap, he'll have 50% of the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=242.78s)]
*  available inference compute by the end of next year. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=247.42s)]
*  Based on all the needs of OpenAI and Meta and everybody else, which is a... [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=251.34s)]
*  Wait, but that's a smaller physical footprint, is that right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=254.85999999999999s)]
*  And it's just because they can do higher token per second? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=257.9s)]
*  Less power, higher tokens per second across all the major models. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=260.06s)]
*  So it would be meaningfully less power and meaningfully cheaper. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=265.65999999999997s)]
*  So that was a pretty amazing sound bite. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=270.94s)]
*  His whole explanation was actually really good. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=273.52s)]
*  So if you listen to the spaces we did, I thought it was good. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=275.21999999999997s)]
*  I thought this was even better. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=278.34s)]
*  So I'm trying to get a copy of the talk because it was taped so that we can post it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=279.68s)]
*  At a minimum, anybody who's interested in studying NVIDIA should listen to what he has [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=287.64s)]
*  to say because I think the nuances between us and them are really profound and they were [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=291.04s)]
*  pretty stark the way that he described them. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=296.2s)]
*  So it's cool. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=297.92s)]
*  It was great to be in Paris, frankly. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=298.92s)]
*  How does NVIDIA respond to this movement or this notion that there is an entirely different [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=300.12s)]
*  chip category focused purely on inference? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=305.24s)]
*  Do they have inference focused chips in development or a different roadmap that they're going [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=307.72s)]
*  to have to kick up now? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I think it's very hard for them. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  It is a structural innovator's dilemma. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=315.48s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=317.88000000000005s)]
*  Because they've made some architectural decisions around things like HBM, which is high bandwidth [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=318.88000000000005s)]
*  memory or specific kinds of extremely high throughput optical cables. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=323.0s)]
*  And why these things matter is that they've gone and bought up the world supply and they've [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  basically bear hugged these markets as a structural part of their design. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=334.0s)]
*  Now that makes sense and it's very legal. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=338.6s)]
*  The problem is that if you architect around it and go through a totally orthogonal design [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=342.0s)]
*  process, we're not subject to any of those supply chain considerations. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=347.12s)]
*  And I think he explained that really well. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=351.48s)]
*  I didn't understand it in nearly as much detail as I did leaving. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=353.24s)]
*  So I think that's an important takeaway. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=356.96s)]
*  It's also really important for all the hundreds of chip startups and for these venture investors [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=358.64s)]
*  who are ripping money into these companies to know these differences. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=362.8s)]
*  Because if you are investing in a company that is subject to HBM in their design decisions [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=365.76s)]
*  or these specific optical cables or a whole bunch of other things, you're going to be [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=372.72s)]
*  in a really difficult spot because Nvidia has bought them all. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=376.92s)]
*  So I thought that that was really interesting. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=380.68s)]
*  The other thing that Nvidia does brilliantly is what Intel did in the 80s and 90s when [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=382.88s)]
*  they wanted to kind of choke the market for CPU competition, which is that they were able [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=386.32s)]
*  to define a metric that everybody started to pay attention to, which for them was clock [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=392.56s)]
*  speed. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=397.68s)]
*  And if you remember, Intel would push Moore's law and they would push transistor density [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=398.68s)]
*  and clock speed as the measurement of value. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=404.76s)]
*  Now for a lot of consumers, none of us knew any better. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=407.48s)]
*  And so every time we saw a new chip, we would go through the Pentium upgrade cycle because [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=411.44s)]
*  we thought that's what we were supposed to do. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=416.44s)]
*  It turns out that clock speed doesn't really factor into speed the way that you think about [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=418.96s)]
*  it and experience it as an end user using software. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=423.88s)]
*  And it's the same in AI. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=428.59999999999997s)]
*  And so we talked about that as well. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=429.68s)]
*  So it's an incredibly important company, Nvidia is. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=431.32s)]
*  I think they're performing brilliantly. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=435.28s)]
*  They're running many of the same plays that Intel did to try to create total dominance. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=437.71999999999997s)]
*  But there's some very important nuances around power and around supply chain decisions and [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=442.74s)]
*  technology decisions that, frankly, some people would think are unsustainable. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=448.8s)]
*  And the more I understand them, I would be in that camp as well. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=454.42s)]
*  So I thought it was a very important conversation and hopefully we can post it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=458.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's cool. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=463.16s)]
*  And by the way, it's great to be in Paris too. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=464.16s)]
*  What do you think of Paris? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=466.6s)]
*  I have a new appreciation for what's going on in these major cities. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=468.40000000000003s)]
*  I think that all major cities are crumbling. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=471.48s)]
*  And I don't mean to be alarmist or very dramatic about that. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=474.88s)]
*  It's just that I spent a lot of time with entrepreneurs that are in Paris and they struggle [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=477.52s)]
*  with the same things that the people in San Francisco do. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=483.88s)]
*  And then I had a couple of conversations with some folks that are entrepreneurs in London [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=486.79999999999995s)]
*  who were there. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  And they suffer from the same things. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=492.88s)]
*  Lots of petty crime, lots of garbage, lots of vandalism, lots of drugs. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=494.91999999999996s)]
*  And so no place is perfect, it turns out. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=500.85999999999996s)]
*  City is struggling from a lot of experimentation gone wrong and how these cities run. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=503.2s)]
*  That was actually the biggest takeaway outside of the actual AI conference itself. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=508.76s)]
*  But that's a Western city problem. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=513.18s)]
*  Have you visited many cities in China or other parts of Asia? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=515.72s)]
*  And is that like a Western problem? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=520.0s)]
*  I have not been to China in six years. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=521.88s)]
*  I've been to Hong Kong but have not been into China for six years. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=526.12s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=529.62s)]
*  I would say that India has its own vagaries. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=531.88s)]
*  So those issues are not the same. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=534.9200000000001s)]
*  I've been to Singapore a couple of times. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=537.08s)]
*  My kids were just in Japan for spring break so I saw a bunch of the pictures. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=539.8000000000001s)]
*  Those cities look relatively the same. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=542.9200000000001s)]
*  Very orderly, well-run, clean. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=546.58s)]
*  But yeah, you're right. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=548.6800000000001s)]
*  These Western cities are a bit chaotic. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Sax, is this like a Western social liberal manifestation? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=551.0s)]
*  How cities are being challenged generally? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=556.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=558.6800000000001s)]
*  I think Malay said this, right? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=560.68s)]
*  He said like all these Western social liberal beliefs are having lifestyle impacts in urban centers. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=561.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, it's hard for me to speak to what's happening in Europe but we know what's happening [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=569.2399999999999s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=572.56s)]
*  All the biggest cities are blue and they're run by a certain ideology. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=574.52s)]
*  In those cities, we've had now a decade plus of decriminalization, de-prosecution, decarceration. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=579.7199999999999s)]
*  The impacts of this are obvious. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=588.48s)]
*  We also, at least in San Francisco, we have subsidies for people who want to live on the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=590.88s)]
*  streets and do drugs all day. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=596.18s)]
*  It's not prohibited to do that. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=598.24s)]
*  So all of our public space has been taken over by people who are happy to take the whatever [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=600.52s)]
*  it is, $700, $800 subsidy and do drugs all day. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=605.0799999999999s)]
*  You also had this referendum in California that essentially lowered a whole bunch of [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=608.0s)]
*  felonies to misdemeanors. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=615.68s)]
*  If you steal less than $950, that's considered a misdemeanor now instead of a felony. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=617.76s)]
*  So there's been a huge increase in crime because of that. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=624.04s)]
*  Shoplifting just doesn't get prosecuted anymore and misdemeanors don't get prosecuted anymore. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=628.6s)]
*  We've had all these source DAs who don't want to prosecute misdemeanors. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=632.2s)]
*  So I think if voters had understood that lowering a lot of these crimes from felonies to misdemeanors [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=635.56s)]
*  meant that they wouldn't get prosecuted at all. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=643.4s)]
*  I don't think they would have done it but that's kind of where we are. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=645.12s)]
*  Are we seeing a rebound from that now, Sax? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=647.6s)]
*  Is democracy working? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=649.5600000000001s)]
*  Because I know that in San Francisco we had an election recently and in the ballots it [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=651.0s)]
*  seemed to indicate that voters were sick and fed up with the living situation in the city [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=655.08s)]
*  and they're putting different people in office and have an intention of changing the city [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=662.36s)]
*  charter and changing the laws in the city so that we can reverse this trend. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=667.36s)]
*  Is that not where things are? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=674.44s)]
*  Don't you see San Francisco trying to right itself and as a result doesn't democracy work [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=678.1999999999999s)]
*  over time? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=683.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's just that we live in a one-party state and that one party has been captured [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=684.8s)]
*  by ideologues and so it's very hard to change. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=689.36s)]
*  It is true that in San Francisco there was an election recently and the more radical [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  supervisors were defeated. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=697.6s)]
*  We have I think finally a good DA in San Francisco but these radicals have had a long time to [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=699.36s)]
*  entrench their power and the party machinery helps keep them entrenched. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=706.02s)]
*  I think you can argue that we bottomed out because the public has recognized the problem [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=711.6999999999999s)]
*  but it's still very hard to fix and it's going to take a while. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=715.42s)]
*  I think for the first time in a long time I'm more optimistic than not given the people [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=718.1s)]
*  I've seen that tolerated the conditions historically have reversed course over the last year and [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=723.02s)]
*  have said we got to act and we got to do our kind of civic process. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=729.1s)]
*  Well time will tell you have to remember like when New York City was a chaotic mess in the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=733.3s)]
*  70s and 80s it took two different mayors and it took almost a decade for that to get cleaned [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=737.62s)]
*  up but it took the strength of leadership. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=743.26s)]
*  First David Dinkins set the framework and then Giuliani really executed Rudy Giuliani [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=745.8599999999999s)]
*  and between the two of them and I think what people call the broken windows theory they [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=751.9399999999999s)]
*  hired a lot more policemen and they just really cleaned up all of these really bad areas and [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=756.14s)]
*  then it had this knock on effect. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=762.38s)]
*  The problem is when I'm staying at a hotel in Paris or when I was speaking to some of [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=764.06s)]
*  my friends who live in London it's the same thing. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=769.86s)]
*  It's like the amount of knife crime is so egregious as an example that they tell you [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=772.74s)]
*  don't wear a watch etc. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=778.22s)]
*  I mean I don't wear watches anymore when I go out but what's crazy is they will tell [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=779.34s)]
*  you that you'll get stabbed over a phone where it's like you don't need to stab me for my [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=784.62s)]
*  iPhone here just take the iPhone. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=789.1s)]
*  So there's a level of lawlessness and petty crime that's affecting tourists that to me [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=791.1s)]
*  was like very surprising and so even when I was walking around Paris I was like should [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=797.58s)]
*  I really feel scared here? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=801.98s)]
*  And my reaction was no I've never felt scared in Paris but then what's ringing in the back [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=806.02s)]
*  of my ears are these warnings from people that have lived there for 10 and 20 years [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=810.66s)]
*  who had this stuff happen to them. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=816.22s)]
*  That was really surprising to me. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=817.8000000000001s)]
*  So that stuff in San Francisco as far as I can tell or any major city in the West hasn't [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=818.9s)]
*  really been fixed because you haven't had a shift in leadership yet where they've really [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=823.4599999999999s)]
*  said okay we're going to double down on policemen and policing and we're going to amp up the [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=826.9599999999999s)]
*  punishment. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=833.34s)]
*  That hasn't happened. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=834.34s)]
*  Well I was just in Vegas this week and it doesn't feel- [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=835.34s)]
*  How was your trip? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=838.26s)]
*  Give us the trip report. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=839.26s)]
*  Yeah I went to the Google Next conference but I will say first off like no crime in [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=840.26s)]
*  Vegas. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=844.38s)]
*  Vegas is Vegas. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=845.58s)]
*  It's a very different environment. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=846.58s)]
*  But yeah I went to the Google Next conference. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=849.62s)]
*  I ended up going out because at Ohala we did a partnership with GCP so we're moving all [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=851.54s)]
*  of our infrastructure and doing a lot of model development on GCP. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=857.7s)]
*  And it was great. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=861.14s)]
*  I think there was 30,000 people at this event which was insane. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=863.02s)]
*  Have you guys been to any of these like AWS reInvent or the Google Next or any of these? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=866.22s)]
*  No I have not. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=872.02s)]
*  What I didn't realize prior to going to this was how much of an ecosystem there is. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=873.5s)]
*  They take over the whole convention center at Mandalay Bay and there's hundreds of companies [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=878.26s)]
*  that have built services or build services on GCP that are there pitching CIOs and CTOs [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=883.7s)]
*  of other companies. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=889.62s)]
*  And so it's this real network effect type of business model that I hadn't fully appreciated [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=890.9s)]
*  just how deep the network is and how entrenched it is. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=895.44s)]
*  I also got to go to this thing where I spent a lot of time with CIOs and CTOs at other [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=899.9s)]
*  companies big companies. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=904.26s)]
*  And a big takeaway for me that I also didn't realize was how most of them are not on a [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=907.3s)]
*  single cloud provider. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=911.4599999999999s)]
*  Almost everyone I spoke with is on multiple clouds. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=914.18s)]
*  So they're all on like AWS and Azure and GCP and they use different aspects of each cloud. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=918.18s)]
*  There's a lot of interoperability between the clouds now, which I had previously my [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=925.98s)]
*  naive concept of this because I'm obviously not deeply in the space was that a company [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=930.26s)]
*  picks a cloud and they move everything over to that one service provider. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=934.82s)]
*  But it turns out that they split and then they allocate dollars based on the services [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=938.78s)]
*  and the pricing. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=943.1s)]
*  So it was pretty clear that everyone is it's like a race to the bottom on pricing for basic [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=944.62s)]
*  commoditizing services in the cloud like data storage. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=951.26s)]
*  And then whoever has the better higher level services, whoever has access to better models [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=955.06s)]
*  or has a lower price on running models or on running things like inference, that's where [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=959.38s)]
*  the money is made. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=965.0999999999999s)]
*  And the gross margin on that is quite different. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=966.0999999999999s)]
*  And I think that's where a company like Google probably has a much bigger advantage because [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=968.9s)]
*  of the uniqueness and the quality of the models that they've developed. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=974.42s)]
*  But yeah, I just didn't I didn't really appreciate like how much there was. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=977.9799999999999s)]
*  So my other big takeaway was the cloud is a wide open competitive market right now. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=981.9s)]
*  Like there is no AWS lock in in this market. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=986.06s)]
*  There's no Azure lock in. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=988.5s)]
*  There's no GCP lock in like these guys. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=989.86s)]
*  The lock in comes from the developer services that they provide. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=992.54s)]
*  So both Amazon and Google, and I'm assuming Azure as well, will give you access to incredibly [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=996.34s)]
*  talented engineers who will help you build production code and the ecosystem. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1002.02s)]
*  So like a lot of the clouds are competing for the consultants who actually do the work [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1007.06s)]
*  for the big enterprises. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1013.0999999999999s)]
*  So Capgemini, Deloitte, PwC, they have these massive booths and facilities and then go [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1014.7399999999999s)]
*  and build tools for companies is also a key part of the business strategy. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1020.3599999999999s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, it's such a competitive market. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1025.22s)]
*  I did not appreciate just like how much of an open game this still was. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1027.06s)]
*  True. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1032.54s)]
*  So this was a great couple days in Vegas and I got to see some of our friends. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1033.54s)]
*  We ducked in and saw Hellmuth in the PokerGo studio for a minute. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1037.3799999999999s)]
*  Some big tournaments going on at the Aria. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1041.98s)]
*  It was fun. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1043.3s)]
*  We had a good time. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1044.3s)]
*  Okay, let's move on. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1045.3s)]
*  So, you know, on the docket today, we were going to talk about CPI. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1046.3s)]
*  The March CPI numbers came in from the Bureau of Labor Statistics yesterday, higher than [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1050.6399999999999s)]
*  forecast at 3.5% year over year. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1054.54s)]
*  This is up from 3.2% year over year inflation reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1058.46s)]
*  in February, higher than expected for three straight months now. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1063.96s)]
*  Let's pull up this chart next. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1067.66s)]
*  As we all know, the Fed did 11 rate hikes in 2022 and 23. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1068.66s)]
*  And the intention was that we would see inflation come down to their target of 2% and they would [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1073.22s)]
*  start to lower rates. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1078.14s)]
*  And obviously, we're not seeing that. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1080.2s)]
*  Inflation is remaining hot. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1082.46s)]
*  Things are getting more and more expensive. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1084.56s)]
*  I pulled together some of the numbers on year over year price increase. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1087.68s)]
*  Housing is up 5.7% year over year. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1093.3200000000002s)]
*  Transportation costs are up 10.7% year over year. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1096.28s)]
*  And the highest car insurance is up 22.2% year over year. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1100.1200000000001s)]
*  So the expectation has been that the market will do rate cuts. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1105.64s)]
*  Larry Summers came out and said, you have to take seriously the possibility that the [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1109.68s)]
*  next rate move will be upwards rather than downwards. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1112.8s)]
*  I guess, Sax, let me ask you first for your commentary on how this plays into the election [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1116.68s)]
*  cycle. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1122.2s)]
*  I know Biden was expecting a rate cut or several rate cuts going into the election, which usually [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1123.2s)]
*  helps the case of the incumbent. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1128.26s)]
*  Maybe you can comment on where the election cycle might be influenced by this inflation [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1129.8s)]
*  report. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1135.8s)]
*  Well, I think it's definitely bad news for Biden. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1136.8s)]
*  I was expecting a Fed put this year. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1137.96s)]
*  And really, the whole market was. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1140.88s)]
*  The market was expecting three rate cuts this year, which would have been really good news [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1142.1200000000001s)]
*  for Biden. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1145.56s)]
*  And I think this latest inflation print was kind of a dagger to the heart of that expectation. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1147.68s)]
*  And I think the Wall Street Journal put it best. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1153.8s)]
*  It said here, Wednesday's report had been hotly anticipated because Fed leaders had [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1155.48s)]
*  been willing to play down stronger than anticipated in inflation readings in January and February [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1161.64s)]
*  as reflecting potential seasonal quirks. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1168.68s)]
*  But a third straight month of above expectations inflation data erodes that story and could [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1171.8s)]
*  lead Fed officials to postpone anticipated rate cuts until July or later. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1178.28s)]
*  So it's not just the fact that this inflation print was higher than expected. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1182.84s)]
*  It was also higher than expected in January and February. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1186.62s)]
*  But people were willing to kind of overlook that saying, well, maybe it was just kind [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1190.1599999999999s)]
*  of a quirky reading. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1193.68s)]
*  But now we've had three straight months. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1196.12s)]
*  It's pretty clear that the narrative that we had going into this year, which was that [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1197.52s)]
*  inflation was on its way down, that it peaked at 9% as the official rate, I think, in 2022. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1202.52s)]
*  And then it was going down every month through all of 2023. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1209.2s)]
*  And I think the expectation going into 2024 was it would keep going down. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1213.48s)]
*  We got these rate cuts. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1217.16s)]
*  Well, after three straight months of inflation being more persistent and stickier than people [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1218.16s)]
*  expected, I think that narrative is basically dead. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1224.24s)]
*  So I think the new narrative now is rates are going to be higher longer. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1227.16s)]
*  And I think Larry Summers is reflecting that view. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1234.0800000000002s)]
*  Larry's going further. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1236.0400000000002s)]
*  He's not just saying that rates are going to be at the current rates for longer. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1237.0400000000002s)]
*  He's saying they might actually increase. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1241.1200000000001s)]
*  And that's a risk. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1244.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1245.16s)]
*  Last summer, he said, and this was last summer. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1246.16s)]
*  So almost a year ago, he was saying the market's got it totally wrong. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1247.72s)]
*  We're actually going to need much higher rates than the market's anticipating for much longer [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1251.2s)]
*  as well than the market is anticipating. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1255.24s)]
*  And so did Mario Draghi. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1257.52s)]
*  They both said the same thing. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1258.64s)]
*  No one paid attention to him. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1260.3200000000002s)]
*  Everyone ignored it and assumed that this was going to be a quick rebound to normalization. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1261.72s)]
*  It's clear that once again, Larry has proven himself to be fairly prescient in understanding [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1265.8400000000001s)]
*  where things are headed. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1270.8000000000002s)]
*  Larry Summers has, for the most part, been spot on from this whole inflation question [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1271.8000000000002s)]
*  going all the way back to 2021. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1276.24s)]
*  Remember? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1277.88s)]
*  100%. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1278.88s)]
*  Of 2021, Biden's first quarter in office, the big legislative push was for the $2 trillion [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1280.0800000000002s)]
*  COVID relief bill. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1286.88s)]
*  It was the so-called American Rescue Plan. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1287.88s)]
*  And Larry Summers said that it risked inflation. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1290.5600000000002s)]
*  It was an inflationary bill. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1293.5600000000002s)]
*  It was unnecessary. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1294.5600000000002s)]
*  It was too stimulatory. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1295.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, too stimulatory. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1296.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1297.5600000000002s)]
*  The economy was already coming back, and we didn't need it. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1298.5600000000002s)]
*  And Biden was risking inflation. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1299.5600000000002s)]
*  But of course, inflation was only at 2% at that point. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1300.8400000000001s)]
*  So the administration kind of poo-pooed Larry and said, you know, this is Larry Summers [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1304.24s)]
*  being Larry or whatever. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1308.72s)]
*  And sure enough, we were at 5% inflation by that summer. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1311.16s)]
*  And you have to wonder if Biden had listened to that advice, would he be in a different [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1315.3200000000002s)]
*  position right now going into the election? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1320.76s)]
*  I think probably he would have been. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1322.5600000000002s)]
*  And you got to wonder for what? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1324.64s)]
*  I mean, what did that $2 trillion accomplish? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1325.92s)]
*  I mean, COVID was winding down. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1328.72s)]
*  I mean, these were the last bit of stimulus checks and payments to these pharma companies. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1330.28s)]
*  And I mean, it was basically a grab bag and it was passed on straight party lines. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1337.36s)]
*  And it was just totally unnecessary. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1341.6s)]
*  I mean, the economy certainly didn't need it. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1343.04s)]
*  And so here we are. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1345.04s)]
*  And I think that a lot of people, including the markets, thought that Biden was kind of [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1346.56s)]
*  out of the woods that this year we'd see the final leg of inflation going back to normal. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1353.28s)]
*  But that's not going to happen. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1359.1999999999998s)]
*  And I think, you know, going beyond the political ramifications, I think there could be several [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1360.1999999999998s)]
*  knock on effects that we should talk about. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1365.28s)]
*  I mean, one is for the consumer. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1367.76s)]
*  This means that the cost of borrowing is going to be higher for longer. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1372.2399999999998s)]
*  That makes it harder to buy a house. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1375.6s)]
*  Mortgage payments are higher. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1377.1999999999998s)]
*  That also means if there's fewer home sale transactions, that means the price of [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1378.8799999999999s)]
*  housing could come down. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1384.0s)]
*  So there could be a correction in that market. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1385.4399999999998s)]
*  Second, if you want to buy a car, your car payments higher. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1387.9199999999998s)]
*  And if you have loans, your personal interest is going to be higher. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1390.2399999999998s)]
*  And this is why I think consumers feel like they're worse off than the economic data would [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1394.32s)]
*  otherwise reflect. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1399.76s)]
*  And Larry Summers actually had a tweet storm about this about a month ago, where he calculated [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1400.56s)]
*  that if you included the cost of borrowing in inflation, that inflation was much higher [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1405.12s)]
*  than people thought and that it actually peaked not at 9%, but at 18%. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1410.56s)]
*  So Larry had an excellent tweet storm on that. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1416.08s)]
*  And he said that the cost of borrowing, which used to be calculated in inflation, but is [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1417.9199999999998s)]
*  not anymore, was the reason why consumer sentiment about the economy was depressed. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1422.32s)]
*  He said that that accounted for about 70% of it. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1428.32s)]
*  So people should be feeling better off because GDP growth is good and unemployment is low, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1430.56s)]
*  but they're not because inflation is so high. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1437.28s)]
*  And if you include costs of borrowing, the inflation is even higher. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1439.9199999999998s)]
*  So I think this is really bad news for Biden. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1444.3999999999999s)]
*  But it's a story that's been going on now for three years. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1446.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not just this one inflation print. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1449.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1452.72s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1453.36s)]
*  Yesterday, Biden said during a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1453.84s)]
*  Kishida that he's sticking with his prediction of a rate cut before year's end, but there [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1459.12s)]
*  might be a delay, which I think is obviously based on what the data is showing and what [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1464.24s)]
*  folks that seem to know and have been pretty good predictors are saying is unlikely. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1471.6s)]
*  We were supposed to get one in April. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1475.2s)]
*  Yeah, we were supposed to get one in June. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1476.8799999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1478.72s)]
*  The Fed Open Market Committee in December stated that they expected three rate cuts [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1479.68s)]
*  this year. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1484.64s)]
*  And I think the market in some cases were predicting as high as four or five. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1485.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1489.28s)]
*  And now we may not have any and we may actually see a rate hike if you were to follow some. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1489.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, if we see a rate hike before the election, I think Biden is toast. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1494.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1498.96s)]
*  But I mean, I think Summers gave that maybe a 15% to 20% chance, which is it's still [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1499.52s)]
*  not the most likely scenario, but it's possible. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1503.92s)]
*  And Noah was counting on that in December. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1508.16s)]
*  Chamath, if you're a Fed governor, and obviously the Federal Reserve Board of Governors sets [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1510.08s)]
*  the rates, they meet and they make these decisions, how influenced are they politically? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1516.08s)]
*  How influenced are they by this election cycle? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1522.32s)]
*  And historically, this is meant to be a fairly independent board, but there's been a lot of [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1524.4s)]
*  consternation over the last few years that this board acts like almost a political apparatus, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1530.24s)]
*  particularly in election years. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1535.36s)]
*  You mean when they're not plagiarizing? [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1538.0s)]
*  Well, tell us what you're talking about. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1541.36s)]
*  It turns out that before I answer your question, that was a joke. Nick, you can please show the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1546.24s)]
*  tweet. But there was an article that came out that said one of the Fed governors has apparently [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1551.92s)]
*  massively plagiarized most of the work that got her to the position of being Fed governor. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1558.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1563.44s)]
*  So the same thing that happened to the president of Harvard. So TBD, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1564.0s)]
*  what happens to that Fed governor? But it seems my observation there was just more that [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1567.04s)]
*  it's like the preferred method of defenestration now of academics and the apparatchik. Before, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1571.92s)]
*  if you had right-leaning views or centrist views, you get run out of town and get fired. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1577.84s)]
*  Now, all of those folks are using these search engines to basically figure out really quickly [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1583.28s)]
*  that you plagiarized a large quantity of your academic work and that your scholarship is a [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1589.2s)]
*  little bit more speculative, which then brings into question why do you get the right to help set [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1596.56s)]
*  the policy of the most important economy in the world? Well, anyways, so that was that joke. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1602.1599999999999s)]
*  So I think that you're asking the absolute right question. I think that the Fed has become [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1606.8s)]
*  increasingly politicized. And I do think that there are actions that foreign governments take [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1613.84s)]
*  to influence the election, but I do not think it's what most people think. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1622.88s)]
*  When I say that, most people's ideas goes to some darkroom conspiracy theory and misinformation. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1627.2s)]
*  And I think that's a little bit naive. I think the more obvious way in which other governments [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1634.0800000000002s)]
*  can impact the US election is exactly how SAC said, which is they know that if inflation ticks high [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1641.52s)]
*  and interest rates are up and consumers are under pressure and meaningfully displeased with the [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1647.8400000000001s)]
*  economy, they'll vote out the sitting administration. And so what can other governments do? They can do [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1651.76s)]
*  what they're doing. So Nick, I love this like explanation in pre-charts. Nick, chart number one, please. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1658.32s)]
*  What is this? So this is a core driver of inflation, which is the price of energy. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1666.32s)]
*  And what you see here is that since the beginning of the year, oil prices have gone up, which [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1672.4s)]
*  ultimately will translate to into a higher cost of doing business, right? Running your factory, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1679.28s)]
*  keeping the lights on, keeping your home warm, getting from point A to point B, all of these [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1684.3999999999999s)]
*  things go up, which would ultimately get reflected in prices, which is what inflation is. And so [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1690.3999999999999s)]
*  that's a very bad trend. Obviously, we had a lot of really good stuff happen through the course of [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1695.36s)]
*  last year, but it's largely reversed itself. So it's important to double click into this and figure [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1700.48s)]
*  out, well, who's driving this? Is it just a random act or is it a systemic set of decisions? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1706.24s)]
*  And it turns out it's systemic. So if you go to the next chart, what this shows you is what the [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1712.88s)]
*  US has been doing. So the United States has clearly created an incentive to flood the economy with oil, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1717.52s)]
*  which the laws of supply and demand would say prices should go down. And by bringing prices [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1726.4s)]
*  further down, they would have further brought down inflation and they would have pulled forward [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1733.44s)]
*  these rate cuts that we had been expecting from the Fed. The problem is that the rest of the world [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1737.68s)]
*  actually said, no, hold on. And that's what you can see on the next chart. So for every time we [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1742.72s)]
*  were trying to increase production, all of these other countries have been cutting production. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1748.16s)]
*  And this is the change in the OPEC plus crude production targets of 2024. So what you see here [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1754.24s)]
*  is for every barrel of oil the US would pump out of the ground, more than that one barrel of oil [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1760.32s)]
*  would get actually restricted by all of these countries on this list, which is just to show [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1765.6s)]
*  you that these countries have a very specific view about how they want that energy market. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1769.6s)]
*  And that's just one market, but it's an input, a key input into inflation and rates to work. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1775.28s)]
*  So you're saying that the OPEC has a price per barrel price target, and they're able [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1781.6s)]
*  to manipulate production to maintain that price target. So while the US is trying to lower the [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1787.28s)]
*  price per barrel, these other countries are able to have a stronger influence and balance out. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1790.8799999999999s)]
*  Right. When you make these cuts like this, prices will go up because OPEC plus is meaningfully [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1795.76s)]
*  bigger. The sum of all the parts of OPEC plus is meaningfully bigger than just the United States [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1801.36s)]
*  on its own. And so the United States may amp up a few hundred thousand barrels a day, but if OPEC [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1805.76s)]
*  cuts by a few million barrels a day, you see what you saw in that first chart, which is the [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1813.76s)]
*  price will go up. And that's largely why prices have gone up. So I think why this happens is [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1817.36s)]
*  because when they see the United States trying to manage inflation and manage global rates, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1822.48s)]
*  because US rates are not just for the United States, they're the trendsetter for everything else. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1828.96s)]
*  I think that in part, there's a decision that this rate philosophy, the economic philosophy, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1834.48s)]
*  the political philosophy, if they wanted to support that, what they would do is actually [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1839.2s)]
*  also keep prices where they were or increase production. But by reigning in production, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1844.48s)]
*  what you're essentially doing is voting against that entire apparatus. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1849.2s)]
*  Right? So OPEC and all of those countries, and those decisions are not made by an oil minister, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1853.44s)]
*  let's be honest. They're made by the leaders of those countries whose decision then gets [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1857.6000000000001s)]
*  reflected by the minister of petroleum or oil in all of these countries, is a vote against Biden [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1861.44s)]
*  and the United States government and the politicization potentially of the Fed. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1868.0s)]
*  And then the last comment is just that when you look at the reverse repo rate, which is [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1872.08s)]
*  a fundamental measure of liquidity, what you also see is liquidity very quickly getting sucked out [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1875.6s)]
*  of the system, which is also generally a system health check that the Fed uses to make sure that [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1881.2s)]
*  the system is operating as required. So in totality, what I see is that there is a structural [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1886.72s)]
*  disillusionment with the current administration and where people can make decisions in their [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1896.48s)]
*  own best interests versus the collective interests of the United States in a broader [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1902.8799999999999s)]
*  framework that the US may represent are voting against it. And so this is why the idea of a [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1908.32s)]
*  persistent inflation rate is a lot more credible than it was six months ago. And I think, sorry, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1914.16s)]
*  just the last point, and I think it's just what Sac says, which means that we're probably now [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1921.44s)]
*  on balance 50-50 between a hike and a cut. And I think if you don't see this thing change in [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1925.36s)]
*  the next three months, you're going to see 75-25 for a hike of at least 25 basis points. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1930.4799999999998s)]
*  And I do think David's right. I don't see how the sitting administration in any government [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1936.4799999999998s)]
*  will be able to withstand the onslaught of electoral displeasure if rates are four and a [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1942.8799999999999s)]
*  half, five and six percent going into November. Tomas, if that is, I think everything you said [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1949.9199999999998s)]
*  makes sense going into this election rates are high and and or going higher. What does the Biden [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1955.04s)]
*  administration do? The fact is they are very likely going to come up with a strategy to try [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1962.72s)]
*  and win votes that will likely involve some sort of stimulatory process would be my guess. And that [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1969.68s)]
*  stimulatory process may look something like more student loan forgiveness, more debt forgiveness. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1975.92s)]
*  Kamala Harris did that. She had a whole speech about debt forgiveness. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1981.52s)]
*  Here's the irony. The actions that the administration is likely to take to support [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1985.76s)]
*  themselves in the election cycle are likely going to further fuel inflation. And that's the biggest [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1991.9199999999998s)]
*  concern and worry I have is that there's almost this inevitable set of behaviors that are coming [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=1998.24s)]
*  down the pipe here over the next few months because of the inflation report that are actually going to [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2003.04s)]
*  make things worse, not better. I mean, to your point, Biden just announced a new student loan [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2007.2s)]
*  forgiveness plan. Remember, the Supreme Court invalidated his last one. So now he's trying [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2011.68s)]
*  again. And it would potentially give loan forgiveness to something like 30 million [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2015.44s)]
*  borrowers. So yeah, they're going to try and buy votes. But I think it's already very late in the [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2020.48s)]
*  game to be trying to do that. I think that's what they've been doing over the past few years. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2024.88s)]
*  I mean, Biden has been a huge spender. You know, he passed the COVID relief bill. He passed the [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2029.3600000000001s)]
*  Inflation Reduction Act, which was a ridiculous name for what was a 750 billion of more spending. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2034.88s)]
*  And there was the CHIPS Act, which was well, yeah, there was the CHIPS Act and the infrastructure bill. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2041.7600000000002s)]
*  And then remember, he wanted four and a half trillion of build back better on top of that. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2047.92s)]
*  And he wanted even more. He didn't get any of that. I think that this is a classic case of [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2052.1600000000003s)]
*  Biden spent the last three years making his bed and now he's going to sleep in it. And if in fact, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2057.6s)]
*  inflation is persistent and sticky and not going away and he doesn't get rate cuts, again, this may [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2063.6s)]
*  cost him the election. But look, I want to move beyond the political aspect of this and just talk [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2068.88s)]
*  about some more of these knock on effects because we talked about the impact on the consumer. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2073.12s)]
*  There's also an impact on investors. There's an impact on the government. And there's an impact [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2078.48s)]
*  on the banks. So let's just do what the banks for a second. We've talked about on the show how [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2084.48s)]
*  commercial real estate developers are hanging on by their fingernails right now. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2090.24s)]
*  You know, they basically borrowed huge amounts of money to buy commercial real estate when rates [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2094.8799999999997s)]
*  were really low and they did so at high valuations. Now there's been a huge correction on that market [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2100.9599999999996s)]
*  and they cannot pay back those loans and they can't get refinanced. So what's happening? Well, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2105.52s)]
*  they're working with the banks to restructure those loans to tack on the interest they can't pay now [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2111.2s)]
*  to the end of the loan and then the bank will hope and pretend that they'll be able to get paid [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2116.72s)]
*  back one day. It's called Extend and Pretend. Well, the Extend and Pretend strategy could work [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2121.3599999999997s)]
*  if you believe that rate cuts are coming really soon because you just need to hold on until the [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2126.72s)]
*  rate cuts are here and then you can get refinanced at lower rates. But if rates are going to be higher [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2131.2799999999997s)]
*  longer, that strategy is not going to work and you're going to see more and more real estate [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2135.9199999999996s)]
*  sponsors throwing in the towel and banks are going to end up foreclosing on these properties [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2139.52s)]
*  and you're going to see more and more fire sales. There's a really dramatic example just the other [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2144.4s)]
*  day in St. Louis, a building that was bought a few years ago for 200 million dollars just fire [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2148.2400000000002s)]
*  sailed at 2 million dollars. I mean, 99% reduction. This is like dot com crash level. That's for the [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2153.36s)]
*  equity, right? Yeah. No, this is like the price of the deal. I mean, I assume the equity was [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2159.44s)]
*  completely wiped out. Yeah, I guess they sold it for three and a half million. Are you sure [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2164.64s)]
*  that's not the equity? That's got to be the equity. There's no way that's the- No, it's just the price [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2168.48s)]
*  of the building. I don't know. It's got to have the debt attached to it. I mean, either way, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2172.24s)]
*  it's a total wipeout for the equity holders. But it's also going to be a wipeout for the bank that [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2178.24s)]
*  made that loan originally or that bought that loan when it was repackaged into CNBS or whatever it [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2183.2s)]
*  was. So I would expect that if rates stay higher longer, that's going to create tremendous stress [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2189.3599999999997s)]
*  on commercial real estate and therefore on the regional banking system that made all these loans [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2195.4399999999996s)]
*  to commercial real estate developers. So that's knock on effect number one. Knock on effect number [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2201.2799999999997s)]
*  two is the government's cost of borrowing. The 10-year rates already risen to four and a half percent [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2206.4s)]
*  now. And if rates stay higher longer, as more and more of the government debt rolls, it's going to [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2211.2s)]
*  end up getting refinanced to higher rates. And the need to refinance all of this government debt is [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2216.16s)]
*  going to continue to put pressure on the bond markets. And I think this is why Larry is [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2220.48s)]
*  fundamentally pretty bearish on rates going down is the government's financing costs are so huge [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2224.32s)]
*  and they continue to grow. We're adding something like a trillion dollars of new debt every [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2231.04s)]
*  hundred days. There have been some reports of this. Yeah. 7.6 trillion is getting refinanced [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2235.44s)]
*  of old debt in the next 12 months. Right. And that's 7.6 is sitting around 2% and now it's [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2241.2s)]
*  going to get bumped up to close to 5%, which adds an incremental $210 billion a year of debt service [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2248.48s)]
*  expense just on the debt that's getting refinanced in the next 12 months. Not to mention the deficit, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2257.28s)]
*  not to mention, et cetera, et cetera. Right. So the government was extending and pretending as [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2262.1600000000003s)]
*  well. I mean, they were hoping that rates would go down fast enough that when all of this massive [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2267.44s)]
*  government debt rolls and needs to be refinanced, it'd be done at lower rates. So the interest costs [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2273.2000000000003s)]
*  wouldn't swamp us. We're already, I think, at over a trillion dollars now of annual interest expense [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2278.0s)]
*  for the federal government. We are. Yeah. And it's going to get, it's going to rise to 1.6 trillion. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2283.2s)]
*  So it's going to be 60% greater than our defense budget, just servicing the old debt. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2287.4399999999996s)]
*  We're basically in a classic debt spiral where we're borrowing, our annual deficit is we're at 2 [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2292.08s)]
*  trillion plus now. So we're not paying back the principal on the debt. We're not even paying back [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2297.3599999999997s)]
*  the interest on the debt. We're borrowing money to pay off all the interest and then some on top of [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2303.3599999999997s)]
*  that. So that's a huge problem for the federal government. And then I think the last piece of [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2309.2s)]
*  this is investors. If you pull up this Fred chart on the Fed funds rate over the very, very long term. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2314.72s)]
*  So what this chart shows, if you just zoom in on this, is the Fed funds rate basically over the last, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2322.64s)]
*  I don't know, like 75 years. And you can see that it peaked in the early 1980s when Volcker [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2328.64s)]
*  decided to break the back of inflation by jacking up interest rates to like 18%. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2336.16s)]
*  And it was very painful. We had a pretty severe recession and I think it was [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2341.7599999999998s)]
*  81 or 82. But then the economy came roaring back by 83 and Reagan got elected in 84. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2346.7999999999997s)]
*  In any event, that began a period of declining and low interest rates for investors, again, starting [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2352.08s)]
*  in the mid 80s and it continued all the way through, I mean, especially through, I think, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2360.1600000000003s)]
*  the post-GFC period and then this COVID period where we had zero interest rates for a long period [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2366.48s)]
*  of time. And you can see the last spike we've had was when the Fed decided to jack up rates to 5% [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2372.1600000000003s)]
*  in response to inflation. So the fact that we've got this persistent, sticky inflation suggests [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2378.0s)]
*  that this whole, you could call it really almost a 40-year period of declining and low interest [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2383.28s)]
*  rates may be over. And when interest rates are going down, it creates a huge tailwind [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2389.92s)]
*  to the stock market and the bond market because the discount rate is lower. So stocks and bonds [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2395.92s)]
*  are going to be more valuable. Well, if we're in a long-term environment that's more inflationary [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2402.0s)]
*  and rates have to stay higher longer, that's not great news for investors. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2408.72s)]
*  It hurts the stock market and it creates in the private investing world like VC and real estate, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2413.4399999999996s)]
*  it creates a much higher hurdle rate. So it's harder for private investors to justify [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2419.04s)]
*  fundraising. So I think it's too early to say that this 40-year trend is over, but I think it could be [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2425.4399999999996s)]
*  and the reason for that is just the huge pressure of government borrowing, crowding out private [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2433.6800000000003s)]
*  investing and this ever-present need to keep issuing more and more debt at higher and higher [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2440.08s)]
*  rates to make it more attractive is going to create, I think, very bad conditions for investors. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2447.52s)]
*  So Chamath, let me ask you if you concur, given that today where we're sitting as of recording [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2454.56s)]
*  right now towards the end of market on Thursday, April 11th, the NASDAQ is sitting at an all-time [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2460.96s)]
*  high and the NASDAQ is up 1.6% today. Following this inflation report yesterday, what's the [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2466.16s)]
*  disconnect in the market on why investors are buying equities given that we're likely going to [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2473.52s)]
*  have persistent higher rates and as a result, multiple should compress particularly in growth [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2481.2s)]
*  stocks and why the NASDAQ is kind of firing up? I think it's important to look at what stocks [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2486.8799999999997s)]
*  are actually lifting the NASDAQ just like what stocks are lifting the S&P 500 and we've seen [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2494.7999999999997s)]
*  this. There's a massive dispersion. There's like seven or eight companies that matter and [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2500.3999999999996s)]
*  500 odd companies that don't matter much. And so the reason why things go up in an environment [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2504.24s)]
*  like that is irrespective of the economy, money managers are paid to deploy money. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2510.72s)]
*  I don't know if you guys saw this, but Nick, maybe you can find it. I linked to it in my newsletter [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2516.64s)]
*  last Sunday, which was an article about the fact that the global amount of total available [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2520.72s)]
*  equities to buy is shrinking. So if you think about that, what that means is that the number [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2526.16s)]
*  of dollars is growing linearly and in some years, it seems exponentially. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2533.2s)]
*  But then so then a certain percentage of that finds its way into the equity markets, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2539.2s)]
*  but when the equity markets continue to shrink and there's fewer and fewer things to buy, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2544.64s)]
*  prices will still go up irrespective of the underlying justification. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2549.52s)]
*  So I think that the thing is you can't look at these things as a sign per se. If you look at [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2553.68s)]
*  commodities as a different example, Nick, I sent you this, commodities are up broadly speaking, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2559.6s)]
*  30% since the beginning of the year. I think the reality is the following. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2565.84s)]
*  Countries are feeling increasingly uncomfortable with the decisions that the United States are [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2572.6400000000003s)]
*  making, whether that's its position to keep funding the war in Ukraine, whether that it's [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2580.56s)]
*  the continued instability in the Middle East, whether it's posturing with China, whatever it [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2586.6400000000003s)]
*  is. And so every country is now making a very different calculation about what they want to do. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2592.16s)]
*  And I think how it gets reflected is that they are optimizing for their own economies. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2596.72s)]
*  And what that yields is each of them trying to make as much money as they can in the short term. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2601.04s)]
*  And as a country that is a net importer, we are going to feel the price of those decisions [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2606.48s)]
*  as inflation. And I think Sachs is right. Like that's where we have to start figuring out how [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2612.72s)]
*  we rebalance these decisions from a foreign policy and economic perspective. Because if you [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2618.16s)]
*  don't change something here, all of these countries are basically going to be like, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2623.04s)]
*  we're on our own. We're going to optimize for ourselves. These countries are basically voting [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2626.3999999999996s)]
*  in a way that says we are not being led in a way that we trust. And that unfortunately falls at [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2632.3199999999997s)]
*  the feet of the sitting president. Yeah. Well, look, I'm hopeful, as we all are, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2636.56s)]
*  that work in the tech industry, that new tools and AI and other technologies would have a massive [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2643.36s)]
*  driver on productivity, which Net-Net could help even this out. That's the one last great hope. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2650.6400000000003s)]
*  Sitting here, AI obviously viewed as being highly disruptive by non-technologists and deeply [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2657.04s)]
*  concerning, and particularly in DC. What is that thing that Bill Gates says things are [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2663.92s)]
*  overestimated in the short term and deeply underestimated in the long term? I think that [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2669.92s)]
*  that's what AI is. That's right. That's right. And so AI is a bunch of, no offense, probabilities [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2673.92s)]
*  and statistics today. Okay? And so we talked about this last time. So we should debunk this whole [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2679.6800000000003s)]
*  thing of like, there's some glowing brain somewhere that's capable of doing everything. Doesn't mean [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2685.28s)]
*  that we shouldn't underestimate it being capable of this in five or 10 years, which is probably [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2690.6400000000003s)]
*  the window in which we have some form of AGI, but today it's not that. And so the great leaps [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2697.12s)]
*  in productivity, Freebird, that you're talking about are probably a three to five year phenomenon, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2702.0s)]
*  not a three to five month. So what Sack says is right, which is how does the sitting [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2706.0s)]
*  administration buy votes today? Stimulatory beheadings. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2711.3599999999997s)]
*  It'll have to make a ton of promises. The problem is it can't really work its way into the economy [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2714.56s)]
*  fast enough come the November election. And so that's where I think they're in a really tough [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2719.52s)]
*  spot, which means that then, and I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this is where [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2725.12s)]
*  you have a lot of these wag the dog kind of scenarios that come to mind, because then the [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2730.96s)]
*  only way to really galvanize a populace is to distract them. Yeah. Well, look, let's talk a [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2736.16s)]
*  little bit more about AI, because I do think that regardless of the near term and longer term [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2741.7599999999998s)]
*  implications, there is a peaking of fear, peaking of interest, both different spelling of the word [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2749.04s)]
*  peak. Adam Schiff yesterday proposed a bill, sorry, earlier this week called the Generative [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2755.44s)]
*  AI Copyright Disclosure Act in response to, I think over a hundred musicians signing a letter [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2761.44s)]
*  saying they're concerned that their copyrighted works are being used to train AI models. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2769.12s)]
*  And Nick, if you'll pull up the text from the bill that I pulled out here real quick, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2774.64s)]
*  we can take just a quick look. It's a very short bill. It's only five pages long, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2779.12s)]
*  and it defines a generative AI model that's a combination of computer code and numerical [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2784.16s)]
*  values designed to use artificial intelligence to generate outputs in the form of text, images, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2789.68s)]
*  audio or video, and that it substantially incorporates one or more models as a system. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2795.84s)]
*  And it's designed for use by consumers. And what the bill then asks is that anyone developing [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2802.4s)]
*  these models has to submit to a register run by the federal government, a list of all of the data [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2808.1600000000003s)]
*  that they used that might be copyrighted to train the model. And that this becomes a precursor to [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2816.0s)]
*  being able to legally develop and use AI models that you actually have to register the training [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2822.32s)]
*  data. So I have a rant on this, which I'm going to preserve for the end, given my rights [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2827.36s)]
*  as moderator here today, but I'd love the reaction from Sachs first on Schiff's proposed bill to [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2832.6400000000003s)]
*  Moth. And we'll run this one around the horn pretty quick. Well, first of all, I think it's [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2838.2400000000002s)]
*  too soon for this legislation. I mean, the first thing that needs to happen is we need to get the [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2843.2000000000003s)]
*  question of fair use arbitrated by the courts. We've talked about this before. People publish [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2847.84s)]
*  lots of information on the internet. And I guess technically it's copyrighted, but it's been [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2853.2s)]
*  published in a completely public way. And humans are obviously allowed to read it and use it to [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2858.8799999999997s)]
*  generate their own work. I think there's a question about whether AIs are allowed to learn from it as [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2864.96s)]
*  well. And I would argue that they should be to some degree under fair use. Maybe if you're talking [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2869.9199999999996s)]
*  about copyrighted songs, I don't know if that's different. Anyway, these questions need to be [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2876.3199999999997s)]
*  arbitrated. And once we know that, then we'll know whether there's a need for a rights clearinghouse [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2880.08s)]
*  of some kind, which may not be a bad idea. I actually got pitched by a founder recently to [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2886.96s)]
*  create a rights marketplace with copyright holders on the one side, or rights holders, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2892.96s)]
*  could be musicians, could be movie studios, could be anyone who owns content. And then AI companies [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2900.4s)]
*  on the other that want to license that content for training purposes. And I actually thought it [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2906.96s)]
*  was a pretty good idea. So my point is just that there are entrepreneurs working on solving this [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2911.68s)]
*  problem as well. And I guess what I'm saying is I'd like to see fair use figured out. And I'd like [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2918.2400000000002s)]
*  to see what the private solutions are going to be before we try to legislate this problem away from [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2923.76s)]
*  really a point of ignorance because we're so early in the development of this market. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2929.44s)]
*  Now, I think one of the questions you have to ask here is why did Adam Schiff introduce this bill? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2934.8s)]
*  And who is Adam Schiff? Adam Schiff is a powerful California congressman who is the candidate for [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2940.48s)]
*  US Senate right now. And he's expected to win. He's a head of Steve Garvey, who's the Republican [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2947.28s)]
*  candidate by like 30 points. Schiff is, in addition to being a vicious partisan who's known for [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2951.84s)]
*  Russiagate, he also is a prodigious fundraiser. And when he's not in front of the cameras, he's [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2960.4s)]
*  very effective in closed doors appealing to the key special interests in California that matter. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2967.44s)]
*  And my guess is that he's not carrying water here for the hundred musicians who signed that letter. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2974.08s)]
*  He's carrying water for the big studios, the big Hollywood studios, including music labels, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2978.56s)]
*  but also the movie studios. He's an LA based congressman. Yeah, I mean, that's who he's [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2984.2400000000002s)]
*  representing. Now at the same time, my guess is that he's run this by the big tech companies, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2989.6s)]
*  and he's probably got their blessing to some degree because like Bill Gurley always points out, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=2994.88s)]
*  they like rules like this because of regulatory capture. They can comply with them, but the little [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3000.4s)]
*  guy, the entrepreneur who's trying to create something new has a much harder time complying [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3004.56s)]
*  with these regulations. So this is basically a big special interest group sort of deal that I think [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3008.96s)]
*  he's putting forward. Do you think this becomes law? Not yet, but it's paving the way for something. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3016.8s)]
*  And it's more like his promotional effort during his campaign effectively. Well, I mean, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3022.64s)]
*  his- He'll still try to move it legislatively, but- [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3029.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the big LA powers that be like this and- [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3032.2400000000002s)]
*  They love this, yeah. Chamath, any reaction to this bill? [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3037.44s)]
*  Well, I think there was an article in The Verge that I posted. It turns out that OpenAI transcribed [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3042.24s)]
*  over a million hours of YouTube videos to train GPT-4. My takeaway when I read this was, well, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3051.3599999999997s)]
*  if Google's not going to sue OpenAI, then this is a moot point because you're talking about one of [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3058.64s)]
*  the most valuable companies in the world with one of the most valuable sources of training data in [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3066.56s)]
*  the world. And so if it's true that there was a copyright violation and Google just lets this go, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3071.28s)]
*  what's anybody else supposed to do? What chance does these group of singer songwriters have? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3079.6800000000003s)]
*  And no offense to Adam Schiff, but he's not going to be able to do anything. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3084.88s)]
*  So if this multi-trillion dollar company doesn't draw a line in the sand, then none of this matters [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3089.1200000000003s)]
*  and everybody's going to train on everything. I think my big takeaway on all this is that there's [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3095.92s)]
*  a real deep misunderstanding on what these models really are and what they're doing. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3103.76s)]
*  The assumption, I think, naively, is that they take in a bunch of data and then they spit that data [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3116.08s)]
*  back out. And in some cases, maybe slightly transformed. But the truth is that the models [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3123.36s)]
*  don't actually hold the data that they're trained on. They develop a bunch of synthesized predictors [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3131.1200000000003s)]
*  that they learn what the prediction could or should be from the data. And this is similar [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3139.84s)]
*  to how humans operate. Can you pull up the article, Nick, that I posted? This article is from last May [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3145.6s)]
*  and you guys may remember this case. I can't remember if we talked about it on the show, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3153.36s)]
*  but Ed Sheeran was sued by the estate of the writer of the Marvin Gaye song, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3158.0s)]
*  Let's Get It On, for infringement in his song, Thinking Out Loud. And he actually prevailed in [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3165.6s)]
*  court where he went through with the jury how he runs his creative process, how he came up with [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3172.8s)]
*  the song, and how he does his work. And as you know, Ed Sheeran and nearly every musician or every [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3179.52s)]
*  artist listens to other people's music, looks at other people's art, and they synthesize that data. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3186.48s)]
*  They synthesize that knowledge and that experience into their own creative process to output what, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3193.12s)]
*  in their mind, is a novel creation. And I think that AI works in a similar vein in that it's not [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3200.48s)]
*  actually storing the images, it's not actually storing the music of third parties. It's learning [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3207.52s)]
*  from that process. Musicians learn on classical music. They listen and play other pop artists' [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3213.12s)]
*  music. And then they learn things that they like, things that they don't like, things that [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3219.6s)]
*  fit together well, certain intonation, syncopations, and that's how they develop [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3224.16s)]
*  their own tracks. And so I think that the assumption in AI is that it's almost guilty [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3229.04s)]
*  until proven innocent is what's going to really challenge this technology getting mainstay appeal [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3235.68s)]
*  and being useful in the way that it could and should be. That the de facto is that it's learning [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3241.3599999999997s)]
*  and training is copyright infringement. I don't buy that. You don't buy that? No. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3247.7599999999998s)]
*  Let's use this. No, just because you're learning like a human, it's not copyright infringement. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3253.6s)]
*  I'm sorry, let me make my last statement, which is that I do think that similarity is measurable [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3260.7999999999997s)]
*  and that is copyright infringement. So I would rather than focus on how you train the model, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3265.36s)]
*  I would encourage legislators to find, as Sachs points out, a better process to define what makes [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3270.48s)]
*  one thing distinct from another, run that analysis, and then use that analysis to determine uniqueness. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3277.36s)]
*  And that analysis is ultimately what should determine whether there is copyright infringement [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3284.32s)]
*  versus the how was the model trained exercise, which is wrought with challenges, as you guys know. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3289.04s)]
*  How do you determine weightings? How do you determine whether this was even relevant in [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3294.56s)]
*  the model? We don't even know if the models ignore the data or use the data in their synthesis or in [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3297.6s)]
*  their weightings. It's all very opaque. And so it's almost like, hey, here's a list of stuff that I [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3302.96s)]
*  read, but I may not even have paid attention to 95% of it when I was reading it. We don't know. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3307.52s)]
*  And so I'd rather focus on is there copyright infringement in the output? Does the output [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3313.36s)]
*  mimic an original copyrighted source? And if it does, then that's where the infringement should [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3317.92s)]
*  lie. Not on the how did you do it? I think that you're creating an impossible standard. Is it 5% [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3323.92s)]
*  the same? Is it 8% the same? Is that 14%? Where's your threshold? Is it 78%? How's that different [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3328.56s)]
*  than training? If I'm JK Rowling, am I not allowed to read other authors copyrighted books for fear [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3334.64s)]
*  that by reading it, I will now use their copyrighted material in my novel book? No, okay, stick with [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3340.08s)]
*  that example. But we can also use the Ed Sheeran example. Nick, can you play this video? I could [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3346.0s)]
*  play you every song in the pop charts right now over four chords. You name any song and I'll play [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3349.92s)]
*  it in the four chords. So these are the chords. C, G, F, Messenger, your friend. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3354.08s)]
*  Let it be. I'm walking away, Craig David. Craig David. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3369.36s)]
*  I'm walking away from the troubles in my life. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3372.32s)]
*  Last one. Let it be. Beatles. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3377.36s)]
*  When I find myself in times of trouble. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3378.7200000000003s)]
*  Why is that important? Obviously, it's not illegal for Ed to have learned these four chords. But if [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3384.6400000000003s)]
*  he tries to produce those songs and calls them something else, that's clearly somebody else's IP. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3391.04s)]
*  Similarly, I think that if you don't give people the right to say, yeah, of course, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3396.4s)]
*  the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, all the way to Z are not my invention. It's the alphabet. I don't [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3401.36s)]
*  control that. I don't control words and their meanings. But when I put one word in front of [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3406.48s)]
*  another in front of another purposefully, and I create something that has value to me, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3410.48s)]
*  I should have the right to protect that. And I think that's the fundamental question. Should [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3415.2000000000003s)]
*  you not have a right to protect it? Should you allow somebody else to take that and in some opaque [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3419.1200000000003s)]
*  way, an undefinable way, make a system that could compete with that thing and have no repercussions? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3425.68s)]
*  I think that that's what people need to decide. And I'm fine, by the way, one way or the other. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3432.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. In the Ed Sheeran case, he was saying the exact copyrighted lyrics and he was singing the [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3436.56s)]
*  exact copyrighted melody. He was just playing the harmony with four chords. I mean, that was kind [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3442.56s)]
*  of the point he was making. And in the case of all the copyrighted material you're stating, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3447.2s)]
*  I want to protect it from showing up in the end product of someone's creative process. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3453.36s)]
*  I shouldn't care about them listening to my song in their creative process. Everyone always references [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3457.92s)]
*  how Oasis sounds like the Beatles, right? Those guys love the Beatles. They listen to the Beatles. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3461.92s)]
*  So much of their music mimics and sounds like the Beatles, but the Beatles aren't going to [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3466.32s)]
*  file infringement suits against them. They were inspired by the Beatles. That was part of their [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3470.0s)]
*  creative process. And so I would argue that the output should really be where we assess this stuff. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3473.84s)]
*  And it's going to take a lot of cases. You're creating an impossible standard where no [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3478.32s)]
*  individual person will have the economic wherewithal to fight this. And so it's basically seeding [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3483.3599999999997s)]
*  all creativity to the board. And I don't think that- [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3490.16s)]
*  What is the standard of measuring how someone is training their creative process? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3493.8399999999997s)]
*  Your standard is I got to go- I don't think this is a good- [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3498.3199999999997s)]
*  I got to go listen. You got to tell me every time you as an artist listen to a song, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3500.56s)]
*  and then I'm going to determine whether or not you are listening to copyright music and making your [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3505.2s)]
*  own music. That's basically what we're asking for here with this bill. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3510.4s)]
*  That's not what- I'm not talking about the bill. I'm talking about this idea that [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3513.52s)]
*  if you train a system that can actually automate a task for you based on some learning that's [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3517.6s)]
*  unique, you should be able to uniquely protect your ownership. For example, we have a different [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3522.96s)]
*  set of ways in order to protect processes that are unique to you, which is you can have a patent or [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3529.28s)]
*  you can have a trade secret. But if you strip all of this stuff away where some system can in an [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3534.1600000000003s)]
*  automated way do anything for you and replicate a whole bunch of work that it sits on top of to be [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3539.76s)]
*  able to do that without any repercussions, I think that that's a very important explicit decision. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3546.1600000000003s)]
*  And what I'm saying is you cannot expect individual people to go and fight these little [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3551.2000000000003s)]
*  battles against these big multi-hundred billion dollar companies. If the big multi-hundred [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3555.84s)]
*  billion dollar companies and trillion dollar companies don't fight the other multi-hundred [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3560.88s)]
*  billion dollar and trillion dollar companies, what they're effectively saying is none of this is [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3564.96s)]
*  worth anything. Copyrights are worth nothing. And I'm okay with that decision, but it should be an [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3568.96s)]
*  explicit one. And it's not going to happen the other way where some five page law from a guy [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3573.76s)]
*  who's trying to get elected is not the thing that's going to make the difference. The difference is, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3580.32s)]
*  if Google doesn't sue OpenAI, it means copyright is worthless. And by the way, that article didn't [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3584.56s)]
*  just point the finger at Google. It pointed the finger at Metta where there were explicit decisions [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3590.0s)]
*  to say, yeah, no, let's just violate the copyright. It's okay. And if it's okay, then it's okay. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3594.48s)]
*  Sacks, you're the independent arbiter here. Any summary? [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3599.28s)]
*  Well, somebody's going to litigate it. Somebody's going to litigate it. You're right. It'd be [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3605.36s)]
*  surprising if Google didn't want to, given how valuable their YouTube content is and a competitor [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3609.76s)]
*  slurped it up to train their model. But somebody will litigate this. It could be these songwriters, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3616.0s)]
*  who knows? And then we're going to get some messy arbitration around fair use. And it's [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3621.6s)]
*  probably going to work its way up over the different circuit courts. You'll probably get [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3626.96s)]
*  different judgments. And finally, this court will resolve it. And then we'll know where things stand [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3630.56s)]
*  and then there'll be a legislative fix. I don't know where it's going to end up. I know what [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3636.48s)]
*  JCal would say if he were here. I'm sure he's chomping at the bit part of this conversation. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3641.92s)]
*  He would say that creators deserve to get paid for their AI rights and that if you want to make [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3646.72s)]
*  money training a model on their content, you got to compensate them. I also buy your argument too, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3653.2799999999997s)]
*  which is you're not really violating their rights for the AI model to read their content and analyze [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3660.0s)]
*  it, which is what it's really doing, as long as it doesn't output a violation of their copyright. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3670.0s)]
*  And that's what all artists do. That's what all humans do. The creative process is one of initially [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3675.84s)]
*  synthesis. You learn from other people's works. You learn from the environment around you. You [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3682.6400000000003s)]
*  learn from the world that you're exposed to. But there was compensation in those other models. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3687.36s)]
*  There was not. Look, Oasis never paid the Beatles to listen to their music. They bought an album. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3691.04s)]
*  No, but the radios, no, that's not true. They listened on the radio. They may not have paid, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3696.88s)]
*  but some advertiser paid for an ad. The radio station had to pay ASCAP and BMI. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3700.96s)]
*  There was publishing rights. There was all kinds of other rights. So that's not true what you're [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3706.08s)]
*  saying. What I'm saying is it's not copyright just because I trained my process. My point is somebody [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3710.0s)]
*  got paid. So that singer songwriter did get paid. They may not have gotten paid by the listener, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3714.32s)]
*  but in this example, nobody's getting paid. Look, I think there's three potential outcomes here. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3719.04s)]
*  Outcome number one is that Freeberg wins and the courts decide that this is fair use. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3724.08s)]
*  And these AI companies aren't in violation of rights. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3730.56s)]
*  And copyright infringement is measured in the work of art that is produced, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3733.28s)]
*  not in the process by which it is generated. Right. Okay. So that's solution number one. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3737.04s)]
*  I think solution or outcome number two is that the courts throw a big wrench into it or a bill [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3742.0s)]
*  like Schist's bill, which is largely punitive, throws a big wrench into it. And I think what [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3748.64s)]
*  happens then is new AI companies have a really hard time accumulating training data. And so the [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3753.36s)]
*  incumbents who already have all the training data, they may have to pay a fine. There'll be [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3759.36s)]
*  some slap on the wrist, but now you've created a real moat and barrier to entry. And so secretly, [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3763.76s)]
*  they're going to love it. And it's going to be a big problem, I think, for the open source movement. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3768.56s)]
*  So that's outcome number two. And then outcome number three is you create some sort of rights [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3772.48s)]
*  clearinghouse, kind of like exists in the recording industry, where if you want to cover somebody's [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3778.88s)]
*  song or perform somebody else's song, there's already predefined terms on which you can [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3785.52s)]
*  use those rights. And then there's a compensation mechanism for that. So you don't have to go [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3790.56s)]
*  negotiate every single deal that you want to do. You can just use the song, you can use the rights, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3795.44s)]
*  and there's again, compensation for that. That would be like the compromise. I could see that [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3800.64s)]
*  alternative number three existing, in which case the incumbents probably like that because they, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3805.44s)]
*  again, they want there to be a barrier to entry. They want to make it hard for the guy in the [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3811.92s)]
*  garage to pony up the capital necessary to create a new model. But at least that would be a somewhat [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3816.64s)]
*  functional system. It wouldn't be outcome number two, which would totally put the kibosh on the [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3823.6s)]
*  use of training data. So in any event, I don't know which one of the three it's going to be, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3828.64s)]
*  but those are the three potential outcomes that I see happening here. Have you guys seen UDio? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3832.16s)]
*  UDio? No, it's like a new music gen AI system. It is friggin unbelievable. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3836.24s)]
*  Is that Vinod Singh or Vinod's another thing? I think Vinod's another thing. This one just came [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3847.6s)]
*  out. It was apparently rumored for a while. X Deep Mind employees started UDio. It's been this [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3852.16s)]
*  kind of like hot stealth company for a couple of months. People have been talking about it as [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3857.9199999999996s)]
*  rumored to be the best music AI. But here is someone that said Dune the Broadway musical. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3865.2s)]
*  And this is what it output. Go ahead. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3871.2s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3888.0s)]
*  You can hear the layers of music, the layers of the tracks, the smoothness, the tempo. Obviously, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3888.88s)]
*  there's just so many layers to this. Nick, can you pull up another one? Some of these are just [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3896.0s)]
*  incredible because it spans genres. It spans styles. It's so beautiful the way it's put [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3899.6800000000003s)]
*  together. Every piece feels somewhat emotional. It's unique. It really doesn't feel like you're [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3906.8s)]
*  just listening to someone printing copyright music. Funky dance pop song. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3912.48s)]
*  Create a birthday song for my friend Urban. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3923.76s)]
*  Create an Irish folk tune with violin and instrumental. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3931.04s)]
*  It's pretty incredible. And I think it shows the state of the art is such now that this is [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3942.56s)]
*  going to become a real challenging question from a legislative point of view, given how far ahead [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3950.08s)]
*  these technologies have gotten. And I think that musicians, artists, consumers are going to start [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3956.4s)]
*  to use these tools in a really prolific way, given how good they are now. I heard from someone that [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3960.72s)]
*  just sat for hours creating tracks that they listened to on UDO the other day. And so you [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3967.12s)]
*  basically just playing your own music all day long. It's really incredible. Anyway, exciting time. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3972.48s)]
*  Hopefully all the lawsuits and the legislators don't get in the way of all this innovation [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3977.44s)]
*  because it's moving really fast and we should just kind of see where it goes before trying to [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3981.44s)]
*  clamp down on it. Totally. Guys, I want to talk about, as you know, this emerging friend that [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3985.2799999999997s)]
*  we've been talking about offline about drones in warfare. Recently we saw small drones controlled [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3992.0s)]
*  by the Houthis attack cargo vessels in the Suez Canal. It led to rather large scale supply [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=3997.52s)]
*  disruptions, economic value destruction. We've seen videos, Saks, I think you have one. We can [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4003.2s)]
*  pull it up and take a look of Ukrainian controlled drones flying in to destroy tanks and large [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4008.64s)]
*  warehouses in Russian held territories, causing tens of millions of dollars of damage. I think [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4014.56s)]
*  we're seeing the acceleration of the changing face of warfare technology, lots of these small [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4019.36s)]
*  form factor, low cost, autonomous physical agents. And I think there's a bunch of implications both [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4023.6800000000003s)]
*  with respect to war, but also how we spend money on defense and how Silicon Valley is involved in [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4029.84s)]
*  response. Saks, I'd love to hear your points of view. Maybe you can highlight for us some of the [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4036.2400000000002s)]
*  things you've been seeing in the utilization of these new technologies in the war, given you're [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4040.56s)]
*  our in-house war correspondent. And you obviously do some work in Silicon Valley. Go ahead. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4046.0s)]
*  I've heard a lot about the impact of drones just by watching the coverage of the Ukraine war. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4051.76s)]
*  I was listening to an interview with an American mercenary who's fighting on the side of Ukraine, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4057.84s)]
*  and he described how ubiquitous these drones were on the battlefield. Now he said that you literally [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4062.96s)]
*  can't get out of a trench to go to the bathroom because a drone will basically get you. And he [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4068.32s)]
*  said they're buzzing around, they sound like mosquitoes because they're just everywhere on [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4073.92s)]
*  the battlefield. Both Ukraine and Russia have them. And several months ago, going into this year, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4078.0s)]
*  Zelensky said that this would be the big game changer for Ukraine. They're going to make a [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4085.44s)]
*  million drones. I don't think it's worked out that way. It turns out that as many drones as [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4088.56s)]
*  Ukrainians have been able to put on the battlefield, the Russians have even more, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4092.96s)]
*  because they're able to mass produce them in factories. They've got bigger drones, better [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4096.88s)]
*  drones. And I think the most important variable in the war so far with respect to drones is that [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4101.36s)]
*  the Russians have pretty advanced electronic warfare. And so they've been able to jam a lot [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4106.88s)]
*  of the Ukrainian drones, whereas the reverse has not been true for the Ukrainians. So I would say [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4112.24s)]
*  that drones have been a huge factor in the war, but so far the balance there is tipping towards [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4118.639999999999s)]
*  the Russians as it is in so many other areas as well. But to your larger point, there's no [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4125.12s)]
*  question this is the future of warfare. And you're seeing that it's creating a lot of opportunities [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4130.64s)]
*  for asymmetric warfare. So for example, with the Houthis, they've been firing cheap missiles and [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4137.6s)]
*  drones at our ships in the Red Sea. And we've been having to spend $2 million air defense missiles [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4144.72s)]
*  shooting down $2,000 drones. So if that continues and we don't have a good response to this problem, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4151.52s)]
*  it's going to really change the balance of power. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4157.12s)]
*  I don't know if this was at our summit or if I heard this later from some senior person in the [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4158.96s)]
*  military who said that aircraft carriers are outdated technology, like they don't make sense [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4163.28s)]
*  anymore. And we're going to see a shift towards lots of small, autonomous drone-like systems on [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4168.24s)]
*  the battlefield taking out targets. And as a result, if you gain theory this out, the necessity [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4176.96s)]
*  for defense systems against large amounts of swarming drone-like systems, and then, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4182.96s)]
*  you know, what do you actually have to do with your existing military architecture to play [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4188.64s)]
*  into this kind of new tactical system? And then that's going to require a massive evolution in [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4195.84s)]
*  technology. And is the United States prepared? That should Silicon Valley play? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4202.0s)]
*  Should be. We should. Maybe, Nick, you can throw up this the first link that I sent you. But eight [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4207.92s)]
*  years ago, I came to this conclusion and I invested in this company called Sail Drone, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4214.16s)]
*  which is autonomous drones in the seas. Our customers include the US Navy, the chairman [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4219.2s)]
*  of our company actually is Admiral Mike Mullen, who is the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4224.24s)]
*  of Staff. But these drones are capable of going into some of the most dangerous places in the [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4228.32s)]
*  world and collecting enormous amounts of surveillance data and information that otherwise takes [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4234.16s)]
*  the United States government lots of time and lots of money and is pretty scattershot. And [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4242.32s)]
*  instead with these things, you can be constantly in hotspots. And if you go to the next one, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4248.08s)]
*  so much so that, you know, we've deployed some of these drones in the Middle East and there was a [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4254.8s)]
*  point at which the Iranian Navy intercepted two of our drones and picked them up. And this was kind [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4260.08s)]
*  of like a global thing a few years ago. But I really believe in this trend. And I think that [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4264.32s)]
*  we have an enormous responsibility to be funding these things. These are really complicated systems [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4269.759999999999s)]
*  to build, obviously, and they take lots of time. So these are not overnight successes, Friedberg, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4275.84s)]
*  and they take lots of money, which is hard to come by as well. But these are absolutely the right [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4280.48s)]
*  kinds of businesses because eventually, at a minimum, you're building systems that can [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4285.04s)]
*  measure and collect enormous amounts of really critical data so that people can make better [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4289.84s)]
*  decisions, which hopefully is measured in saving life, right? And then over time, you actually get [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4294.8s)]
*  to a military that should be much cheaper, much safer, and has fewer people in general on our side [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4302.08s)]
*  and on our enemy sides on the front lines, which means fewer casualties. And I think that that's [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4309.28s)]
*  the whole value of this entire movement. It's cheaper, it's way better, it's much more useful, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4315.2s)]
*  and it gives the respective armies that use these things, or militaries rather, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4321.679999999999s)]
*  a fuller picture so that you can make decisions that have enormous consequences. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4326.8s)]
*  Yeah, and in February, the Department of Defense on a panel in Arlington, Virginia, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4330.639999999999s)]
*  briefed reporters and industry folks on their interest in growing their partnerships in Silicon [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4337.36s)]
*  Valley to access the necessary technologies that are going to rewrite the face of warfare. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4343.28s)]
*  I don't know about you guys, but I've seen kind of two sides of this in Silicon Valley. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4350.72s)]
*  A good number of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs and technologists think that [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4356.4800000000005s)]
*  it's morally incorrect to support warfare technology. And then there are a few that are [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4361.4400000000005s)]
*  going blazing ahead with supporting this new evolution and these technologies. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4367.52s)]
*  Do you guys see the same? And is there going to be kind of this? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4372.400000000001s)]
*  It's a big step to weaponize these things, right? So, SailDrone, we have a very good, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4375.04s)]
*  big, thriving, successful business. These machines aren't weaponized by any stretch [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4380.64s)]
*  of the imagination. And so, I think that that [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4385.28s)]
*  comment is more genuflecting and virtue signaling than it is real. Because in order to even be [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4390.72s)]
*  legitimately considered for some kind of armed, unmanned product, you have to be deep inside of [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4398.96s)]
*  the bowels of the DOD and Pentagon and have been working with them for years to even be taken [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4407.12s)]
*  seriously. So, the startups that are like eschewing those deals are not even close to those deals. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4412.48s)]
*  And the startups that are close to them are probably being much more quiet and thoughtful [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4418.4s)]
*  and hush-hush because the path to do that isn't legitimate unless you've been in business with [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4423.04s)]
*  these folks for 10 plus years. Yeah, I think it's more commentary on the fact that if this is where [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4427.76s)]
*  an organization, the Department of Defense, that has a trillion-dollar annual budget [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4435.2s)]
*  is going to be allocating resources, that technology is going to need to come from somewhere. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4440.08s)]
*  And the investors in Silicon Valley that are making these investments are likely going to [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4446.72s)]
*  outperform those who are not. Does that sound reasonable to you, Sax, that there is this shift [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4451.6s)]
*  underway and that, again, those who have shied away from defense technology are necessarily [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4456.72s)]
*  going to be left out of a new industry that's emerging in Silicon Valley? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4463.68s)]
*  Well, I guess the way I put it is that the US government spends over $800 billion [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4468.88s)]
*  every year on defense and it's not clear what we're getting for that money because [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4473.76s)]
*  in Ukraine, for example, we've run out of artillery shells. We've actually run out of [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4478.8s)]
*  Patriots. We've run out of Javelins. We've run out of Stingers. So, we're spending all this money. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4482.240000000001s)]
*  We're not getting a lot for it. And part of the reason is because the defense industry is [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4486.320000000001s)]
*  consolidated down to these five prime defense contractors who are basically in oligopoly. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4490.32s)]
*  And we have this cost plus procurement system where they just raise their prices every year [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4497.04s)]
*  and the government pays it. So, I think all of us want the United States to have an effective [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4500.96s)]
*  defense. I mean, I want us to use our military power more wisely. I don't like all these stupid [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4507.36s)]
*  wars we keep getting in, but I do want the United States as an American to be the most powerful [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4511.12s)]
*  country. I do want us to get the best value for our defense dollars. And the only way that's [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4516.32s)]
*  going to change is if the defense industry gets disrupted by a bunch of startups doing innovative [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4523.92s)]
*  things. And there's no question that I think drones are the future of warfare. To your point [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4529.599999999999s)]
*  about autonomy, I think that is where this is going next is that right now the drones are [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4535.2s)]
*  typically controlled by somebody with a VR headset. They're called teleoperated. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4540.8s)]
*  Teleoperated and they're FPV, this first person vision drone. And you basically strap [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4547.04s)]
*  some sort of explosive onto it and then you drive it into whatever your target is. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4554.56s)]
*  Yeah. Those types of drones are easier to disrupt by electronic warfare because if you can disrupt [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4558.8s)]
*  the signal from the teleoperator, then the drone basically doesn't know what to do. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4565.76s)]
*  And so you're right. The next step here is autonomous systems that can be programmed with [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4571.4400000000005s)]
*  a target and can find it on its own, make decisions on its own. And then they also build in some [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4578.64s)]
*  shielding against some of this jamming technology or this EW, electronic warfare technology. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4584.400000000001s)]
*  So that's where all these things, that's where the battlefield of the future is headed. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4591.12s)]
*  And in a weird way, if you think about humans becoming a smaller and smaller piece of the [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4596.0s)]
*  battlefield and autonomous drones becoming a larger and larger piece of it, these wars become [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4601.76s)]
*  resource wars and basically technology wars, which may or may not be good. I don't know. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4608.08s)]
*  But by the way, so this is the point I wanted to make. If you pull up this chart, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4613.68s)]
*  if that is where warfare is headed, is a large number of small autonomous systems that go and [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4617.04s)]
*  find a target and try and execute a mission. And in the case of Ukraine saying they want to have a [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4624.08s)]
*  million, China might say, I want to have a hundred million. All of these systems are dependent on [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4629.6s)]
*  lithium ion battery systems. Today, 79% of lithium ion battery production comes out of China. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4635.12s)]
*  The U.S. is only 6.2% of global lithium ion battery production. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4640.72s)]
*  And China has talked about scaling up drone manufacturing to a level that the U.S. simply [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4645.2s)]
*  cannot even contemplate in its industrial architecture today. So it seems to me that [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4651.44s)]
*  if that is where warfare tactically is headed, that China has a huge leg up and is going to [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4658.32s)]
*  become a critical point of dependency for the United States to develop an arsenal [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4664.56s)]
*  necessary to be competitive in this next evolution of warfare. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4670.080000000001s)]
*  I will say that if you then game theory this out, how do you defend against these autonomous [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4674.96s)]
*  electronic systems? There's a technology called EMP or electromagnetic pulsing, where as you guys [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4679.92s)]
*  know, if you run a very high current electric field, you can actually send out and emit a pulse [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4686.56s)]
*  that then when it hits electronic circuits far away, induces a high electric current in those [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4692.4s)]
*  circuits and short circuits them. So EMPs are a defense system that allow you to take out [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4698.0s)]
*  electronic systems. And this has been kind of a part of warfare since probably the 1960s, 50s, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4705.04s)]
*  but targeted EMPs and targeted systems for eliminating all of these autonomous systems [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4711.839999999999s)]
*  becomes a new defense technology that I know several startups in Silicon Valley that have [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4716.08s)]
*  been funded with a lot of capital by folks that we all know very well that are kind of pursuing this. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4722.8s)]
*  We don't have a choice because I think the point is that if you just, Nick, you just post this [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4728.32s)]
*  photo, we have an enormous human capital problem with the military, which is there's just not [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4732.96s)]
*  enough folks enlisting anymore. So we don't have any choice except to automate and become [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4737.44s)]
*  drone dependent. Just tell us these numbers, Shima. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4742.88s)]
*  This is a chart from the Department of Defense that shows military enlistments looking back [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4745.44s)]
*  from about the 1970s through today. And these are two lines that are just going from the upper left [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4749.919999999999s)]
*  to the lower right. And so we're at all time lows with respect to the number of people that actually [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4757.36s)]
*  want to join the military. And so if we are supposed to, as Zach said, be this very sharp [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4762.32s)]
*  fighting force, then all of the money that we're spending needs to get allocated into things that [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4770.32s)]
*  can be remotely operated. We don't have a choice. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4774.32s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, so Freeberg, you asked the question, how do we defend against these drones? Yes, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4778.48s)]
*  there's EMP technology. If you want to use an EMP, you better make sure there's not any planes [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4783.5199999999995s)]
*  nearby because it will take them out of the sky. You better make sure. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4788.5599999999995s)]
*  By the way, there are now, you can target EMPs in a narrow cone, which is part of the technology. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4791.2s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you better make sure you don't hit any of your own stuff because you'll fry [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4796.4s)]
*  the electronics on those unless you EMP harden them, which by the way will happen. I mean, if [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4799.36s)]
*  the US gets really good at sending out EMP pulses, then our opponents will start EMP [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4804.16s)]
*  hardening their drones. But anyway, yes, it's a category of defense. So is electronic warfare. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4809.839999999999s)]
*  The one defense investment I've made is actually in this idea of how do you defend against drones. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4816.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's a startup where I led the Sea Ground called Allen Control Systems. And they have a [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4822.24s)]
*  product called Bullfrog, which is a gun turret that uses a standard M240 machine gun. But it's got [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4826.24s)]
*  a scanner next to it, next to the machine gun that is searching the sky for enemy drones. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4833.599999999999s)]
*  And it uses computer vision to recognize them. And then it just shoots them down very quickly. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4840.48s)]
*  And it seems to me this is maybe not the only way of doing it, but it's a really good way of doing [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4846.0s)]
*  it because you can mount these things to a vehicle. I mean, imagine in the future [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4850.879999999999s)]
*  that we have these autonomous drones everywhere that are basically assassination drones. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4858.879999999999s)]
*  How are you going to stop them? I mean, how do you move the president of the United States around? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4863.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, in his caravan, you're going to have to have, you know, his caravan is going to have to [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4866.639999999999s)]
*  have some sort of electronic warfare system on it to basically protect drones. But it's going to [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4871.599999999999s)]
*  need some sort of last line of defense where you can actually shoot a drone out of the sky. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4879.44s)]
*  Or he stays in his basement. So, Sax, you don't have any moral [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4883.44s)]
*  trepidation around investing in defense technology, just to be clear. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4887.44s)]
*  Well, you know, I'd have to think twice about investing in a weapon. This is more of a defense [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4890.88s)]
*  technology. This is defensive in nature where you're trying to take out a drone that would [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4895.52s)]
*  be attacking one of our bases or installations or convoys. So this is fundamentally defensive in [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4899.84s)]
*  nature. And look, I want America to be the most powerful country. I'm an American, I'm patriotic. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4906.4800000000005s)]
*  So I don't want our troops to be hit by enemy drones. So no, I don't have any moral problem [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4912.96s)]
*  with this. I do have a problem with all the stupid wars the United States gets into. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4919.2s)]
*  But that's on a policy level. I feel like that's separate from the question of do we want our guys [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4924.24s)]
*  to be protected? Yes, we do. And Shumoff, you don't care you would invest in defense technology [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4929.679999999999s)]
*  companies. No, I care. I think that I would probably have to think twice about making weapons. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4934.32s)]
*  I'm not sure that I'm really interested in that. But like I said, eight years ago, my thought was [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4938.88s)]
*  we need to move to just looking at both trends, we need to move to an entire surface area of [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4943.2s)]
*  unmanned autonomous vehicles. And I really liked this idea of a class of machine that's there to [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4948.64s)]
*  surveil and collect all the important data so that you can make better decisions. And [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4956.320000000001s)]
*  it's taken us eight years, but we're firmly entrenched now. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4961.360000000001s)]
*  I think the fact that both of you highlighted degree of trepidation, and you guys are [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4964.56s)]
*  like fairly outside of the middle bounds of how Silicon Valley would think and make decisions [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4969.84s)]
*  indicates like why so much of Silicon Valley has deep concerns about investing in defense technology. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4975.84s)]
*  And the US despite having the best technology may be challenged by the fact that our Silicon Valley [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4981.2s)]
*  technologists and investors are held back on pursuing these evolutions because of a moral [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4989.28s)]
*  suasion. And I think it is something that the Department of Defense has highlighted is that [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=4998.8s)]
*  I want to hear though, it's never like we've been faced with that choice. And the reality is like, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5003.36s)]
*  if the choice is stay small, or scale up and be really big, it's hard to turn away from that [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5008.64s)]
*  decision. But that choice isn't a realistic one. This is why I was saying I think it's, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5018.0s)]
*  you can come into it with the moral framing. But I do think that Sachs is right, which is, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5022.96s)]
*  if you believe that America should be the most important country in the world, then you have [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5027.4400000000005s)]
*  the ability to help it be that eventually some of those decisions will come in contact with this [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5031.52s)]
*  kind of decision. And usually though, it takes many, many years before that's realistic. And [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5039.68s)]
*  to be honest, from what I've seen, the opportunity to pursue that is generally so financially [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5045.84s)]
*  remunerative that everybody's like, Okay, I think we have to do it. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5054.88s)]
*  I don't have a problem with investing in a company like Androl. I mean, America needs [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5057.92s)]
*  defense companies in order to maintain its defense. And the problem right now that we have is there's [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5062.240000000001s)]
*  these five prime companies that are antiquated and really expensive. And we need startup disruptors [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5067.120000000001s)]
*  to that. So I'm not morally opposed to it. And in fact, I think it's probably a good thing. I think [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5074.160000000001s)]
*  my concern would be, I don't really want to be part of the military industrial complex. I feel like it [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5078.8s)]
*  might like corrupt my views on things. Like I don't want to feel- [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5083.52s)]
*  No, you'd want war. You'd be girding for war. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5088.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Like I don't want to feel an incentive. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5090.080000000001s)]
*  Because that's your dimension. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5092.72s)]
*  That's right. I don't want to feel an incentive to be like these generals who go on CNN and [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5094.400000000001s)]
*  Fox News and justify every single war. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5098.8s)]
*  That's my biggest fear as well. It's like, it's one thing to be investing in a bunch of companies [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5101.84s)]
*  where we're sitting around hoping for cheaper clicks on Facebook and Google. It's an entirely [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5105.76s)]
*  other thing to sit on the board of a company and hope for war. That's a horrible place to be in. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5111.2s)]
*  On that point, that's a great point to wrap on. Guys, this has been fun. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZp80SYIRlY&t=5115.44s)]
