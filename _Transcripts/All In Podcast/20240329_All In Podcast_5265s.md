# E172 SBF gets 25 years, Trump's meme stock, RFK Jr picks VP, Biden's 2025 budget & more
**All In Podcast:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw)
*  Nat and I have goals when I play poker. She always leaves me with the following. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=0.0s)]
*  Play well. Check. Have fun. Check. Do not eat late at night. Never a check. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=5.68s)]
*  Not a chance. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=12.8s)]
*  As soon as we finish dinner within 20 minutes back at the poker table, Timothee's like, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=13.84s)]
*  may I have my Haagen-Dazs now? May I have my second Haagen-Dazs now? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  Hellmuth, you are buying the melts tonight. Hellmuth, fire up the cheeseburger melts. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=23.12s)]
*  Did you see? Freeberg, you should have seen last week. Hellmuth at the dinner table. Sean made some [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=28.0s)]
*  incredible, I thought, fresh sorbet of some fruit or whatever. He at the dinner table [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=33.92s)]
*  ordered from DoorDash double stuffed Oreos, some Nutter butters, some cherry beets. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=40.0s)]
*  Nutter butters. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=46.24s)]
*  They arrived when we left dinner and got back to the poker room. It was so disgusting. And then [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=47.6s)]
*  the next day, my whole household, everybody, Nat, the kids are like, what are these things? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=53.12s)]
*  They were holding up these Nutter butters. They were looking at them like they've never seen [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=58.16s)]
*  a Nutter butter. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=61.36s)]
*  The best part about Phil Hellmuth's DoorDash addiction is that at least once a month, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  Chamath would be like, somebody ordered four entrees, pastas, and two desserts to my house, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=69.6s)]
*  and I didn't order it. And it feels like, oh, that's me on the group jet. That's me. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=78.32s)]
*  Because he doesn't take the time to change his address back to his house. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=82.96s)]
*  And then you see the naked truth of what he's ordering. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=87.04s)]
*  One person who's not going to be eating well is SBF. He was just sentenced. Breaking News Thursdays [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=89.6s)]
*  continues here at the All In Podcast, episode 172. But SBF was just sentenced with me again [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=114.0s)]
*  today on the pod. Of course, the dictator chairman, Chamath Palihapitiya, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=121.52s)]
*  Sultan of Science David Friberg, and the Rain Man, yeah, David Sacks. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=125.52s)]
*  I'm Jason Callicannis. Welcome back to the number one podcast in the world, episode 172, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=131.52s)]
*  the All In Podcast, your favorite. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=137.84s)]
*  SBF, just sentenced 25 years. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=140.88s)]
*  You're always overhyping. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=143.36s)]
*  Always. Hype man. It's always what I do. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. I'm a hype man. I'm like flavor flay of this organization. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=147.68s)]
*  SBF, Sam Bankman Fried of FTX, was found guilty, as you know, a couple of months ago in November, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  and he just got sentenced to 25 years. In total, FTX customers lost 8 billion, investors lost 1.7 [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  billion, and lenders lost 1.3 billion. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=168.96s)]
*  Is that without parole? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=171.12s)]
*  When is he eligible for parole? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=173.44000000000003s)]
*  So that is a good question. It doesn't say what the parole could be. The prosecutors said- [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  There's no possibility of parole in federal criminal cases. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=182.72000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. So federal prosecutors start 40 to 50 years. So the judge went a little bit light, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  I guess, and gave half. In his sentencing, Judge Louis Kaplan said SBF had lied throughout the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  trial and showed no remorse. Quote, he knew it was wrong. He knew it was criminal. He regrets [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=197.6s)]
*  that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood of getting caught, but he is not going to admit [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=203.68s)]
*  a thing, as is his right. In related news, FTX is also selling the majority of its stake in [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=209.12s)]
*  Anthropic for 884 million to Mubadala, one of the sovereign wealth funds from the UAE, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=214.48s)]
*  and other investors, including Jane Street, where SBF worked for a hot minute. The Ford Foundation, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=220.72s)]
*  Fidelity, and some other investors from CNBC, lawyers representing the bankruptcy estate told [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=226.48s)]
*  the judge in Delaware last month that they expect to fully repay customers and creditors with [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=232.48s)]
*  legitimate claims in the FTX case. That doesn't take into account equity holders. So it looks [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=237.83999999999997s)]
*  like that one investment could save a lot of people their deposits. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  I saw an analysis recently that showed that they were going to be in a surplus. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  Investors were going to get money back and all the depositors were going to get their full 100% [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=253.60000000000002s)]
*  back. Yeah, I don't know how much Bitcoin or other coins they owned, but if they didn't sell [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=257.92s)]
*  Bitcoin at 30 or 40 and it's at 60 or 70 now, yeah, that would be material, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=263.2s)]
*  The crazy thing is that SBF was not, it turns out, a terrible investor. He made a seed investment [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=268.32s)]
*  in Anthropic that's worth billions now. He made a seed investment in Solana that I think is worth [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=273.52000000000004s)]
*  billions now, especially now that Solana has recovered. I think that Solana was hard with the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=279.6s)]
*  brush of being a Sam coin because SBF invested in it. But as it turns out, as far as we know, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=285.04s)]
*  it's a completely legitimate developer project. Sam was an investor, but not a participant. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  And you look at the price of it, it's now rallied to something like an $80 billion market cap. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  The point being that a lot of the investments he made ended up being pretty good investments. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  And FTX itself, the trading platform, as far as we know, was a functional workable business. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=305.12s)]
*  It was an offshore crypto marketplace, so I don't want to necessarily use the word legitimate, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=315.28000000000003s)]
*  but I think that it was, I think, as good as any of these trading platforms. So the crazy part of [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=319.68s)]
*  this is I'd say, unlike the Madoff case, where from the beginning with Madoff, it was entirely [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=325.12s)]
*  a Ponzi scheme. There was nothing of value there. In this case, you had a, call it legitimate or [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=330.88s)]
*  semi-legitimate crypto platform combined with some legitimate angel investments. And so what [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=337.2s)]
*  I think went wrong here was Alameda, that Sam decided to siphon off customer deposits to gamble [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=345.52s)]
*  with his hedge fund, which was completely optional. He didn't need to do that. I mean, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=351.68s)]
*  he already had a winning business and winning bets in his portfolio. So this whole Alameda thing, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=356.0s)]
*  he didn't need to get into. And then of course, siphoning off customer deposits to spray around [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=362.32s)]
*  for political donations to feel like you're a big shot was also really stupid. So this is the crazy [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=366.48s)]
*  thing I think about SBF is it was sort of like this manic. There was like a manic element to it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=372.24s)]
*  There was a messianic element to it. He wanted to take shortcuts. He wanted to believe he was going [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=379.6s)]
*  to save the world and then did all these criminal things in pursuit of that, that he didn't really [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=385.52s)]
*  need to in order to be successful. And that's why I think it's such a curious case is it's not, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=390.0s)]
*  it wasn't full Madoff in a way, because there were some legitimate elements to his portfolio. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  You're right about the messianic thing. These guys were all drunk on this effective altruism [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=403.03999999999996s)]
*  concept that I think whatever crimes they committed by stealing the deposits and then [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=406.88s)]
*  going and investing them, they saw themselves as Robin Hood. We're going to take these deposits. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=412.8s)]
*  We're going to make a ton of money and then we're going to give it all away. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=417.04s)]
*  Of course, they didn't have a CFO. Nobody did diligence on these investments. There were no [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=420.32s)]
*  controls in place. And he was literally stealing his customers money to gamble. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=424.08s)]
*  I sure said. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=428.72s)]
*  And I think, I think actually one, one quote that I saw reported from the judge was that if you steal [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=429.68s)]
*  customers money, go to Vegas, gamble it, you're still guilty even if you can pay them back with [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=437.28s)]
*  the winnings. But that suggests to me that actually the FTX trustee is on a path to repaying the 11 [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=443.52s)]
*  billion of customer deposits that were absconded with. I don't know if that's true or not. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=452.4s)]
*  It is true. In early February, the trustee said they now expect 100% [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=457.67999999999995s)]
*  payment back to the depositors and all the accounts and all the excess will go to the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  shareholders and FTX, all the preferred holders that invested in the stock. I don't know what the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=467.28s)]
*  total press stack was in FTX, but it sounds like there's going to be recovery there as well. After [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  all of the customer deposits are made whole. Wow. So this is my point is he didn't need to do this. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=476.96s)]
*  I mean, it was so insane. I mean, FTX, like I said, was a workable business. He made workable [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=481.84s)]
*  seed bets, but then he went crazy with Alameda and the Robinhood stuff. So this is such an [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=489.28s)]
*  interesting case. By the way, Sax, Alameda is what he started with. So he started a firm that [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=495.44s)]
*  was meant to arbitrage crypto markets because there's all these different markets that didn't [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=500.64s)]
*  connect around the world. So the original concept was that he would set up a hedge fund like a Jane [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=504.08s)]
*  Street to arbitrage. So he would arbitrage crypto pairs using different exchanges around the world. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  He set up all these different accounts and he would trade long one way, short the other way. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=514.64s)]
*  And make a spread. And then he made so much money on the hedge fund. And he said, why don't we just [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=518.24s)]
*  do this all centrally? And that's how he started setting up FTX was his own cryptocurrency exchange. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=523.84s)]
*  So like the legacy was that Alameda was there from the beginning and the arbitrage across these [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=529.92s)]
*  illiquid, no transparency type markets was really the core driving principle when he started all [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=534.72s)]
*  this work. The crypto exchange came later. And so it was like he always had this orientation that [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=539.84s)]
*  he was trying to arb everything. And I think I told you guys this when I saw that video on YouTube, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=545.04s)]
*  right after he got arrested and then they took it down off of YouTube. It was like an hour long [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=550.8s)]
*  video showing him trading and doing his day job in the office. It reminded me of like a mouse in a [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=555.28s)]
*  maze, like chronic, like everything was like art. Like he was finding little arms he could make [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=562.16s)]
*  everywhere nonstop. They lost a ton of money. And then he lost money. Yeah. And then he puts this [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=566.56s)]
*  dingbat in charge of Alameda who proceeds to lose billions of dollars. I mean, the whole thing was [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=572.08s)]
*  so stupid. I mean, it's going to be such a great movie. I can't wait for the movie. I think one of [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=579.0400000000001s)]
*  the craziest parts of this is he had co-founders in FTX who weren't part of Alameda and they just [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=584.8000000000001s)]
*  let him do this. Why would they do that? I mean, their own stakes in FTX minus Alameda could have [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  been worth many millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars, maybe billions of dollars. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=600.32s)]
*  I mean, the truth is in business, you can do all kinds of criminal and crazy things until you get [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=604.5600000000001s)]
*  caught. And these folks were doing insane, crazy things that the system is based on trust. And [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=609.6s)]
*  people can break that trust. We saw it remember with what was a Fulltile poker. They were also [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  taking the customer accounts and gambling those dollars. They literally mix the operations budget [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=620.72s)]
*  and the customer deposits at Fulltile poker. I think part of the rationale, if I remember right, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=626.88s)]
*  I read the Michael Lewis book on this. And part of the rationale SBF gave to Michael Lewis was that [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=634.56s)]
*  Alameda was supposed to be a market maker liquidity provider to the exchange. So they were playing an [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=641.84s)]
*  active role on the exchange of making trades available to create the market. And that was a [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=647.36s)]
*  key aspect of getting the market moving was that they had this well capitalized market maker, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=653.52s)]
*  and they knew how to actively trade on a platform and they just built their own platform. And then [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=658.3199999999999s)]
*  they were able to attract with more liquidity, more participants onto their exchange. And that [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=662.88s)]
*  was the key aspect of the business model. Yeah, but that could have kickstarted it. But like, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=667.52s)]
*  you know, five minutes into it, you could probably turn that off. I mean, you know what I'm saying? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=671.36s)]
*  Like, yeah, they didn't need to do that once you get to a certain point. Also, these people were [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=676.0799999999999s)]
*  all on speed. So there's that. They contributed to the mania. Yeah, I think like, they were they [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=680.8s)]
*  were hopped up on speed and they felt that they were gods and that, you know, stocks go up, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=688.3199999999999s)]
*  coins go up, they can do anything they want, they can hang out with celebrities. It just got [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=694.3199999999999s)]
*  diluted. And they were super entitled. I mean, this is a level of entitlement and criminal behavior [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=698.7199999999999s)]
*  that we rarely see. Doesn't matter if their tokens went up. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=704.48s)]
*  When I had my one and only interaction with SPF, which was over zoom, I asked for a model. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=710.88s)]
*  And this arrogant ding dong that worked for him sent me like a five line Excel spreadsheet. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=718.96s)]
*  And I thought, and I thought, this is the worst example of arrogance and hubris I've ever seen. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=728.8s)]
*  I had one interaction with SPF. Oh, do you want to hear it? Yeah, I got a little bit of a tiff with [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=737.28s)]
*  him. So is that a at a tech conference? This is a few years ago, this is when he was absolutely at [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=744.4799999999999s)]
*  his like peak, like, everybody wanted to talk to him. He was sort of holding court, he had a bunch [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=750.64s)]
*  of lackeys around him. And this is like a pretty exclusive tech conference. I'm not going to [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=755.36s)]
*  tar their name by mentioning them in this context. But so a friend of mine said, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=761.6s)]
*  you want to go over and meet with SPF? And so I said, Sure, whatever. So we go sit down, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=765.6s)]
*  and I started asking him about this ballot initiative that he was funding in California [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=770.48s)]
*  to raise our taxes to fund a pandemic prevention center. And as it later turned out that his [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=775.92s)]
*  brother was going to run this thing. And so I said to him, you don't even live in California, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=782.4s)]
*  what are you doing funding a ballot initiative here in my state where I live, you live in the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=789.1999999999999s)]
*  Bahamas or whatever, in order to fund this boondoggle, which by the way, is looking in [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=793.4399999999999s)]
*  the rearview mirror, we don't need it, like COVID is over. And even if we did need a pandemic [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=798.56s)]
*  prevention center, the federal government should do it, not California taxpayers. And he starts [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=803.52s)]
*  getting very animated defenses thing, we end up we sort of get into an argument. And so I kind of, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=807.28s)]
*  you know, ended it by saying, Well, listen, I'm gonna just let you know, like, I'm gonna publicly [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=813.52s)]
*  oppose this, you know, vigorously. And because I, you know, I just want to let him know, like, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=818.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna call you out for this. Standing up for the little guy, David, sex coming in, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=823.92s)]
*  standing up for his state. So when I got back from that conference, I actually talked about it on [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=828.48s)]
*  this pod. I talked about that ballot initiative in California. And that was the origin story. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=832.8s)]
*  Yeah, they capitulated. Oh, that's right. Yeah, like a month later, they dropped that thing [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=838.3199999999999s)]
*  because it was too much heat. But little did we know that they were enmeshed in all this criminality, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=842.56s)]
*  and they were absconding with all this money. What is Sam Bankman Fried's brother's name? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=847.68s)]
*  Bam Bankman Fried? Was it like Gabe or something? Gabe. Nice. I have one interaction with him at [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=853.4399999999999s)]
*  some at a annual general meeting, I got asked to interview him. And it was like a private affair [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=859.92s)]
*  a couple of months before this all blew up. And he's dressed like a slob. You know, like literally [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=867.4399999999999s)]
*  doesn't look like he showered clothes don't fit. He's wearing flip flops and shorts is kind of like [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=873.68s)]
*  the schnick. And he's a billionaire, blah, blah, blah. And I start talking to him and his leg is [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=879.4399999999999s)]
*  shaking. Like, restless leg syndrome. I mean, it but no, it's he's got his hand on it. He's trying [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=885.04s)]
*  to control it. He have restless leg syndrome. It's bouncing. I kid you not like 100 times a minute. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=891.92s)]
*  It was disturbing. And so I'm wondering if this guy's got a panic attack or what's going on. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=898.24s)]
*  And I kind of like, tone down my crypto skepticism questions, because I felt so bad for him that I [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=903.52s)]
*  was having a panic attack. And then I realized this guy's hopped up on speed. And he's got so much [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=911.0400000000001s)]
*  of Adderall, whatever these these kids were taking some patches that you wear to release this stuff. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=916.64s)]
*  I am convinced that these guys were taking a level of speed. Unbelievable. That would kill an elephant [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=922.1600000000001s)]
*  like Vietnam War level. Yeah, like these guys were out there. I mean, he would, I mean, patches, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=929.0400000000001s)]
*  these guys were wearing patches. And he was shaking. Was it like this? No. Oh, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=935.04s)]
*  did Hitler have? He was apparently also on speed. That looks like he's on amphetamines there. Yeah, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=943.1999999999999s)]
*  it did look like it was kind of almost exactly like that. Oh, my God. Where's that? For people [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=951.04s)]
*  don't know, the Third Reich was on speed. There's like many, many stories about this. Yes, X, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=959.68s)]
*  that they were hopped up on. I believe so. I'm not sure. Yeah, I believe so. I think entire books [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=967.3599999999999s)]
*  have been written about drug use by the Third Reich. But I haven't delved into it. Yeah, no, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=972.16s)]
*  no. I've listened to a couple podcasts about it, in fact. And so it must be true. I've listened [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=978.4s)]
*  to some podcasts. All right, moving on. If it was on MSNBC, it must be true. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=986.64s)]
*  Fox or Fox or if it was beep the great, your anonymous friend on Twitter must be true. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=993.1999999999999s)]
*  All right, Trump just made $5 billion on paper with his memes back. Trump social network [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1001.1999999999999s)]
*  has finally D SPAC. It's now publicly traded. You can go buy Donald Trump's back at DJT is the ticker [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1006.3199999999999s)]
*  symbol. They are on pace for a whopping $4.5 million in revenue on a $60 million lost. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1013.44s)]
*  They're growing like three X year over year. And the company is not disclosing any user metrics. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1020.6400000000001s)]
*  This quote from one of their recent filings is next. At this juncture in its development TMTG, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1028.0800000000002s)]
*  the Trump media and technology group believes that adhering to traditional KPIs, such as signups, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1035.3600000000001s)]
*  average revenue per user ad impressions and pricing or active user accounts, including monthly [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1042.32s)]
*  and daily active users could potentially divert its focus from strategic evaluation with respect [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1047.6s)]
*  to the progress and growth of its business. So they're not tracking. It's not the business. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1053.2s)]
*  It's so laughable. Like, you can barely get through it. That's crazy. They said that. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1060.8s)]
*  Literally, they said it. It's a quote from their SEC filing. According to similar web estimates, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1066.1599999999999s)]
*  Social had about five million visits last month. As of Thursday morning, it's worth about $8.5 [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1071.44s)]
*  billion. Same as Reddit or close to 2000 times top line revenue. Company had about $300 million [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1077.8400000000001s)]
*  cash after the merger. By comparison, Reddit has $800 million in revenue. Their market cap is $8.4 [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1085.04s)]
*  billion. About 10 times revenue. So it should be about five, six, seven times revenue would be [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1091.68s)]
*  more realistic according to basic media comps. Reddit had two billion visits last month with 73 [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1097.6s)]
*  million daily active users. That's pretty significant. This back took a long time to [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1104.48s)]
*  close. There was an SEC investigation into three men allegedly making 23 million buying then dumping [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1109.04s)]
*  shares of DWAC. After the merger was announced, they all face at least five fraud and conspiracy [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1116.7199999999998s)]
*  charges. Of course, this is what happened before it was DSPAC. What do you think, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1123.6s)]
*  Tramath? Thoughts on this name SPAC or SOC? I just think we should be really clear because [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1130.3999999999999s)]
*  you're just floating this insider trading thing out there as part of the introduction, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1138.1599999999999s)]
*  which is a huge allegation. We have to be really clear that is related to a few investors and not [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1142.6399999999999s)]
*  to the company itself. The company SPAC was approved by the SEC. I just think we have to [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1149.6s)]
*  be clear about that. Just to be super clear, SEC charges former DWAC board member and others for [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1154.6399999999999s)]
*  insider trading DWAC. I just don't think this is the story. This is just not the story. This is the [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1160.8799999999999s)]
*  reason it was delayed. Just to be clear, this whole thing has been delayed for a couple of years [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1167.6s)]
*  because of this. Okay, fine. It was delayed. The SEC approved it. The company is now trading. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1172.08s)]
*  What do you think of the valuation? That's the real topic, isn't it? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1178.32s)]
*  Here's what I'll say. I think that this is a really important watershed moment. It reminds me [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1181.52s)]
*  of 1997. Nick, throw this little image up. In 1997, David Bowie issued what was then famously [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1188.8s)]
*  called the Bowie Bond. It was $55 million that yielded 7.5%, which is about 80 bips [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1198.08s)]
*  above the 10-year at the time. These were 10-year bonds. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1204.0s)]
*  That's awesome. I didn't know that. The bond payments were linked to 20 albums [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1207.36s)]
*  that Bowie had released before 1990. These are 280 songs. What he basically said was, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1213.04s)]
*  listen, folks, you're essentially buying a piece of me, and in this case, my past work. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1220.64s)]
*  I'm going to take this $55 million upfront, and you're going to get paid this interest [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1227.92s)]
*  based on the royalties that I generate off that historic library for a 10-year period. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1233.04s)]
*  We think you're going to get paid the $55 million plus the 7.5% a year, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1238.1599999999999s)]
*  and then I'm going to take back the rights. If these bonds default, you will own the songs. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1242.48s)]
*  It turned out that it was an incredible bet. The people that bought it, I think it was Prudential, [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1248.56s)]
*  which I think it's an insurance company, they got paid. The bonds did not default. In 2007, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1252.3999999999999s)]
*  Bowie took back the ownership of that back catalog, but instead what he had was $55 million [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1258.8s)]
*  upfront, which allowed him to go and buy all kinds of other parts of his catalog that he didn't [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1266.08s)]
*  otherwise own. Why is this interesting? This was the first example, I think, of people monetizing [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1271.04s)]
*  themselves, their name and their likeness. In this case, it was done via debt. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1276.96s)]
*  I actually think when you look today, what's happening is a more sophisticated version of [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1282.48s)]
*  that movement, but at much larger scale. We were all joking that there was a bunch of meme coins [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1288.24s)]
*  that launched, not with any of our support, by the way, but with our names, with all these other [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1294.08s)]
*  quasi-famous people's names. Those things went up and were worth millions of dollars of value. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1300.8s)]
*  I think what this Donald J. Trump, the DJT company, what it represents, is effectively a trading coin, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1308.32s)]
*  a baseball card, if you will, a trading card via a stock on the value of Donald Trump's enterprise [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1316.72s)]
*  value, his name, his recognition, and his likeness. This, I think, is the modern [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1323.6s)]
*  instantiation of the Bowie bond. What's incredible is you can see Bowie, 30 or 40 years ago, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1328.64s)]
*  he could have generated $55 million in inflation-adjusted dollars. That's about [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1335.28s)]
*  $100 million in today's dollars. Trump, $3.5 billion, $4 billion. I think it sits on top of [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1340.0s)]
*  this idea that these very famous people, the Kim Kardashians of the world, the Donald Trumps [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1346.5600000000002s)]
*  of the world, the Mr. Beasts of the world, can eventually take companies public. When you take a [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1352.3200000000002s)]
*  company public, you have to remember, Jason, there's the revenue and the profits, right? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1358.16s)]
*  But if you look at the balance sheet of a company, there is always a line item called goodwill. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1361.8400000000001s)]
*  And goodwill is what people use to separate the assets and the liabilities and whatever's [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1367.6000000000001s)]
*  left over to generate the shareholder equity. So in this case, Donald Trump, the DJT company's [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1374.48s)]
*  balance sheet, will show a ginormous entry in goodwill. And that is the value of his name. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1379.3600000000001s)]
*  Coca-Cola has such a goodwill line item, PepsiCo does, Gatorade does, Nike does, and this company [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1385.6000000000001s)]
*  does. And I think there's going to be a lot of other companies that will go public [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1392.8s)]
*  that effectively generate a huge goodwill line item that represents the name brand value of [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1396.64s)]
*  the person associated with it. So you're a buyer? I'm not saying that. I'm just saying that there [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1402.56s)]
*  is a lot of people that will be buyers that essentially will buy this as a Donald Trump, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1407.68s)]
*  a directional bet on the value of his brand. And I'm also predicting that many other individuals [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1412.56s)]
*  will go public and have enterprise values that are levered in the same way as DJT. And that is a [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1419.52s)]
*  modern version of the boy bond from 97. Freyberg, your thoughts on the [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1427.6s)]
*  Trimont's argument that this is a proxy for the value of Donald J. Trump's brand? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1433.6799999999998s)]
*  I think that's certainly one reason why people are buying the stock and driving the price up. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1439.44s)]
*  And another one is probably a vote against traditional media, that there is a contingent [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1443.6s)]
*  of folks who are basically voting with their dollars and saying, we want an alternative [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1448.8799999999999s)]
*  to traditional media and traditional publishing platforms that have censorship that we don't [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1457.6799999999998s)]
*  agree with or have editorialization that we don't agree with. And that this investment, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1462.48s)]
*  I think, represents a way for them to vote and say, I don't want the old way. I want a new way. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1467.36s)]
*  And while this may or may not be the new way that succeeds, it may or may not be a great business, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1474.24s)]
*  and it may or may not even have much viewership or usefulness, it's a mechanism by which people [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1478.0s)]
*  can put some money down and say, I'm voting on an alternative. I want to see an alternative. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1483.76s)]
*  So I do think that there is a flashpoint indication that arises from this that's more than just the [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1488.0s)]
*  memeing aspect of it, which is certainly fun. Everyone crowds into a stock, stock price goes up, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1493.6s)]
*  it's kind of like to the moon and so on. I think there's also this element of demand for alternative [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1498.32s)]
*  media. There's demand for a different type of publishing platform. And so I think that that's [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1503.04s)]
*  what this most represents to me from what the market is telling us perspective. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1510.56s)]
*  Mad Fientist I think there's one other thing going on here, which is that this represents a [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1515.36s)]
*  populist reaction to the lawfare against Donald Trump. That I think Trump supporters want to [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1523.4399999999998s)]
*  support him against all of these lawsuits and this persecution that he's been facing. And I think one [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1531.28s)]
*  proof of this is if you turn the dial over to MSNBC, they've been losing their minds all week over [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1539.12s)]
*  this because they thought they had finally gotten the man. There was this $450 million judgment [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1544.08s)]
*  in New York that he was fined for supposedly inflating the value of assets against which he [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1549.36s)]
*  got loans, even though the bank did its own independent appraisal of the properties. And [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1556.0s)]
*  even though the banks fully got paid back and said they wanted to keep doing business with him. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1561.52s)]
*  So they thought they had finally gotten DJT and he was going to have to pay hundreds of millions [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1566.08s)]
*  dollars in fines. And then lo and behold, the spat comes along and he makes millions and millions [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1570.96s)]
*  of dollars. Now, that's not locked in yet. We're still in this lockup period where for six months, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1575.3600000000001s)]
*  there's a very small float. And it's probably the case that once there's more shares on a liquid [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1581.44s)]
*  market, we'll find out what the real valuation is. So let's call the valuation we're seeing today [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1588.0s)]
*  based on a very small float, let's call this more of a preliminary number. And Trump can't sell yet, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1592.72s)]
*  but presumably after six months when the lockup comes off, he'll be able to sell. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1598.8s)]
*  So look, I think fundamentally what's going on here is this is political. Trump's enemies are angry [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1602.8s)]
*  about this SPAC because they see that it gives them a lifeline. And I think Trump supporters are [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1607.9199999999998s)]
*  deliberately buying the stock to support their guy. And to say that this lawfare against Trump [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1612.72s)]
*  that basically seeks to imprison the man or bankrupt the man, this has simply run against him, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1618.8s)]
*  is a new low in American political discourse. And I think there's millions of people who [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1624.56s)]
*  agree with that. And some of them are willing to buy this stock as a protest vote. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1628.56s)]
*  Aaron Norris I agree 100% with the protest vote. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1633.6s)]
*  He had what, 60, 70 million people vote for him. He got 74%? 74 million rather, 46.8% to Biden's [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1637.52s)]
*  81 million. But 2% of those people want to buy the stock. It's a million and a half people. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1646.3999999999999s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happening here. They don't care if they lose the money. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1651.76s)]
*  Actual value of this company with 5 million in revenue, 4 million in yearly revenue. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1655.36s)]
*  I mean, if you really want it to be absolutely insane and give it 100x valuation, it's worth [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1660.6399999999999s)]
*  400 million. And so then if whatever goodwill Donald Trump's likeness is, maybe that's another [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1666.32s)]
*  500 million, but you'll lose a large amount of money, I predict, if you buy this. And if you're [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1674.1599999999999s)]
*  buying it as a protest vote, sure, go for it. Pete O'Reilly Why don't you, J. Cal, why don't you [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1679.2s)]
*  short it as a J trade? Like Gabe Plotkin? J. Cal I never shorted a stock. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1683.68s)]
*  And I think- Pete O'Reilly Remember Gabe Plotkin? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1686.24s)]
*  J. Cal No. Who's this? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1688.8s)]
*  Pete O'Reilly Oh, remember from Melvin Capital? He thought he could- [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1690.88s)]
*  J. Cal He blew up his funds shorting game stocks. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1694.72s)]
*  Pete O'Reilly He thought he could outsmart all the apes. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1696.3200000000002s)]
*  J. Cal Yeah, that's exactly why I wouldn't do it. I've never shorted. I think that, you know, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1698.0800000000002s)]
*  you get these Trump voters and it starts going up because of the small float, which is what's [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1702.64s)]
*  happening now. They might send this thing to $80 billion, you know? Who knows what is possible with [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1706.8s)]
*  the short float and a motivated, you know, million, two million people. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1712.88s)]
*  J. Cal You guys are bringing up something else as well, which is we've shifted from [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1717.2800000000002s)]
*  fundamental-based stock trading being the overwhelming driver to there's a lot of like [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1722.64s)]
*  very speculative day-over-day activity that you can't control anymore. And I think it's part and [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1728.48s)]
*  parcel of what's happening in other markets in America as well. So, when you look at sort of like [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1732.88s)]
*  what happened in 2016 when the Supreme Court said each state can regulate sports gambling, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1738.08s)]
*  all forms of like online gamesmanship and betting just started to skyrocket. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1746.08s)]
*  It could be casinos, lotteries, sports betting. It didn't matter, but everything just caught a [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1750.8s)]
*  massive ginormous bid. And when you look at the products that service the retail market, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1754.8799999999999s)]
*  they've also become increasingly gamified. Robinhood is probably the best example of [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1760.96s)]
*  having built an incredibly good business by making things more like a game. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1766.56s)]
*  And then recently adding fuel to the fire are things like zero-day options, which are just like, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1771.76s)]
*  and there was a big article in the Wall Street Journal where like one of the reporters, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1776.8s)]
*  she became addicted to it. And like the Wall Street Journal gave her, I want to say like [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1780.48s)]
*  a few thousand bucks, but she had to disgorge the profits. And she got like a 2000% return or [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1786.08s)]
*  something, specking zero-day options via Robinhood. So, the point is that on top of the whole [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1793.84s)]
*  movement to sort of allow individuals to monetize their own name and likeness via the stock market, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1804.08s)]
*  which we just talked about, the second movement is that a lot of these things are becoming less [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1808.8799999999999s)]
*  financialized and more gamified. And so you just have many more participants. And so to your point, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1814.0s)]
*  you can have a GameStop moment in any of these things. You can have these zero-day options run [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1818.72s)]
*  the stock to the moon. I would tread very lightly. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1823.28s)]
*  Yeah. And just another warning, the stock market bases things ultimately on like earnings [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1829.92s)]
*  and profits. And so when we look at this as a proxy and Mr. Beast would have the same issue [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1838.08s)]
*  or Martha Stewart, you have a key man, key individual risk here, i.e. this person goes [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1843.68s)]
*  to jail, they die, whatever, which Martha Stewart always had in her businesses. And then what [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1849.92s)]
*  is included in this is key. So if he does another TV show and it becomes a hit again, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1856.3200000000002s)]
*  is that included in this? No. If he has another building or his building's included in this? No. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1862.3200000000002s)]
*  The golf course is included in this? No. What's included in this, included in this deal when you [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1866.88s)]
*  buy DJT is apparently just a really crazy social network that nobody uses. So just be clear what [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1871.2s)]
*  you're buying. No, you're right. The more sophisticated version of this trading card [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1881.28s)]
*  analogy would be if Donald Trump contributed his brand licensing revenue in perpetuity to the asset. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1887.6000000000001s)]
*  And then it really is a longitudinal forward bet on the Trump name. And that's sort of more like [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1896.0s)]
*  if Virgin, like if Richard Branson took the Virgin Holdco public, that's effectively what that is as [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1903.6s)]
*  well. Like, you know, Branson over 40 or 50 years has built an incredible business. I think the [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1910.24s)]
*  stat that I heard when I got to know him was he's created 20 businesses worth at least a billion [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1915.2s)]
*  dollars or more over his lifetime. With the Virgin brand. With the Virgin brand. And the Virgin brand [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1923.04s)]
*  is a licensing model where he holds that right and he will license it to you for a share of the [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1929.04s)]
*  revenue. That's independent of anything else that he may do with these businesses. And so if he took [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1934.1599999999999s)]
*  that Virgin Holdco public, then what you're buying is a longitudinal discount of cash flow on the [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1939.04s)]
*  value of Virgin. And to your point, if Trump contributed that name and likeness licensing [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1943.92s)]
*  capability into this, by the way, he could also still do that. So to the extent that this business [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1951.12s)]
*  saw a contraction, and maybe the truth social thing didn't end up being that valuable. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1957.28s)]
*  But the other aspects of the media business he could create by basically saying, Okay, look, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1961.84s)]
*  this will get a share of my licensing revenue for my name would effectively be a proxy to do that. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1965.28s)]
*  So he's got a lot of outs here to maintain this market value. And then on top of that, to your [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1969.76s)]
*  point, there's 70 million odd people who would want to support him in one way, shape or form. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1975.04s)]
*  I would not go anywhere in your shorting it given his, his fan base is incredibly likely to keep [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1980.4s)]
*  buying these shares. And if you want to know the actual value of this business today, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1987.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm an expert at this. It's $100 million. It's $200 million. It's not anywhere close to this. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1992.4s)]
*  Put your money where your mouth is. We just no, no, we just explained when you have a small [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=1998.16s)]
*  float like this and a rabid group of people who are gambling, you will get your face ripped off. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2002.3200000000002s)]
*  Absolutely stupid. What's that? You'll get flunked. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2007.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's, it's disastrous. I mean, they, what did they say? We can be stupid longer. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2012.32s)]
*  We can be retarded longer than you can be solvent. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2017.28s)]
*  The red is such a great line. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2021.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, but you can gamble like this on stocks, yet you cannot invest in private companies. I [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2025.44s)]
*  don't get the legal system in America. Be careful out there, folks. You will lose a large portion of [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2031.2s)]
*  money is my prediction if you buy this stock, but feel free if you want to gamble. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2036.0s)]
*  Look, I think, I think this is all part of the ongoing backlash to lawfare. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2041.36s)]
*  Yeah. Joe Biden instructed his justice department to prosecute Trump. It's, in my view, it's utterly [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2045.04s)]
*  impressive in American history for one president to try and prosecute, imprison and bankrupt his [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2052.64s)]
*  main opponent in the political election. And there are millions of Americans who are absolutely [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2057.52s)]
*  disgusted by this. I think it's a new low in American politics and God bless all the people [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2060.96s)]
*  buying these shares to support Trump. This is a protest vote. I don't know whether they're going [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2066.4s)]
*  to make money or lose money. Like I said, I don't think you can justify the valuation based on [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2071.12s)]
*  fundamentals, but you can sure as hell justify it based on payback. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2075.52s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, if you want to give your money to a billionaire, buy the stock. Absolutely. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2080.0s)]
*  Feel free. I think probably, I agree with you, like maybe two of the six lawsuits are a bit [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2084.88s)]
*  weak. I think the three or four other ones, you know, he committed the crimes and he's just paying [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2090.96s)]
*  the price, but you know, we can agree to disagree on this part. Tell us what people do. Speaking of [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2095.36s)]
*  intelligent people, R.F.K. June, you just picked up his running mate. This is a little bit crazy, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2099.76s)]
*  and I'm really interested in hearing your thoughts on it. He chose a 38 year old Bay Area lawyer, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2106.4s)]
*  Nicole Shanahan as his VP. R.F.K. explained why he chose her. She knows big tech very well, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2111.6s)]
*  how they use AI to exploit the public, how they censor and surveil Americans, push certain agendas. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2117.84s)]
*  She understands the health consequences of toxins in our air, soil and food. And he wanted a younger [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2123.84s)]
*  person to represent millennials and Gen Z. He says younger generations feel like nobody represents [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2129.7599999999998s)]
*  them in Washington. He also wanted an athlete in good shape to inspire Americans to live [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2135.68s)]
*  healthier lives. And Shanahan donated four million in support of R.F.K. Junior's Super Bowl ad [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2140.72s)]
*  that ran earlier this year. Sax, what do you think of this pick? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2148.72s)]
*  Well, this pick does not excite me. I'll be frank. Since I'm going to say something critical, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2155.8399999999997s)]
*  I want to start by saying something positive because I really, you know, I love Bobby Kennedy. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2163.12s)]
*  I mean, I think that he represents a number of really great issues that I agree with. I mean, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2168.4s)]
*  first of all, he's been the most articulate critic of the Ukraine War, understands it deeply, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2174.88s)]
*  and has explained it extremely well. He stood up for sealing the border. He went down there, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2178.88s)]
*  showed that it's out of control, completely agree. He was a vocal critic of Fauci and lockdowns, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2184.1600000000003s)]
*  was completely right about COVID. He supports civil liberties and free speech. So, you know, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2189.76s)]
*  I want to say like Bobby Kennedy is great. The issue I have with this pick is that she doesn't [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2197.52s)]
*  represent any of those issues. She has a completely different issue matrix. And I watched her speech. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2202.32s)]
*  And just to say something positive about her, I mean, I like her enthusiasm. I think she's 38, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2208.48s)]
*  and it's nice to have someone running for political office who's not in their 70s or 80s. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2214.64s)]
*  And I think she's genuine. I actually think she's saying what she really believes, and that's really [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2220.24s)]
*  nice and refreshing. But again, if you go back to the issues themselves, she brought up three [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2224.8s)]
*  issues. Number one is she says she wants to make Americans healthy again. It's the focus on chronic [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2229.52s)]
*  disease. I'm not saying she's wrong about that. That's not my issue. Number two, she brought up [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2234.48s)]
*  criminal justice reform. This one concerns me. Apparently, she donated to Gascon, who's a Soros [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2239.2000000000003s)]
*  DA who helped destroy San Francisco and then failed upward to LA. So apparently, she's a Gascon [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2245.6800000000003s)]
*  supporter that does not fill me with confidence. That is a, quite frankly, luxury liberal belief [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2251.44s)]
*  in this decarceration idea. So I'm not excited about that. Her third issue was climate and [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2260.0s)]
*  environment related, but in a very specific way, she went after big agriculture. She said, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2266.4s)]
*  we can no longer support extractive corporate agriculture. I'm going to let Freberg speak to [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2272.08s)]
*  that one. I can't really say whether she's right or wrong, but that's not one of my issues. So [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2277.12s)]
*  listen, at the end of the day, I feel like this pick accentuates and underlines the issues in [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2282.64s)]
*  Bobby's platform that appeal to the left, frankly, to liberals. And look, I think Bobby's candidacy [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2291.12s)]
*  is a complex candidacy that brings together people from both left and right. But again, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2298.4s)]
*  this pick does not speak to me. It speaks to the more liberal parts of his coalition. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2304.32s)]
*  Does it increase his chances? And who would have been the person who would have increased [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2310.48s)]
*  his chances most? Tulsi? Well, the person who would have been amazing would have been Tulsi [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2314.8s)]
*  Gabbard. Okay, if he had chosen Tulsi, he would have blown the doors off. Slam dunk. Yeah. I mean, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2321.36s)]
*  and Tulsi has been saying Chamath publicly that she would be proud to serve with Trump and [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2327.2000000000003s)]
*  seeming likely that she's got a shot at that. Yeah. Being the VP for Trump. I'm not going to [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2333.84s)]
*  comment on that. Okay. Let me just say something else. I think Tulsi Gabbard is really impressive. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2340.48s)]
*  I think she's independent. And I think she really stands firmly on her own two feet in a way that I [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2348.08s)]
*  find inspiring. I, like Sax, have many, many positive thoughts about Bobby Kennedy. I think [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2354.64s)]
*  he was really a breath of fresh air, Jason, in this election cycle, because he was able to say [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2365.68s)]
*  the unsayable things and made those things more easy to be said by others. And I think that there's [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2372.4s)]
*  a really important role in that. And I think he deserves a lot of credit for that. And then [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2377.52s)]
*  the fact that he said things that were so unconventional and not mainstream that are now [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2382.08s)]
*  mainstream views, I think says a lot to the fact that he was pretty grounded in first principles [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2388.64s)]
*  thinking on those topics. And I think that having those kinds of people in office [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2394.96s)]
*  are really good for America. All of that said, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2401.6s)]
*  I do agree with David that I think the pick was meant to be more about covering his left flank. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2404.2400000000002s)]
*  And I found that an odd calculation. And I wonder whether it wouldn't have been easier to cover the [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2413.0400000000004s)]
*  right flank. And there are different folks that could have been in the mix to do that. And so I [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2422.2400000000002s)]
*  think that it was a calculation, though. And I think it's about he has a core set of issues. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2428.72s)]
*  It's about whether he appeals more to this side or to this side in order to get the totality of [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2434.7999999999997s)]
*  the votes that he think is possible. Second, he was under a little bit of a time constraint because [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2438.64s)]
*  some of these states need the VP candidate named. And he's under a shot clock that the other two are [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2444.08s)]
*  not. So I mean, I wish Bobby the best because I think some combination of Bobby doing well [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2450.16s)]
*  and some upheaval between the Democrats and the Republicans is really the only chance we have of [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2462.72s)]
*  having a credible third party. Well, let's see now what happens. By the way, we should just say like, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2466.96s)]
*  you know, Joe Lieberman passed away, which is really unfortunate. You know, he was a really [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2472.8799999999997s)]
*  independent thinker as well. Let's see what no labels really does here. There's a little [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2479.6s)]
*  bit of chaos over at no labels, I think. But so there's a lot of moving parts. So [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2484.7999999999997s)]
*  it was clearly calculus. I don't totally understand what that formula was, though. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2489.52s)]
*  Just to build on something Jamass said, there's a report by Colin rug that the DNC realizes what [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2494.8799999999997s)]
*  Jamass said about this covering Bobby's left flank rather than his right flank. And apparently they're [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2501.04s)]
*  in somewhat of a panic about this. And I think what you're going to see is that lawyers from the [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2506.8s)]
*  DNC and the Biden campaign are going to fight tooth and nail to keep this ticket off the ballot, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2513.1200000000003s)]
*  at least in the major contested states like the five or six states where the presidency will be [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2519.76s)]
*  decided in 2024. And of course, they'll be saying they're doing this to save democracy, but you're [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2524.32s)]
*  going to see I think a full court press by DNC lawyers to keep the Kennedy Shanahan ticket off [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2529.76s)]
*  the ballot. Yeah, this seems really like it's going to damage Biden, which was my original [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2536.56s)]
*  prediction. And that a lot of reason why a lot of the right wing were supporting RFK was because [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2542.0s)]
*  they wanted they saw this as a clear path to take away a couple of points from Biden. And I think [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2547.12s)]
*  the first part is happening. Yeah, first part of what you said is 100%. Right? I'm not sure that [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2551.44s)]
*  a bunch of Republicans are going to get organized J Cal to vote for RFK in that way. Oh, no, I don't [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2557.2799999999997s)]
*  think they're going to do that. I think they supported him publicly in order to build him up [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2565.04s)]
*  as a centrist candidate, knowing that it would take away from Biden. So I just think on a strategic [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2569.2799999999997s)]
*  political basis, all these Republicans do that for for Marianne Williamson. Why not? Yeah, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2574.32s)]
*  she's not electable. Yeah, no, no, it's because she's not electable. I mean, she's like, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2579.44s)]
*  not like a viable candidate. It's pretty clear she's not. Why can't you just accept that people [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2584.96s)]
*  on the right like the issues that Bobby spoke to? Isn't that the simple explanation? I think that [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2590.08s)]
*  they're partisans and they just want to win. So I don't think it has anything to do with what [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2594.64s)]
*  you're saying, which would be like authentically liking and connecting with what he's saying. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2597.92s)]
*  I don't think it was that I think it's a strategic plan to try to pull Biden votes. And I think [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2601.3599999999997s)]
*  Republicans are smart. You think he's a plant? You think he's a plant? I think their support for him [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2606.4s)]
*  is for nefarious reasons. They're supporting him to take votes away from Biden. And here it is, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2610.7999999999997s)]
*  we're all agreeing that this is going to take votes away from Biden. So I think it's a very [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2616.08s)]
*  clever strategy in the GOP. Hold on, just to add one point to that. Remember, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2619.8399999999997s)]
*  that when Bobby entered the race, he did so as a Democrat. He did so challenging Joe Biden for [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2624.48s)]
*  the nomination of the Democratic Party. How did the Democratic Party react? They kept him off the [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2629.52s)]
*  ballot. They wouldn't give him a fair shot. That's why he went independent. So he did not have to be [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2633.36s)]
*  this, you know, sort of like what you're kind of implying, like a flying the ointment type [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2638.48s)]
*  third party candidate. He tried to be the Democratic candidate. They wouldn't let him compete. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2643.04s)]
*  If they let him compete in a fair way, maybe he would have stayed a Democrat. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2647.36s)]
*  I would have loved to have a massive competitive field of Democrats. I think the Democrats are [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2650.8s)]
*  screwing this up big time. I think this could be the most this could I think they could peel [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2656.48s)]
*  off a couple of percentage points. Yeah. In those more I think you're right. I think it's more than [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2661.52s)]
*  that. So I mean, I think it's more than so we all agree. That's what's happening here. Then we're [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2666.1600000000003s)]
*  just disagreeing. No, I think this is I think we agree it's taking points away. Yeah, I think we [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2669.92s)]
*  agree about that. But what I'm saying is that this is where we've ended up. I don't think it [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2675.52s)]
*  was constructed to be this way. Ah, interesting. Freeburg your thoughts on this candidate [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2679.92s)]
*  specifically around her love of organic food and wanting to take on the pesticides, toxic food, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2686.48s)]
*  you know, and the industrial food complex steadfast in my commitment to there being only one major [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2695.84s)]
*  issue facing this country. And that is the federal debt and the deficit. We are increasing the [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2702.32s)]
*  federal debt by a trillion dollars every hundred days. That number is not slowing down. The current [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2707.68s)]
*  budget proposal from the Biden administration calls for over $7.2 trillion to be spent next year. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2713.9199999999996s)]
*  That makes the US federal government roughly one third of our country's GDP. The outrageousness [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2720.24s)]
*  of the condition that the US is in right now makes it so insane to me that we are talking about any [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2727.2799999999997s)]
*  other topic like big agriculture or whatever other nonsense was being spattered about as important [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2735.52s)]
*  topics to this particular person. If every voting citizen of the United States does not recognize [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2743.36s)]
*  the severity of the deficit and debt problem that the federal government faces, you are wasting your [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2748.0s)]
*  vote. And no candidate is speaking to what is clearly the biggest issue of our time. And we need [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2753.6s)]
*  to address this issue headlong. So I don't care about this person or anyone else who's running for [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2759.04s)]
*  office that is talking about stuff that we cannot actually address and problems we cannot actually [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2764.0s)]
*  solve if we don't get our fiscal affairs in order. That's my point of view. Got it. And [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2769.04s)]
*  respect for that. Can anybody win the presidency on a, hey, we're going to balance the budget, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2774.8s)]
*  we're going to cut spending platform? Nope. So they can't win. And it's an existential issue. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2781.04s)]
*  That's why I look, I mean, I'll keep shouting into the abyss. Nope. Yeah, a few people hear it. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2787.44s)]
*  And that at some point, it becomes a topic that folks do begin to focus on. I think that [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2793.68s)]
*  the necessity of raising tax rates, the necessity ultimately of cutting entitlement programs, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2800.96s)]
*  the necessary inflation that will arise because of the condition of the federal government's [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2808.3999999999996s)]
*  debt level, because we're going to have to keep printing money. These are the sorts of things that [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2814.64s)]
*  are like a boiling pot that one day folks will wake up and say, well, what the heck happened? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2819.44s)]
*  Everything got mismanaged. And it's not a Democrat problem. It's not a Republican problem. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2824.2400000000002s)]
*  It's a fundamental problem of people voting themselves all the money and people getting [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2829.36s)]
*  voted into office by saying, I'm going to do more than is being done today. And that costs money. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2834.08s)]
*  And no one actually addresses the rampant misuse of funds, the lack of accountability in spending, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2838.7200000000003s)]
*  and the fact that we have an incredible amount of negative ROI spending and the fact that we've [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2845.92s)]
*  effectively created an economy that's fundamentally dependent on federal spending. And I'll go through [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2850.0s)]
*  some statistics when we talk about Biden's budget later in the show, but I think that the significance [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2854.48s)]
*  is just overlooked by all of these candidates. And we're not really talking about the thing [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2860.32s)]
*  that matters. So, all right, so let's break down Biden's proposed budget of 2025. Post budget was [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2865.2000000000003s)]
*  7.3 trillion for fiscal 2025. That starts in October of 2024. It's up 18% from 2023. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2872.08s)]
*  Projected deficit, 1.78 trillion, which is similar to the deficits we ran in 23 and 24. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2880.08s)]
*  The budget projects an average deficit of 1.6 trillion per year over the next decade. National [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2886.96s)]
*  debt, as Freberg was alluding to, is insane. It's at 34.5 trillion. But we made some charts here to [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2892.4s)]
*  go through all of this. Let's pull up the first chart. And this is comparing Biden's proposed [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2899.76s)]
*  budget in 2025 with budgets from 2005 and 2015. Defense spending has actually grown pretty modestly [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2905.28s)]
*  during that time, but entitlements, interest payments, and non-defense spending have jumped [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2913.5200000000004s)]
*  significantly. The US will owe 965 billion in interest on its debt next year. That's 65 billion [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2917.76s)]
*  more than the proposed defense budget. And in 2026, the US will surpass one trillion on interest [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2924.32s)]
*  owed on its debt. And we'll talk about that more in a minute. But let's start here with [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2931.36s)]
*  this first chart. And then jump out to you, Chamath, here. That's notable and worth discussing. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2935.76s)]
*  All the areas that we need to cut, we can't even have a conversation about. So they'll never get [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2942.2400000000002s)]
*  cut and they'll keep growing. So I think that we probably need to figure out what the alternatives [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2947.36s)]
*  are. So if you can't have a conversation about expenses, the only logical place is to have a [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2957.1200000000003s)]
*  conversation about revenues. And what that means for the government is in taxation. And so I don't [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2963.44s)]
*  know, Jason, what we do here. There could be a couple of saving graces. So there are some things [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2973.12s)]
*  happening, for example, on the Medicare side that could be profoundly disruptive. They are, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2981.52s)]
*  now, again, I'm just going to put this out there as it's happening. I don't know if it's good or [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2987.2799999999997s)]
*  bad, but they are looking at reimbursing things like Wigovia and Ozempic and whatnot. If you look [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2990.72s)]
*  at the underlying costs of those kinds of chronic diseases, diabetes, heart disease, etc., [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=2998.0s)]
*  and you put a large swath of the American population on those drugs, the reimbursement [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3005.12s)]
*  value of those drugs versus the cost of actually the chronic care management would save you [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3009.12s)]
*  many hundreds of billions of dollars a year. So that's something. Second is on the defense side, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3014.08s)]
*  there's a large portion of that budget that's migrating away from traditional tactical warfare [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3020.0s)]
*  to things that are unmanned vehicles and cyber and whatnot that could save two or $300 billion [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3025.6s)]
*  there. So there are places where you could save $500 billion to a trillion dollars. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3030.56s)]
*  But I think it's going to be a almost impossible conversation and it'll happen by accident. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3037.92s)]
*  So then the only forced conversation that I think we are going to have as a society is around [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3043.36s)]
*  taxation. And that's really bad for, you know, a lot of people that don't believe that's the path to [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3047.84s)]
*  generating growth. One of the challenges is that there are, and we should reference these in the [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3055.28s)]
*  show notes, Nick, but there are well-researched economic studies that show that when a government [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3059.84s)]
*  tries to increase the taxation level north of 20% of GDP of that economy, that you actually see GDP [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3066.48s)]
*  growth go negative. That there's a certain natural equilibrium on which you can tax the system. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3075.2s)]
*  Beyond that level, investment dollars go down and growth begins to shrink. And that's what triggers [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3081.52s)]
*  the spiraling problem. Because then the government spending needs to go up to continue to grow and [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3087.04s)]
*  support growth in the economy. And it creates this inevitable spiraling. Would you call this the [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3091.12s)]
*  Atlas Shrug? The Atlas Shrug effect is investment goes down. There's a Fred chart showing percent of [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3096.48s)]
*  GDP that's federal tax receipts and then percent of GDP that's spending. And then the gap is your [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3102.96s)]
*  deficit. And Freiburg's right that I think in the absolute best economy, or best years of the best [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3110.96s)]
*  economy, so it's like, you know, the best year of the Reagan boom and the best year of the Clinton [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3118.08s)]
*  boom when we had the government surplus, I think the government was extracting just shy of 20% [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3122.48s)]
*  of GDP. And in the 70s, when marginal tax rates were at 70%, so before the Reagan tax cuts, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3128.48s)]
*  we were actually extract extracting a lower percentage of GDP. So there's only so much blood [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3136.24s)]
*  you can get from a stone. If you raise tax rates on a marginal basis high enough, the economy performs [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3141.12s)]
*  worse, and you actually end up collecting less, or people spend a lot more money on lawyers and [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3147.7599999999998s)]
*  accountants to basically figure out more structuring schemes to avoid paying taxes. So the years in [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3153.9199999999996s)]
*  which we've got the highest percentage of revenue out of the economy are in good economic years, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3159.6s)]
*  where we've had reasonable levels of taxation, as opposed to the highest levels of taxation. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3167.44s)]
*  And so the problem is with the spending, I mean, we used to be able to keep spending to [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3173.04s)]
*  somewhere between, I'd say in the best years of the years the Clinton surplus, I think, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3179.6s)]
*  spending as a percentage of GDP was like 18.8%. It's around 20% of GDP goes to federal spending. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3185.52s)]
*  That was normal. But then the spending got out of control during COVID, and it went up to like 25, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3193.52s)]
*  30% of GDP went to federal spending. It's starting to come down, but it's still way too big a number. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3199.36s)]
*  Anyway, my point is that a starting point for dealing with next year's budget is free spending, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3204.8s)]
*  just free spending. The 18% increase is not a good idea. If we want to get this problem under [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3211.92s)]
*  control, freeze the spending, we can talk about taxation, but you're only going to get so much [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3217.6s)]
*  blood from the stone. An increased spending is stimulatory, and so it works well in an election [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3222.0s)]
*  year. I would say we took two major crises, and we had crisis level spending, and then we normalized [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3226.96s)]
*  that spending and allowed it to carry forward, starting with the 08 financial crisis with our [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3234.2400000000002s)]
*  monetary policy, and then being accelerated with COVID and our fiscal policy. I did some [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3238.56s)]
*  back of the envelope map. I'm sure there are economists who have done a better job of this [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3247.36s)]
*  than I. There are directly 3 million Americans that are directly employed by the federal government. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3250.64s)]
*  There's 167 million workers in the US, so 3 million are directly employed by the federal government. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3255.68s)]
*  If you take the rest of the federal spending that flows into the economy, it's about 3.5 trillion a [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3261.12s)]
*  year. Assume 30% of that capital goes to equity holders and businesses that own businesses that [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3265.44s)]
*  benefit from that spending, and the rest flows through to labor. That's about 13% of GDP flowing [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3271.12s)]
*  through to labor. Assuming average annual income, that's another roughly 45, 50 million people that [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3276.0s)]
*  are directly benefiting, that are directly earning income because of federal spending. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3282.56s)]
*  There's another 50 million people in the US that rely on social security. Here's another important [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3286.7200000000003s)]
*  statistic. There's somewhere between 12 and 20 million people in the US that pay more than 50% [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3291.68s)]
*  tax rate today. Those people are effectively working for the federal government because [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3298.24s)]
*  half of their income goes back to the government. When you add this all up, there's over 100, [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3304.08s)]
*  120 million people in the US that are directly working for or getting paid by the federal [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3308.7999999999997s)]
*  government in the US. That is such a significant percentage of our economy. That is such a [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3315.2799999999997s)]
*  significant dependency on individual income on a federal government. I don't want to use the term [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3320.88s)]
*  socialism, but the ability for US labor to earn is so largely dependent and largely driven by [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3327.36s)]
*  federal spending at this point. It becomes this critical linchpin to enabling progression [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3335.28s)]
*  economically, to enabling the labor force to continue to participate, that the federal [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3342.4s)]
*  government is now the primary customer or employer of most of the labor force in the United States [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3348.24s)]
*  today. That is a deeply and profoundly different circumstance than what I think the founding [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3354.7999999999997s)]
*  fathers envisioned when the federal government was supposed to be this lightweight, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3360.56s)]
*  overseeing organization of a federated republic of states. Unfortunately, I think we find ourselves [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3365.68s)]
*  in a condition, as Jamal points out, that's very hard to get out of. This is going to require [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3370.9599999999996s)]
*  a dedicated multi-decade effort to create a slow unwinding from this deep dependency that our labor [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3375.84s)]
*  force has on federal spending. I'm just so shocked that this isn't the critical problem of our day [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3381.04s)]
*  that we're not all spending time on. Folks have pointed out that this only goes one way at this [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3386.88s)]
*  point. Hey, Nick, can you bring up that first thread chart? This is federal receipts as percent [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3391.1200000000003s)]
*  of GDP, and it goes all the way back to World War II. To Freeberg's point, we've never gone above 20%. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3397.44s)]
*  Look at that. We've had tax rates as high as 90%. I'm saying top marginal tax rates as high as 90%, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3405.84s)]
*  I think after World War II, because we're trying to get out of the deficit that was created by the [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3412.0s)]
*  war spending. You can't get above 20%. Yeah, exactly. The economy shrinks. No, but hold on. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3415.92s)]
*  I gave you this OECD report. It says that since 2000, we've been [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3422.4s)]
*  in the mid-20s, and the OECD average is 34 in terms of tax to GDP. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3428.48s)]
*  Tax to GDP. This includes state and local then, right? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3434.4s)]
*  Probably, yeah. Yeah, I just showed federal. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3440.56s)]
*  I think this probably includes state and local. Which, by the way, is a whole other [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3443.6s)]
*  Bollywood, because I didn't include those numbers in my employment statistics. The US Bureau of Labor [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3447.2799999999997s)]
*  Statistics estimates that about 20.2 million Americans are employed by local and state [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3451.68s)]
*  governments, directly employed by local and state governments. Again, when you add this all up, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3457.52s)]
*  the majority of the US labor force is employed by the government, or is a beneficiary of the [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3461.84s)]
*  government as the primary customer, or is supported by government entitlement programs. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3468.2400000000002s)]
*  If you go back to that Fred chart for a second, if you basically acknowledge the point that 20% is [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3472.88s)]
*  the ceiling on how much we can extract from an economy based on 80 years of data, with all sorts [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3478.2400000000002s)]
*  of different tax schemes, then I think what we should say is that federal spending will be capped [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3487.28s)]
*  at 20% of GDP. You see what I'm saying? If we can't go above 20% on receipts, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3493.2000000000003s)]
*  cap federal spending at 20%. That should be a constitutional amendment. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3499.36s)]
*  Right. Then on the revenue side, we should say, what is the best tax code to achieve that 18%, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3502.6400000000003s)]
*  19%, 20%? Because what we do right now is we just say, well, just tax the rich. But what we've seen [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3511.92s)]
*  is we've been taxing the rich as high as 90% in the past, and you didn't get more revenue. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3516.96s)]
*  We should be much more scientific about saying, well, given that our target is, let's say 20%, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3523.12s)]
*  what's the best way to do that? No one really has that conversation. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3528.7200000000003s)]
*  No, none of the conversations have to do with data or building a bulletproof system. The same [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3532.2400000000002s)]
*  thing we could say about immigration, where we try to talk about the numbers here of what's a [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3537.92s)]
*  reasonable number of people and tying that to an actual number. And it's pretty obvious we should [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3542.96s)]
*  have one immigration policy when we have 5% unemployment and a different one if we had, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3550.2400000000002s)]
*  God forbid, 15 or 20% unemployment. It could be tied to the unemployment rate. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3555.68s)]
*  Right. Can we just stay on budget for a second? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3560.96s)]
*  The fundamental structural problem I'm highlighting is that we've created an economy [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3562.0s)]
*  that is so deeply dependent on federal spending, that the federal spending levels are what's [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3566.88s)]
*  support so many employed and so many companies in the US. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3572.72s)]
*  You're answering your own question. That's why it can't stop. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3576.64s)]
*  Right. I don't think the real economy that creates all the innovation and all the value and all the [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3579.52s)]
*  good paying jobs, I think that is separate from what the government does. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3585.04s)]
*  That's the deflationary economy. That's the true market-based deflationary economy. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3588.3199999999997s)]
*  The problem is once we've layered in all of these layers of dependency from federal dollars flowing [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3592.48s)]
*  into businesses or into people's pockets, it's very difficult to back out of that. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3597.92s)]
*  I don't call that dependency. I call that special interests. I think there's a lot of special [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3602.32s)]
*  interests who are basically looting the federal government and taking all this money and then they [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3606.8s)]
*  turn around and use some of it to donate back to the politicians and lobby for more spending. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3611.2000000000003s)]
*  What you're calling dependency is really more special interests, meaning that I don't think [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3616.88s)]
*  we need to have this level of spending in order to have a successful economy. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3621.28s)]
*  I think it makes our economy less successful. Yep. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3625.28s)]
*  It's still stimulatory because, Sachs, remember Mitch McConnell, when they were talking about [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3628.24s)]
*  supporting Ukraine, his primary argument, as you remember, was that all of these dollars are going [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3632.24s)]
*  to go into defense contractors' pockets, which is going to go to employees' pockets, which is going [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3637.68s)]
*  to stimulate our economy. That's the fundamental thinking behind it. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3641.68s)]
*  But that doesn't create value. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3644.24s)]
*  I know, but that's the thinking behind it. That's the political system. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3645.68s)]
*  Okay. Let me just walk through this real quick. If the government prints a bunch of money and hands [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3649.4399999999996s)]
*  it to people with STEMI checks, we all understand that creates no economic value. It just creates [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3654.32s)]
*  inflation. Okay. Now, if the government does the same thing, but instead of a STEMI check, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3658.48s)]
*  pays people to dig holes and fill them back up, that's the exact same thing. No economic value, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3663.76s)]
*  just inflation. Now, let's say the government pays people to create bombs that create holes [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3668.0800000000004s)]
*  in other countries. Exact same thing. No economic value for the country. It just creates inflation [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3675.2000000000003s)]
*  here. Why is that? Because the only thing that creates economic value in the United States is [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3680.32s)]
*  the production of goods and services that people can actually consume and use and that they want. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3685.44s)]
*  Federal spending on basically make work projects or things that people don't really want, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3692.48s)]
*  or they don't use, or even worse, bombs that get dropped on poor people in other countries, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3697.92s)]
*  none of that creates any value. But I don't think it's a real economic dependency. I think it is [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3703.84s)]
*  just a special interest that keeps lobbying for all this stuff. But besides, what about housing [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3708.64s)]
*  and healthcare and education? Because those are the three biggest line items and it's been [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3712.3199999999997s)]
*  inflationary across all three of those line items in the US economy. The federal government has [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3716.24s)]
*  stepped in to provide broader access to housing, broader access to healthcare, and broader access [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3720.72s)]
*  to education. And in the process- That's why the price goes up. There's that famous chart showing [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3725.3599999999997s)]
*  inflation by category and all the categories where the federal government provides subsidies, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3730.8799999999997s)]
*  the prices have gone up, and all the categories- Education, healthcare, and housing. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3735.6s)]
*  And housing. The more the government tries to subsidize it, the more the providers realize, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3739.36s)]
*  wait a second, we can charge whatever we want because the government's paying. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3743.36s)]
*  Correct. There's one customer and they'll always pay. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3745.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. There's one customer. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3748.4s)]
*  That's got to be completely reformed. Yeah. Here's a chart of all employees in government. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3749.2s)]
*  And I think this Fred chart includes all employees in government, which would include state and local. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3754.96s)]
*  And as you can see, we're- Yeah, that's right. It's 20 million local and state, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3760.72s)]
*  3 million federal. And then the math I was highlighting was just my back of the envelope [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3764.8s)]
*  math where there's 50 million people that are on social security in the US. Plus, if you do the [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3770.2400000000002s)]
*  math on how government spending flows into employees' pockets, it's about another 45, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3775.36s)]
*  50 million people that benefit from federal spending in the US. We're already kind of at a [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3783.2000000000003s)]
*  point of maximal dependency, if you will. Yeah. I mean, if you look at this chart, we have had [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3787.6000000000004s)]
*  20,000 people working in government since the late 90s. 20 million. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3793.92s)]
*  Yeah. 20 million since the late 90s. It's now hitting a peak. And the question is, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3799.52s)]
*  how far up does it go from here? It's 23. Obviously, the country is growing as well [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3805.04s)]
*  each year. So as a percentage, we don't have the percentage, but as a percentage of Americans, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3809.28s)]
*  it hasn't grown that dramatically, but it certainly feels like this could [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3816.0s)]
*  keep going in the wrong direction. The one thing to keep in mind from all the doomsdaying, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3821.04s)]
*  I would just offer you two data points. The first is that our debt to GDP, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3827.76s)]
*  either historically, but also in relation to other countries, is still relatively reasonable. And what [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3832.96s)]
*  that basically shows is we have a lot more debt that we can issue, which means that there's a lot [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3838.32s)]
*  more deficits to run. Not saying that it's right. Yeah. Before the great financial crisis, it was [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3842.32s)]
*  running at 50, 60% our debt as a percentage of GDP. And to your point, Shamath, it's now at [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3846.72s)]
*  1.2. It's 120%. Other countries have much higher. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3853.9199999999996s)]
*  So we have a lot more to run. Yeah. So Nick, if you want to just throw that up. And so it means [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3858.9599999999996s)]
*  that the countries on the right haven't failed. They haven't done great necessarily, but they [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3863.04s)]
*  haven't failed in the way that we would define failure. And it's not as if the countries on the [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3867.68s)]
*  left are crushing it the way that we would define crushing it. And so it's not clear that [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3871.76s)]
*  there's a real correlation between debt to GDP and the performance over large longitudinal periods [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3877.76s)]
*  of times as a country. That's the first thing I'll say. The second thing is if you actually look at [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3882.48s)]
*  all of these countries, the thing to keep in mind is where are populations growing and shrinking? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3886.8s)]
*  Because at a very basic level, J. Cal, you mentioned this earlier, but when countries [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3891.84s)]
*  are shrinking, there's no fundamental ability to grow GDP. And you're just debating how much it [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3896.8s)]
*  shrinks. And the interesting thing about the United States is we are the only western country [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3901.28s)]
*  that is forecasted to grow at reasonable rates above our replacement population. And so by the [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3910.48s)]
*  end of this century, we'll be around 400, 400 odd million individuals and other countries will have [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3916.7200000000003s)]
*  been cut in half. And so again, there's some positive news as well. Now, to your earlier [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3922.7200000000003s)]
*  point, the problem is politicians will use this as a reason to continue spending [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3929.76s)]
*  because they won't be forced to. And that's not a great thing, but [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3934.4s)]
*  this is probably why the status quo will go on for a very long time. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3938.88s)]
*  So grab the bag, get your bag. Figure out what your thing is. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3945.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know. I just want people like voters to people to just understand. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3950.88s)]
*  Yeah, they're not going to get your bag like everybody else. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3957.44s)]
*  We have is if okay, Nick, can you pull up the Fred spending chart? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3960.2400000000002s)]
*  We've talked about this a few times. Well, okay. So if you look there, there's a huge spike because [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3963.92s)]
*  of COVID because of all that COVID stimulus that was eroded off to the economy. I think we're now [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3968.6400000000003s)]
*  down to about 22% for 2023. But that's a big number. You know, we talked about how the absolute max you [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3973.1200000000003s)]
*  can extract is 20%. So what they should do is just freeze spending until the federal net outlays as [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3980.96s)]
*  a percentage GDP is down to 20%. That would be the simplest. Such an easy solution. It takes out the [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3989.44s)]
*  politicians making this partisan. Hey, there is a logical amount of, you know, taxation we can do [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=3996.8s)]
*  before we freeze up the productivity of the country, which if you talk to anybody, when taxes [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4003.84s)]
*  get high, people just start getting protecting their wealth. I think you alluded to that, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4011.36s)]
*  which strategies as opposed to investing. The hard part of it is that, I mean, look, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4016.1600000000003s)]
*  I think we should do it, you know, 20% cap and free spent until we get there. The hard part is [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4020.56s)]
*  that our interest expense keeps growing because as our debt rolls onto more expensive, higher [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4025.2000000000003s)]
*  interest bonds, then our interest expenses increasing just a few years ago, our interest [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4031.92s)]
*  expenses only 300 billion a year. Now it's over a trillion a year. And that's just going to keep [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4036.7200000000003s)]
*  growing and growing. And then the other thing that's going to grow is all the entitlements related to [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4042.2400000000002s)]
*  to demographics. So the country's demographics are getting worse. And so the entitlement expenses [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4048.1600000000003s)]
*  are going to go up. So even holding it to 20%, if we could get there, it's going to take some work. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4053.44s)]
*  I don't know if you read Larry Fink's letter from BlackRock. It was really good. And he talked about [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4060.48s)]
*  that. You mean his 2030 business plan, J.K.L.? Basically, yeah, it's his way of extracting value [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4065.7599999999998s)]
*  from it. But he did make some salient points in it as opposed to just him talking his book of why [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4070.72s)]
*  you should do your retirement savings with BlackRock is a fair point. But just getting the, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4075.44s)]
*  what age do people retire at? That discussion we need to have. And we're not having that as a [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4080.4s)]
*  country. And then what percentage of benefits do people get at different? How do we incentivize [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4085.6s)]
*  people to stay in the workforce? Well, at a minimum, don't you agree we should just allow [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4089.8399999999997s)]
*  people to opt out of Social Security and in a simple way of saying, I don't need it, and I'll [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4094.0s)]
*  take care of myself, use these proceeds for somebody else that could use it, that who has a better [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4100.16s)]
*  need for it? Yeah, I mean, and then getting people to participate in the 401k is, you know, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4106.32s)]
*  at an earlier age and defaulting those to on as a defaulting them to off, there's a lot of small [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4112.48s)]
*  behavioral things we could do in this country to get people saving earlier. Well, I saw that [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4116.719999999999s)]
*  Robinhood was running a scheme where if you moved your Roth IRA, they gave you 3% cash back. And I [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4123.5199999999995s)]
*  thought, is there an upper bound limit on what on how much you could move over? Because I wonder if [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4129.5199999999995s)]
*  I think you have to keep your money in there for five years. Yeah, but that's okay. I'm just [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4135.2s)]
*  wondering, like, will they really write like $100 million check if you move a $5 billion Roth? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4139.12s)]
*  Robinhood just sent me something. So we had a portfolio company called X1, which was making [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4144.72s)]
*  a new like credit card and credit card app. It was like, awesome. I don't know if you guys used it. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4149.76s)]
*  Anyway, they got acquired by Robinhood. And so the guys are just sent me their new Robinhood [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4155.12s)]
*  gold card card. Yeah, this thing is the heaviest card here. Just listen to it drop. Hold on. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4161.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, don't cut yourself. Don't cut your toe off. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4166.799999999999s)]
*  Apparently, it's got $1,100 worth of gold in it. I have one coming myself. And I'm proud to say I've [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4171.84s)]
*  sold no shares of my Robinhood. I keep all my Robinhood shares. If I move my Roth IRA, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4177.679999999999s)]
*  they'll have to give me the whole building. You give you a gold plated building. Actually, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4182.96s)]
*  they sent it to me in a Louis Vuitton with a Louis Vuitton wallet. This is like, oh, yes, it's got [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4187.2s)]
*  a look. They got a $50,000. And then $50,000. And look at this. Yeah, like a little LV wallet [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4194.24s)]
*  there. Oh, I like they have it, folks send a Louis Vuitton wallet, get a free $50,000 on the pod. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4201.2s)]
*  Sign up now for your Robinhood gold. Yeah, but what is it a credit card? Yes, a credit card. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4207.36s)]
*  It's a credit card. Yeah, their whole plan was always to provide the full suite of services. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4212.32s)]
*  Do you guys carry credit cards and money? Do you have any money? But I always carry money. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4217.44s)]
*  You have money? I always carry money. Yeah, like to tip people or something? [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4224.24s)]
*  Always have some cash each. Never. You always got to have a couple of hundi. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4228.32s)]
*  Just in case. It's a really bad habit. You got to keep a couple of hundi in the bag. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4233.28s)]
*  You put the 100 on the outside, Jake Allen, there's a bunch of ones. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4237.2s)]
*  No, you can't do that. You get caught doing that in Brooklyn. You get your ass. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4241.76s)]
*  Got the Brazil on the outside. No, no, no, no. What we do is we get rid of the ones, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4245.04s)]
*  the fives and the tens. You just get rid of those. You don't even keep them in circulation. That's [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4249.599999999999s)]
*  the best line. I get cash when I go to Vegas. But that's the only time. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4254.639999999999s)]
*  The best line ever was when it comes up to Sammy Davis Jr. and she says, Hey, can you break [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4259.12s)]
*  whatever amount of money? And he just pulls out a hundi and gives her a hundi. And she says, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4269.679999999999s)]
*  No, no, can you make change? She says, That is change, baby. That is change. And that's when [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4275.28s)]
*  he considered change was the hundi. There's a story out of Jeju. So you know, Triton poker? [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4280.48s)]
*  Yes. Okay, I'm not going to say who it is. But there's a guy that was playing the high stakes [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4285.36s)]
*  cash game. And apparently, so he lost like 8 million bucks. Okay. He tipped out 450k and 25k [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4289.2s)]
*  chips to like the staff and like the person giving him a massage and stuff. So it apparently became [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4299.44s)]
*  a free for all trying to get into this game where everybody was like, Are we pulling tips? Are we [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4304.4s)]
*  pulling tips? And they were like, No, we're not pulling tips. Just flags. He was tipping off [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4308.4s)]
*  flags. Wow. That is incredibly, incredibly generous. All right. Science Corner rapid fire. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4314.16s)]
*  You want to get to cocoa. Here we are. We're at cocoa. Freiburg. You have you guys asked about [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4323.04s)]
*  cocoa, you want to pull up the commodity price chart on cocoa? Look at that. Okay. This is not [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4331.36s)]
*  cocaine. This is cocoa. This is chocolate precursor to chocolate. Not this is chocolate. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4336.32s)]
*  As you guys can see from this chart, cocoa is moved in price from about 2000 bucks a ton, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4341.04s)]
*  which is where it normally trades at to $10,000 a ton. 70% of cocoa is grown in West Africa, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4346.16s)]
*  in Ghana and Ivory Coast. And in that area, they've been severely hit by this El Nino [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4355.12s)]
*  weather year that we're just kind of coming out of. So here's all the cocoa production. 73% [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4362.32s)]
*  of it's in Africa, mostly in Ghana and Ivory Coast. That's where most of the world's cocoa [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4367.12s)]
*  beans are produced. Cocoa is grown from the cacao tree, which is about 10 feet tall. These bean pods, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4371.679999999999s)]
*  you take them down, you roast the beans, crush it, you make cocoa. When you eat a Hershey's bar, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4378.24s)]
*  for example, 11% of that bar is ground up cocoa powder. So cocoa is like the critical ingredient, [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4383.04s)]
*  all the chocolate products we consume. So we had this massive El Nino event last year. So here you [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4388.96s)]
*  can see sea surface temperatures. So in Q4 of last year, El Nino spiked like crazy. And that caused [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4393.44s)]
*  a lot of rainfall to hit the West Coast of Africa. And as a result, this fungus was spread in cocoa [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4400.64s)]
*  trees. There's a fungus called Black Pod disease. And this fungus spreads when rainfall hits the [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4406.64s)]
*  ground and it splashes up, gets in the tree. And then the tree has really bad yield and the [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4411.92s)]
*  cocoa production goes down. So now if you look at the cocoa production out of Ghana, you can see [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4417.04s)]
*  that we've seen a 50% rough decline in cocoa production on the final bar chart. So that's [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4421.28s)]
*  the effect. So when that happened, basically everyone started to corner the market. So all [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4428.08s)]
*  the buyers of cocoa went in and started buying cocoa like crazy. And then all the short sellers [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4432.72s)]
*  got squeezed because there's typically a pretty good balance on the short and long side in the [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4437.28s)]
*  market. So then the short sellers got squeezed and it caused this big parabolic jump in price. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4440.4s)]
*  And that's where we're at today. The chocolate companies, again, 11% of chocolate that you're [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4444.88s)]
*  buying at the store is made from this cocoa powder. They're talking about cutting the size of their [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4449.6s)]
*  chocolate bars, raising prices and starting to use other ingredients. So you'll start to see that [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4454.0s)]
*  happen in the shelves in the next couple of months. But this is the big news in the commodity markets [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4458.400000000001s)]
*  right now is this parabolic spike in cocoa prices. And consumers will get hit with high prices and [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4463.12s)]
*  smaller chocolate bars. Isn't there a scene in trading places? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4469.36s)]
*  The OJ futures. That's right. They squeeze the orange market. That's right. That's basically [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4473.52s)]
*  what's happening in cocoa. So there was a bad weather event, yields dropped by 50%. So we got [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4478.88s)]
*  half the production and then all the traders came in and they squeezed the short side of the market [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4483.68s)]
*  and price spike. So that's kind of what's going on. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4488.8s)]
*  If I had a dollar for the number of times a fungus has ruined a good time, man. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4490.96s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, it's interesting. I was looking at this and I was worried [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4496.08s)]
*  about chocolate prices. I was really worried about chocolate prices specifically. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4501.84s)]
*  These edible anus, your anus prices have gone up somehow. So these chocolate, your anus prices [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4510.32s)]
*  are skyrocketing. I just typed in your anus. I typed in freeburg's your anus and chocolate. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4520.32s)]
*  And this came up. It was the number one result. So we know what we mean. There it is. Your anus [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4528.639999999999s)]
*  chocolate prices are going up. I know what I'm getting you guys for Christmas. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4535.28s)]
*  You notice it was priced in euros, not dollars. Yeah. It's not available in America. It was [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4539.36s)]
*  coming from Belgium. I guess they got some serious kink going on over there. That's if you want a [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4543.92s)]
*  chocolate Uranus, it's there for you. I mean, I just was like, Google search chocolate Uranus. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4548.8s)]
*  And yeah, I don't recommend you make that search. If you're listening to the pod. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4557.68s)]
*  When I heard there was a spike in coke prices, it made me think of this. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4563.4400000000005s)]
*  Say hello to my little friend. When's the last time when's the last time you watched [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4571.2s)]
*  square face beginning to end not like just caught a couple of it. I watched it. Yeah, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4577.28s)]
*  it holds up. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, man, it is by the way, I saw it too. Jamal, have you seen it? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4581.759999999999s)]
*  No, no, don't say anything. I need to wait till it comes to see me. Okay, I loved it. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4588.4s)]
*  Going back to see it again. I'm going to see it at IMAX. So you're with me. I didn't hate it. I [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4594.8s)]
*  just think it's overrated. Like Spielberg said it was like one of the greatest moments of his life. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4598.88s)]
*  The greatest movies I've ever seen. I thought it's completely overrated. I'm not saying it's bad. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4602.88s)]
*  It's just not scale a one to 10. Give it a number. I will do anything to have this guy do dune three. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4607.4400000000005s)]
*  He's talking about whether or not he should do it. He's like, I'm only going to do it if it's [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4613.36s)]
*  going to be better than dune to know he's Canadian guy. Yeah, he did Sicario, Sicario and the arrival. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4616.16s)]
*  Like he's honestly one of the top three directors of our villain. No, Denis Villeneuve, the villain [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4623.68s)]
*  is the new. I don't know that the hero in that movie is like this boy type. I mean, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4632.0s)]
*  I don't really believe that he's leading an army. It's not credible. You know, the story I read a [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4638.96s)]
*  lot about, you know, these were all like short stories published in magazines by Frank Herbert. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4645.04s)]
*  And he realized they were serialized and he was really into drugs. He was really into mushrooms. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4650.48s)]
*  And so the spice came around from the mushrooms. It was written in 1965. There was this idea [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4655.76s)]
*  that we needed to move towards zero population growth because the population spike on earth [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4663.280000000001s)]
*  was going to cause resource constraints and we were all going to die if you guys remember this. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4667.280000000001s)]
*  And so there was this big movement. It's what launched the hippie movement. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4672.08s)]
*  Did they not have math back in 1965? Yeah, they really did think this and that there [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4675.76s)]
*  wasn't going to be improvements in productivity. So there were limited resources. The world is [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4680.240000000001s)]
*  going to run out of land and the ecology or the environmentalist movement kind of sprung out of [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4683.68s)]
*  this effort. So a lot of what he wrote about was the ecology and the connection between the fungus [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4689.4400000000005s)]
*  and taking mushrooms and better understanding the world around you. So so much of this was rooted [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4694.72s)]
*  in a hippie movement sacks to your point when he wrote these original short stories. What the [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4699.68s)]
*  spice is in dune? No, and it was tied to never explain why he was interviewed. Herbert was [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4704.96s)]
*  interviewed later. He talked about how it was meant to be about fungus is this the greater of [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4711.6s)]
*  life and this greater of life. And he wanted spice to be representative of mushrooms of fungus, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4716.64s)]
*  psilocybin. It was like it opens your mind and you get more connected with nature and all this [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4721.4400000000005s)]
*  stuff. So it was rooted in that, but they never really get into details on it in the book. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4725.68s)]
*  So this film to you, Freiburg is a 10 out of 10. I'll give it like, okay, I was about to, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4730.160000000001s)]
*  I was going to give it an eight and a half out of 10. I think the first half was slower. I'd say [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4735.68s)]
*  like the second, I mean, like, two months, I'm not ruining anything. I really like Zendaya. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4740.32s)]
*  I think she's super cool. I agree with you, sacks. I'm not a huge Timothée Chalamet fan. I think [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4744.799999999999s)]
*  he's too skinny for me. Is it his name? Is it the name or is it? No, no, no, no, no, I grew up in [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4750.639999999999s)]
*  Canada with a lot of French people. So I'm cool with that. I don't like he's just too skinny. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4754.799999999999s)]
*  Like do a couple pushups or something. It's the vibes. What do you give it sacks? And [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4761.12s)]
*  yeah, I give it an eight and a half. I won't give it a nine. I give it a [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4767.68s)]
*  eight and a half. What do you get a sacks? Give it a nine. I'll give it a six and a half. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4769.76s)]
*  Six and a half. Now, if it had a proper lead, who was more than 120 pounds, who is a good, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4773.68s)]
*  yeah, who's a good lead for you sacks where you would have given it a nine. Exactly the same. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4780.08s)]
*  Everything is the same. Was that a soy boy? Oh, Jake Gyllenhaal. Is it, is that, is that more [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4783.76s)]
*  of a sacks nine? Like ultimate fighting body Jake Gyllenhaal. He's yes. I mean, who Tom Cruise, [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4788.88s)]
*  Ryan Gosling. So what do you think? What movie is a 10 out of 10 for you? I don't know. He's like [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4795.12s)]
*  a young Russell Crowe or something. Right. Don't you? But have you seen the original dune? [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4803.12s)]
*  That guy, if you think that this guy was, oh my God, in a David Lynch movie. Yeah, David Lynch [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4808.96s)]
*  movie. Actually. Yeah. It was a little, I mean, it was similarly, it was like a soft protagonist. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4814.64s)]
*  What is a, what is a nine out of 10 movie? Yeah. What's a 10 out of 10 for you sacks gladiator. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4820.320000000001s)]
*  Goodfellas casino. So car, you know, incredible. So car is incredible. All those are good. All [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4828.08s)]
*  those are good. I know. I give this a seven. I mean, I got to see it again. May I revise it up to a [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4834.0s)]
*  seven, but it's not more than a seven in my book. Isn't there like a Sicario three coming in? [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4839.92s)]
*  I hope so. Sicario one and two are so rewatchable. Oh, it was ultimately watchable. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4844.16s)]
*  Sicario one was unbelievable. Unbelievable. I said, does it for me at the border where you hear the [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4849.92s)]
*  noise of like, what are those locusts? Totally. You know, Oh my God. No, no, when they're in [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4857.28s)]
*  traffic and the cars are parked. Yeah. That's what I mean. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4862.24s)]
*  I'm going to go right out of here. It's like the Bane scene in Dark Knight. Yeah. And, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4866.48s)]
*  and also when he's at the dinner table of the drug lord. Yeah. Oh my God. That's intense. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4872.799999999999s)]
*  Intense. I think that film has probably the best cadence of any modern film. Like the way he kept [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4879.04s)]
*  pace in that film did not turn off for one second. You were hooked from beginning to end and you [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4885.28s)]
*  could watch it. By the way, Godfather was also like that. The pacing in Dune two is terrible. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4890.0s)]
*  I mean, he spends all this time in the wilderness and the [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4894.8s)]
*  You haven't seen it yet. Then why are we talking about? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4900.0s)]
*  Does anyone else think that the arrival is like one of the best films of our generation? [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4906.08s)]
*  No. I mean, it's good, but it's not. I think it's good. Go ahead. It's such a mind blowing film. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4910.64s)]
*  Oh, sacks, you know, maybe, maybe like a young buff Matt Damon. No. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4917.04s)]
*  I don't really see him in the role. Okay. How about, um, what's that guy's name? Adam Driver. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4923.28s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He could do it. He would. Yeah. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4931.12s)]
*  It's kind of like a Kyle McLaughlin type thing. You know, he's a little exactly a little emo. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4936.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But not so skinny. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4941.36s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the idea that he's going to win all these fights and he wastes 120 pounds wet out of [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4944.64s)]
*  the showers makes no sense. Like, yeah, it's his ass. Zendaya does. Doesn't she kick his ass? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4949.52s)]
*  Basically. Yeah. I mean, let's not give it up here. No, that scene with best opening scene [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4956.88s)]
*  of a film. What do you got sacks? What's your best most intense scene? [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4963.76s)]
*  Of any film, any opening scene? I mean, the Joker bank heist scene is incredible. That's good. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4969.52s)]
*  In the shaft of there will be blood. Absolutely. Climbing out of there with the broken leg. Oh, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4977.84s)]
*  Oh my God. That's that's the tone. That's who he is as a person. That's everything. That's your, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4982.8s)]
*  that's your spirit animal. That's it. You're bitter and angry and you have a, you have a competition [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4987.200000000001s)]
*  competition in me. I don't like to see others succeed. I'm David Friedberg. I'd like to see [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=4994.4800000000005s)]
*  the world. Strike, strike, strike. It's true. It's accurate. It's your favorite movie. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=5000.4s)]
*  Just own it. I drink your milkshake. Keep the lie alive. I do have a competition in me. Yeah. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=5015.44s)]
*  It's funny. The only like opening scene of a movie that I really remember is like reservoir dogs. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=5021.2s)]
*  When you talk about like an opening scene, that's memorable. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=5026.719999999999s)]
*  Pulp fiction. Well, no, what was the opening? Oh yeah. The opening scene, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=5030.96s)]
*  Pulp Fiction is pretty good too where they're robbing the diner. Yeah. The diner. It's like, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=5035.04s)]
*  you're hooked on the dialogue right at the beginning. Yeah. Yeah. Probably some Tarantino [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=5038.24s)]
*  movie. There was nothing like that, right? When that came out, you're like, what is this? And then [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=5043.76s)]
*  you're just like, actually the opening scene of Goodfellas is really good where the guy's kicking [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t4YkHSTZbw&t=5046.96s)]
