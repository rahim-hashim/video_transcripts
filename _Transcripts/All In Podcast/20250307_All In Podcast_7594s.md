*  Compressed towards the rest of the S&P 500 and then you're seeing this insane [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=449.1s)]
*  Trade away from Europe. So there's a ton that happened this week. I mean, I don't remember more eventful week Joe [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=454.74s)]
*  Is this a little too much? Maybe you guys missed the shalom Hamas tweet by Trump to which for a lot of us is a big [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=462.98s)]
*  Deal. He said I don't know if this is hello or goodbye, but he's threatening them really strongly [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=469.38s)]
*  So for people who care about that part of the world, it's interesting to watch what's gonna happen. So that also happened [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=473.94s)]
*  Yeah, oh my lord. Well and shalom is hello and goodbye, right? Just to clarify as a word [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=478.82s)]
*  You would say both right? Shut up. Yeah [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=484.18s)]
*  And and P ambiguous word and peace [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=487.62s)]
*  Well, maybe he's leaving it into interpretation maybe they get to pick maybe it's hello [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=492.3s)]
*  That's what he wrote in the tweet oh he did [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=497.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's your choice. Okay, it's a choose your own adventure Hamas from the president United States [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=500.64s)]
*  But I think we should probably get into tariffs [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  This is confounding to most people [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=509.68s)]
*  Maybe since I just did the whole rundown. I won't go into all the details about tariffs again [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=514.04s)]
*  but just [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=519.48s)]
*  Looking at it from first principles Joe. I asked a couple of group chats [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=521.0s)]
*  You're in one one of them in fact [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=525.0s)]
*  And I have about say about 400 people total in these four group chats. What's the strategy here? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=527.72s)]
*  What do you think Trump is trying to accomplish and man I got a range of answers. Let me ask you [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=532.44s)]
*  What is Trump in your estimation? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=537.4000000000001s)]
*  Trying to accomplish with the tariffs on the tariffs off the tariff on the tariff source as Trimont said here [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=540.48s)]
*  This is creating more chaos than any of us have ever seen in markets. Listen Trump's negotiating, right? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=546.2800000000001s)]
*  So I actually ran into David Sacks each senator gets one guest [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=551.36s)]
*  We were both guests in the Senate dining hall hanging out with a bunch of these guys multiple of the guests [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=554.24s)]
*  Some of them were spouses of the centers multiple the guests were people who've lost kids to fentanyl, right? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=559.24s)]
*  And so it's actually is a very serious issue. It's a big thing on the populist, right as it should be for all Americans [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=563.88s)]
*  We've lost, you know tens of thousands of young people recently to fentanyl and and Canada has done nothing about their border [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=569.2s)]
*  And so, you know, you just reported breaking news [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=576.2600000000001s)]
*  I hadn't even heard yet that Mexico might be off. Ken is still on [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=578.32s)]
*  He's using this to negotiate so I talked to the senators and I asked him what's going on because obviously I import things all over [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=581.72s)]
*  The place I'd like to know what the hell the rules are [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=586.84s)]
*  But they wants people to actually crack down on this stuff and save American lives [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=588.6400000000001s)]
*  And I think it's a reasonable thing to use to negotiate and force them to do that. Okay, so you believe it's negotiation [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=592.96s)]
*  Because of the fentanyl issue [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  Chamath, let me go to you because many people are saying this has more to do [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=601.68s)]
*  With some great reset and maybe the 10-year. Do you think this is about fentanyl at the border or something else? I [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=605.64s)]
*  Think that this is the first week where [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=615.0799999999999s)]
*  I've seen the first real schism in [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=619.9599999999999s)]
*  How people are interpreting what's actually happening? I think that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=624.2399999999999s)]
*  Trump and Elon were very much in a honeymoon period until this week and I think there was the benefit of the doubt [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=629.4s)]
*  But what I saw on X was a real [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  divergence where on the one hand there were people that were basically saying [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=639.52s)]
*  Doge is deranged [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=645.04s)]
*  Elon is crazy Trump is lighting the world on fire in one camp [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=646.9599999999999s)]
*  and the other camp saying he's sticking to the plan and [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=651.1999999999999s)]
*  When I [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=655.8399999999999s)]
*  Thought about this a little bit if you went back to November the fifth, I [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=657.28s)]
*  do think it's important to remember that we were at this moment where you had this fork in the road and [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=662.92s)]
*  you had all these important issues where I think the best way to generalize it was that the Democrats believed that [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=669.56s)]
*  the lines [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=676.9599999999999s)]
*  Should continue to be blurred. So whether that was on [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=678.4s)]
*  gender or race or [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=682.0s)]
*  Merit versus some other immutable trait or fiscal and monetary monetary policy things were just getting more and more blurred and [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=684.6s)]
*  Then Trump and Elon basically showed up and said actually we want to refocus and we want to make the lines [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=694.48s)]
*  very visible and clear on all those dimensions and a majority of Americans voted that in [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=701.44s)]
*  but I think what you're starting to see now is [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=708.72s)]
*  The difficulty in actually implementing that plan and [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=711.32s)]
*  What I mean specifically is [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=717.6800000000001s)]
*  Tariffs are very nuanced and complicated on the one hand. There's these short-term wins [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=720.12s)]
*  There's these impacts you could deem them positive or negative to the dollar. There's impacts to US bonds [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=725.6800000000001s)]
*  There's impacts to US bond markets [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=733.36s)]
*  There's impacts to how countries deal with foreign reserves and then there's this impact that happens when the markets react to a tariff and [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=735.6800000000001s)]
*  Then Trump takes that off the table and then they snap back [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=744.48s)]
*  So you have this weird set of boundary conditions right now? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=748.4s)]
*  So I think right now we're in the very difficult part of sorting through [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=753.4s)]
*  What the long-term implications are and I can get to some of them later, but I think that's where we are [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=758.0s)]
*  I think it's really interesting the goal of tariffs in your mind for Trump is [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=762.52s)]
*  fentanyl [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=767.6s)]
*  No finance related. No, no, no, it's give me your definitive what you think this is about [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=768.92s)]
*  I think what tariffs allow us to do is [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=773.28s)]
*  rebase [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=777.24s)]
*  The long-term reliance on the US dollar it allows us to [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=779.68s)]
*  rebase our [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=785.6s)]
*  ability to fund our own deficits and [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=788.0s)]
*  It allows us to rebase [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=790.04s)]
*  the [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=792.36s)]
*  Long-term ability for American companies to be economically vibrant [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=793.8s)]
*  Okay [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=799.0s)]
*  So free Berg we got one person with fentanyl the border negotiating. We got one person on [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=800.08s)]
*  trade [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=806.76s)]
*  Some portion of this I hear and I'm gonna ask in these four group chats. I got he's throwing stuff at the wall the border [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=807.92s)]
*  He's trolling [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=814.84s)]
*  He's trolling the 10-year note and he doesn't care about stocks and then I got [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=816.2s)]
*  on-shoring and [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=822.2800000000001s)]
*  Manufacturing as a possibility. We're gonna make it more expensive to bring things in [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=823.6400000000001s)]
*  So why don't you consider making stuff here? Do you think that third possibility is what's going on here? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=827.32s)]
*  Just David free Berg pick one of these three choices or another what's going on here with tariffs specific [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=832.6400000000001s)]
*  I don't sit inside of Trump's head and I don't have any direct line of communication to folks that are constructing [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=838.08s)]
*  The theory and the policy if I were to say what's the most masterful plan in an optimistic way of what could be going? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=844.44s)]
*  On here. What's the master plan? I would kind of craft it as follows [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=852.44s)]
*  Tariffs aren't being done in isolation. They're being done along with a coordinated policy effort [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=857.84s)]
*  to reduce income taxes and [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=863.9200000000001s)]
*  Another policy effort to reduce government spending. So those are three actions three legs on a stool [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=866.6s)]
*  So tariffs [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=872.8800000000001s)]
*  Reduced income taxes reduced government spending and they are related to each other [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=875.32s)]
*  They're related to each other because if we increase tariffs [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=880.0400000000001s)]
*  One element of that is that to import products is more expensive [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=883.6400000000001s)]
*  For example, I buy LED lights in my greenhouse and the price of the LED lights just went up by 25% [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=888.12s)]
*  This week I actually spoke with the CEO of an LED company and I was like, why don't you guys make the LEDs here? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=894.72s)]
*  And there starts to become a crossover point where it actually makes economic sense for the company to make the LEDs here instead of [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=899.8000000000001s)]
*  sourcing them from Asia and there's a hundred thousand examples of this when the industrial supply chain goes to the lowest part of production [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=907.1800000000001s)]
*  It's gonna end up offshoring when there's no tariffs and if there are tariffs, then you start to do production here [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=915.72s)]
*  So you're increasing both kind of security for the US supply chain [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=921.1600000000001s)]
*  But also increasing demand and creation of a workforce [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=925.74s)]
*  Now I think that the income tax piece is critical here because in order to make the capital [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=931.0600000000001s)]
*  available to build that industry here [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=936.94s)]
*  We need to have unleashed capital and reducing of income taxes [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=939.0200000000001s)]
*  The economic theory would be that capital will now flow into these entrepreneurial activity these opportunities that have emerged [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=942.62s)]
*  Where suddenly it makes sense for me to make textiles to make metals to make materials to make cars to make all this stuff here [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=949.26s)]
*  In the United States that otherwise wouldn't be making so both the corporate and the personal income tax by reducing it unleashes capital [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=955.7399999999999s)]
*  Then instead of going into the government it now goes into the private sector into building businesses [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=961.3s)]
*  Okay, I think that there's another theory about this which is as you drop the income tax [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=966.04s)]
*  One of the kind of key theories that I've heard spoken about a lot lately and I think we're gonna hear about it a lot [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=971.14s)]
*  More this year is trying to get the United States to move away from an income taxation model to a consumption taxation model [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=976.18s)]
*  So effectively what the tariffs do is there's a tax for you buying certain things [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=982.78s)]
*  So now instead of getting taxed when you earn money as an individual you get taxed when you spend money [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=987.06s)]
*  And some people think that that's both a more fair system and a more kind of economically vibrant system because that will drive [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=993.08s)]
*  Investment in the things that people want to produce because the money's going into production [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1000.54s)]
*  So I think that do you think that free break? I'm curious. I don't know. It's a really interesting economic theory [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1005.34s)]
*  I mean I am NOT opposed to seeing some sort of an experiment play out [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1010.8199999999999s)]
*  Where we look at a shift from income taxation to consumption taxation and see if it actually does have an effect on economic growth [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1015.98s)]
*  And productivity it has not been done in 150 years [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1023.06s)]
*  There's a lot of economic theorists on both sides of the equation saying this does work or it doesn't work [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1025.62s)]
*  Okay [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1030.82s)]
*  And let me just say one last thing by reducing government spending we are moving workers [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1031.1s)]
*  From the government into the private workforce [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1037.02s)]
*  So as those new industries pop up as those investments start to get made in building new industry onshore [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1039.76s)]
*  Where are the workers gonna come from remember the government's 30% of the US GDP today? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1044.9399999999998s)]
*  So if that's not a great way to invest money [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1049.54s)]
*  Maybe the private industry is better at investing money and employing people that will unleash the workforce and it will counterbalance [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1052.06s)]
*  The inflation that we're experiencing so there's a lot of inflation because of tariffs and by reducing government spending that's the offset to inflation [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1058.02s)]
*  So those three actions I think are three legs of a stool and they actually are all interrelated to one another [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1064.98s)]
*  So that would be my grand master theory of what might be going on [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1070.3s)]
*  This is an interesting triangulation theory that people have been speculating about and [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1072.96s)]
*  There are a couple of caveats here Joe number one. We do have [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1077.46s)]
*  lowering income tax and lowering services experiment. It's called Florida [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1081.3s)]
*  Texas and a couple of the states where they have lower income tax and more consumption tax [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1086.06s)]
*  We pay a lot more in real estate taxes here something we consume putting that aside [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1090.38s)]
*  The really interesting issue is we're at the lowest unemployment of our lifetime [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1096.22s)]
*  4% where are all these workers gonna come from? What do you think Joe now that you've heard the two other [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1101.02s)]
*  panelists here discuss it [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1106.22s)]
*  What are we trying to get to where is the destination at the end of this term? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1108.9s)]
*  Trump's lame duck. He can go wild here. He's not running for reelection [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1115.58s)]
*  and you know, what what do you think he wants to see do you think he just wants to [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1119.38s)]
*  Cement some sort of legacy and if so, what's that legacy and how do these actions equal his goals and legacy? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1124.58s)]
*  No, listen [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1132.1000000000001s)]
*  I agree with what David with what David was saying Jason and it's it's a really important point [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1132.7s)]
*  Also that we should mention is that the last four years the economy's looked okay [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1136.78s)]
*  But part of that is because government's been hiring like mad [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1140.54s)]
*  And so the point he made is that actually, you know having twice as many people, you know harassing me [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1142.98s)]
*  I just got back yesterday no action on an audit that's been harassing me on for three years [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1148.82s)]
*  They found nothing having twice as many people doing things like that and or like, you know [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1152.22s)]
*  Running TSA or pushing papers around in the Department of Labor [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1156.26s)]
*  Doesn't actually add output to the economy. And so, you know, it does seem like it makes a lot of sense [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1159.54s)]
*  Let's take a million workers out of the consulting class around these DC out of the you know [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1164.5s)]
*  Paper-pushing class around DC and let's actually deploy them to the actual productive economy [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1169.86s)]
*  Elon and Trump have both been saying that I think David's a hundred percent, right? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1173.82s)]
*  It is true. A lot of my companies thinks that the tariff stuff are looking to build stuff here [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1177.06s)]
*  So I'm not a huge fan of tears personally, but this they definitely make sense for things in defense [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1181.32s)]
*  They definitely make sense for negotiating with countries and it is true [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1186.06s)]
*  It is pushing certain people to including me to build some more things in America [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1188.86s)]
*  Here's where terrorists make a lot of sense if you have markets where there are domestic alternatives and [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1192.54s)]
*  Or where things are fundamentally commodity [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1198.9s)]
*  There's no reason why tariffs can't work to create the incentives to redomisal [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1201.8200000000002s)]
*  Economic productivity inside of the United States. That's a that's a slam dunk. I think and in Shemoff [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1207.22s)]
*  There's another twist on that too, which I think we should all acknowledge is that America does have some really tough environmental laws [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1212.3s)]
*  Despite what Jason may think of me. I actually don't want my daughters growing up with your messy air messy water, you know screwed up country [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1217.46s)]
*  Oh, I know that you're a nature guy [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1223.8s)]
*  But here's like a classic Bush nature guy, but but here's here's the thing in China and Indonesia and all these other countries [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1226.62s)]
*  They are just over the environment as they make things [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1232.7s)]
*  I think tariffs are very reasonable in that case [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1235.32s)]
*  Like it's not fair to make it more expensive for us because we're doing it well [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1237.42s)]
*  And then we outsource it for them to destroy things, right? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1240.34s)]
*  So so there are some things there where it does and and what I would say is the other [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1242.5s)]
*  The other side of the of the tariff knife is that if there are markets though where you're making something that's fundamentally innovative [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1246.34s)]
*  Where you are but one maker the problematic part of where tariffs [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1254.78s)]
*  Really affect the US consumer is then the price of that product of which there are no competitive alternatives [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1260.58s)]
*  Can go very very high and that's inflationary and I think that that slows down [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1267.74s)]
*  Consumption and then if that consumption is not just of something that's a nice to have but a must-have then it becomes problematic [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1273.5s)]
*  And so you could see where tariffs could impact [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1280.42s)]
*  certain industries [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1283.9s)]
*  For example if there are innovative drugs, I think that that's problematic if there are innovative technologies of which there's only one vendor [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1286.22s)]
*  That's problematic. So all of those need to get sorted out [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1292.82s)]
*  But on balance in commodity markets like look at autos autos is a perfect example [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1296.14s)]
*  there are so many purveyors and [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1301.18s)]
*  providers of autos there's OEMs all around the world and so to have a [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1304.94s)]
*  Compensatory system [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1311.1399999999999s)]
*  Doesn't seem like an unreasonable thing where it's a tit-for-tat tariff, but in other markets where if you need for example a [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1313.86s)]
*  specific piece of equipment from a SML to build a chip and [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1321.86s)]
*  Now all of a sudden that that machine is 25% more expensive or 30% more expensive and they pass that cost downstream [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1325.62s)]
*  It becomes very [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1333.58s)]
*  Speculative and it becomes a little bit more fragile. I think this is dangerous [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1336.18s)]
*  The right your mouth because I agree with you in theory [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1339.76s)]
*  But then there's something where you know if everyone's lobbying for their thing to be an exception you end up getting this very crony [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1342.0s)]
*  System it's that you don't necessarily want right? So you have to be very careful how you define these things exactly [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1347.56s)]
*  So this is why the I think like sector by sector [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1352.8s)]
*  It's probably you can probably go and pass the smell test and say if there are multiple providers and or if it's somehow commodity [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1355.5s)]
*  I [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1362.92s)]
*  Think it's easier to absorb the tariff in the short term [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1364.24s)]
*  Maybe that's the right way to say it which is if you believe if Trump believes everything should be tariffed [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1367.0s)]
*  then instead of debating if to your point maybe the right thing to debate is when and [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1372.28s)]
*  You have to put some things on a much longer glide path [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1377.44s)]
*  So that you don't just create inflation out of nowhere and or you don't hold back American business or American consumers [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1380.8s)]
*  Well, this is a key point because you do need to have predictability to make investment and reciprocity [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1388.48s)]
*  Really two important points two months making here one on reciprocity these things haven't been looked at for a while [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1393.96s)]
*  I'm not sure how they got so out of whack [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1399.44s)]
*  But just putting some facts to this [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1401.24s)]
*  Chamath's exactly correct. We get placed when we send cars to the EU think they get a 10% tariff, but [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1403.96s)]
*  When we get their cars, it's a two and a half percenter who let it get out of whack [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1410.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure but why not make the reciprocity perfect and just hey you say ten we say ten you say two and a half [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1414.72s)]
*  And that would make I think a lot more sense just to put some numbers here on government employees [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1421.36s)]
*  It's not as bad as people make it out to be a lot of our spending is non-employee related [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1427.32s)]
*  But it is if you look over the last two administrations [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1433.76s)]
*  We have added million two million three employees across all I disagree that hold on [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1436.56s)]
*  Let me just finish the sentence so you have the facts and that you can disagree with the facts [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1442.04s)]
*  one point three million additional employees added [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1445.04s)]
*  This does not include contractors and so we don't know what USA was doing with NGOs and contractors [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1449.2s)]
*  And I think that's where we do need to get some clarity and to Chamath's point [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1454.98s)]
*  This has all got to become predictable [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1459.6399999999999s)]
*  You cannot put tariffs on off every week or else [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1461.3999999999999s)]
*  How does your friend Dave who wants to do the LED lighting where you're encouraging to do it? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1464.96s)]
*  LED lighting know if they should build a factory and invest 10 million in that [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1469.84s)]
*  You disagree with the number of employees you want to adjust that? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1474.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, look the government accounts for 30% of GDP in the United States, that's an extraordinary sum [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1476.96s)]
*  So just I was talking just about the employees. That's a much smaller percent [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1482.96s)]
*  But that doesn't matter the direct employees of federal agencies is a fraction of people that are employed indirectly by government spending [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1486.76s)]
*  This is super important. Sure as we all know many government agencies write checks to large contractors [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1494.5s)]
*  Subcontractors and third-party service providers that do the work for them [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1501.8s)]
*  So the money gets transferred they then employ the people and they do the work [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1505.1599999999999s)]
*  So it doesn't technically show up on federal government payroll [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1508.6799999999998s)]
*  Registers, but these are people that are indirectly employed by federal spending [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1511.56s)]
*  that's super important to acknowledge that a large percentage of the US workforce is [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1516.1999999999998s)]
*  Indirectly supported by federal dollars. Yeah, it's got a mess [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1521.04s)]
*  It's got massively with the NGOs to so you've had about 4 million people employed by contractors in DC [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1524.9199999999998s)]
*  1.6 million more at the States actually by federal by federal spending and then you have the NGOs [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1529.58s)]
*  No one knows the NGOs by the administration took down the data [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1535.1s)]
*  I used to see things in 2020 so we don't even know how much money but we know it was hundreds of billions [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1537.8999999999999s)]
*  So it's pretty crazy. The number one thing about how Doge is not being done fully [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1542.1799999999998s)]
*  Is that Elon is doing an amazing job, you know [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1547.34s)]
*  Whether or not he cuts 500 billion or trillion or a lot more [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1549.76s)]
*  But the senators and the congressmen are not willing to take it out of their bill the reconciliation bill right now [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1552.34s)]
*  There's talking about cutting one to two trillion. So rather than like this is over ten years. It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1557.94s)]
*  If it was equal to what Elon was doing it'd be at least five trillion dollars [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1564.02s)]
*  I push a bunch of them they say oh the Congressional Budget Office and all these things [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1566.66s)]
*  I'm sure there's some tough things there. But like this is crazy [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1569.94s)]
*  We need to see what these cuts need to be on Doge and we need to cut five trillion [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1572.74s)]
*  And none of these people have the balls to do that is there's not the political will to do it is my interpretation [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1576.3s)]
*  Cajones, let me just show you one chart to back that up. I have my new disc rassi ad [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1581.6200000000001s)]
*  Com for the week look at this Chema. I want to talk about software and waste [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1586.46s)]
*  35,000 [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1592.66s)]
*  855 according to Doge breaking news [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1594.8200000000002s)]
*  Service now licenses on three products only being used by 84 people. Oh my kidding me [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1598.74s)]
*  11,000 Acrobat licenses with 0.0 users this classy odd [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1607.46s)]
*  Absolutely [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1613.58s)]
*  Abhorrent and I'm saying it right now. I want an investigation into procurement who sold this who bought it? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1615.22s)]
*  This could be a crime. This could be fraud. That could be kickbacks. I'm saying it could be I don't think it's not [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1622.8999999999999s)]
*  But I do think you have to look at the earnings of these companies in question. Where's all the correct? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1627.54s)]
*  Number two totally if service now ever wants to work with the government again, mr. President [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1633.54s)]
*  Mr. President our president [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1640.26s)]

*  If they don't pay us back that money and give us a credit hold on hold on this band forever. Hold on [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1649.3s)]
*  It's not thank you. Mr. President. This may not be service now's fault [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1653.54s)]
*  This may be the ineptitude of the people of the license, but they should still give us a credit [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1656.74s)]
*  I want the money back for the American people. I do think Adobe has the worst have you guys ever done Adobe subscriptions? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1660.58s)]
*  They're impossible to cancel. I think it don't [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1665.94s)]
*  The only thing harder than canceling an Adobe license is trying to cancel Wall Street Journal [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1668.46s)]
*  I was about to say Wall Street Journal. That's the worst [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1672.42s)]
*  Let me just say something about the the budget because Joe brings up something important unbelievable [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1676.6200000000001s)]
*  I'll just say it again at the sake of being redundant [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1682.9s)]
*  We're getting to the phase where the details are complicated and they now matter [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1685.66s)]
*  So we've talked about repealing the IRA in its totality [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1689.7s)]
*  We've talked about repealing the IRA in its totality, right? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1694.34s)]
*  So that was a statement and there's there's theoretically a lot of money there [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1698.5s)]
*  But the details now all of a sudden become complicated [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1703.26s)]
*  FERC published a report just this past week and [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1707.1799999999998s)]
*  What do you think it said was the percentage of? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1711.54s)]
*  Incremental electricity that was generated from renewables versus non renewables. Okay, I'll tell you the answer [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1716.02s)]
*  It was almost 91% in December. So if you now tie [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1721.56s)]
*  Two huge initiatives together, which is how do we find a budget that saves money? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1726.56s)]
*  And how do we continue to win an AI? Maybe you would have thought those weren't related [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1731.48s)]
*  well, guess what we know that AI needs a tremendous amount of power and [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1737.12s)]
*  Whatever you thought you knew actually you had to re underwrite because what Elon has shown is actually you need to now create these mega [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1742.84s)]
*  clusters [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1750.2s)]
*  100,000 GPU is going to a million GPUs all of the power forecasting that we have is [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1751.8000000000002s)]
*  Miscast it doesn't even account for this [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1757.28s)]
*  Number one number two. There are 35,000 applications [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1759.68s)]
*  into FERC [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1764.6000000000001s)]
*  To get approved to generate electricity [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1766.64s)]
*  35,000 that's going to meander through some administrative rigmarole [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1770.28s)]
*  There is a five-year delay to get a gas turbine into America and online [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1774.64s)]
*  Okay, if you ordered one today the fastest that you can get it turned on is 2030 [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1781.0400000000002s)]
*  The fastest that you can get nuclear turned on is 2035 [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1786.6000000000001s)]
*  So we don't have the ability to generate incremental electricity very quickly [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1790.24s)]
*  But for renewables, but then if you rip out the IRA [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1795.28s)]
*  There's many parts of the IRA by the way that are just trash Nick [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1799.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if you can find it but Barry Weiss found this [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1803.28s)]
*  Insane thing that made me so angry which I'm happy to talk about which was like a 30-day grant process [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1806.08s)]
*  That resulted in a seven billion dollar grant to some shell and this was throwing the gold bars [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1811.8s)]
*  But the other part of the IRA this narrow part is what it did to reinforce tax incentives and tax equity [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1818.56s)]
*  Which is a 200 billion dollar market that incentivizes that 90% of energy generation [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1826.6s)]
*  So my point is that when you start to get into the details when the houseways and means community has to figure out [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1832.46s)]
*  What part to put back this is going to be hard because it's like hold on if you've got the whole thing [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1840.3000000000002s)]
*  Now all of a sudden you take 90% of the incremental energy generation incentives out of the market [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1845.8200000000002s)]
*  You don't have enough electrons. There isn't enough electricity. So then you lose the AI race. So you start to lose it [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1850.8600000000001s)]
*  I think the point is that we're now in the hard part where the details really matter [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1856.78s)]
*  Listen you got to start with the chainsaw. We saw that at Twitter [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1861.42s)]
*  Maybe you do like we started this he just tweeted this out. He said guys now it's time to get surgical [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1865.74s)]
*  He then he said yes [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1870.74s)]
*  That was the metaphor is about to use is like, you know [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1872.0600000000002s)]
*  You start with you cut out the goddamn service now in Adobe subscriptions and then you work on something, you know more deaf [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1874.3200000000002s)]
*  And maybe that's where we are. I are a just for the audience inflation reduction [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1880.9s)]
*  Can I just do a rant on this on this pop-up NGO thing to me? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1885.22s)]
*  This is like the worst of America and it makes me so angry and I'll tell you my lived experience [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1889.56s)]
*  So I'm on the other side of this [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1894.0s)]
*  I started a company with these guys from Tesla to make battery materials in the United States in [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1894.96s)]
*  2019 [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1901.3999999999999s)]
*  We grind we grind we put in 10. I put in tens of millions of dollars. We get a deal with a big OEM and [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1902.84s)]
*  Then you see these DOE grants [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1909.9199999999998s)]
*  We spent millions of dollars. We file a very detailed plan to build battery metals and battery capacity in America [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1912.52s)]
*  We got rejected [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1920.48s)]
*  Okay, it was an entire year-long process. We got rejected [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1922.08s)]
*  We put it past us. We kept working. We found more deals [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1925.6799999999998s)]
*  We found a way to survive raise a little bit more money and then we applied again on [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1929.8999999999999s)]
*  Some success and we got a hundred million dollar grant. Okay, that was that's what just happened this year [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1935.3999999999999s)]
*  But then yesterday I read and Nick maybe you can throw this tweet up this Barry Weiss [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1942.58s)]
*  investigation [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1947.56s)]
*  Somebody in 30 days who was connected to the Democratic infrastructure [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1949.12s)]
*  Had some shell organization that got a grant that was [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1954.1599999999999s)]
*  70 times bigger than us [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1957.76s)]
*  Like we've made stuff. We have deals with OEMs [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1960.1599999999999s)]
*  We had to validate it every step of the way we were rejected once so our process to get a hundred million dollar [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1964.08s)]
*  DOE program [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1969.7199999999998s)]
*  Was two years these people showed up in 30 days and got seven billion [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1971.1999999999998s)]
*  That's just why why didn't you put why don't you lead with DEI or something you would have gotten a billion [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1976.64s)]
*  You just led with the wrong thing you were providing a product or service people [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1982.32s)]
*  This is this is why they're coming in there for the minerals. This is why it's so frustrating to build for the government guys [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1986.76s)]
*  This is what Palantir and SpaceX had to deal with it's why they both sued the government [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1993.1000000000001s)]
*  Is that all the friends who used to be the CIO used to be the general? [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1996.1200000000001s)]
*  Made the right donations had the right kid on the board [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=1999.72s)]
*  It's all corrupt and then it's actual substantive people you have to work like how they give seven billion dollars in 30 days [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2002.28s)]
*  What we're gonna find out you got a bunch of democratic on the board. Well, let me challenge you guys on one point [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2008.76s)]
*  There are now claims being made by reporters and by third parties that are saying it is a new form of kleptocracy [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2014.92s)]
*  with all the friends of Silicon Valley installing their friends and [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2022.6399999999999s)]
*  Agency heads as undersecretaries and so on that's gonna benefit Silicon Valley investors Silicon Valley companies Joe [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2027.32s)]
*  Chema J Cal [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2035.0s)]
*  I mean, how do you guys react to the claims that there's now, you know, this new kind of kleptocratic movement? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2036.2s)]
*  It's the old guard is gone [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2041.8s)]
*  You have Palantir you have Andrew also go ahead you you answer. Let's let's talk about this [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2044.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean when we go to DC when I go to DC what I am asking is I want there to be a fair competition [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2048.64s)]
*  And if I win I want my company to actually be able to win the contract because the way it worked for 20 years [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2053.7999999999997s)]
*  Like like EPROS you just raised 250 million dollars this week. It's a great company [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2059.2s)]
*  We've you know, we have big contests four years ago l3 Raytheon Northrop these guys, you know in and out of government for decades [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2063.04s)]
*  They've gotten tens of billions of dollars to the same technology area when we went head-to-head with them [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2069.52s)]
*  We didn't just like beat them by a little bit [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2074.24s)]
*  We shot down the hardened drones nine and a half times farther away same size same power nine have to completely wipe the floor [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2076.1s)]
*  The cost difference between the bids like are you saving us a massive money massive money [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2081.7599999999998s)]
*  I invested only 30 40 and the whole thing at that point and they spent billions and we have much cheaper much better [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2086.24s)]
*  not even a question and and you talk to the and you talk to like at the time the [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2091.04s)]
*  Chiefest staff of the Air Force the guy I run the four-star and and he says well Joe this was written three years ago [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2095.2s)]
*  It looks like Raytheon probably did help write it and they required all these things and your way you're doing it [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2100.2s)]
*  Like I'm like, yeah, I'm using a chip instead of a cathode ray tube [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2104.64s)]
*  That's why it's working so much better [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2107.16s)]
*  It was written for the way they're doing it and I could overrule it but it break a lot of glass [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2108.4s)]
*  So you'll probably win again in three years because everyone knows you're the best but it's too [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2112.5400000000004s)]
*  It's too frustrating [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2115.6000000000004s)]
*  You know too stressful to give it to you right now like that is that so so what I'm doing is I'm not going and [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2116.6400000000003s)]
*  Saying give my company's money [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2121.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm saying I'm saying make this actually a functional logical process and give me a chance to win it from the best and that that is [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2122.28s)]
*  A hundred times better for our country to push in. How do you but how do you make that transparent? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2128.2000000000003s)]
*  And how do you avoid there has to be massive transparency? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2132.32s)]
*  Avoid the perception of conflict and the perception of kleptocracy [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2134.88s)]
*  Well, it's acquisition. It's acquisition reform, right? [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2139.4s)]
*  So like this is the really important story you guys probably know we were in the Philippine jungles in early 1910s [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2141.5600000000004s)]
*  Needed new pistols or pistols were terrible. They have like a one-page thing what they needed. There's six are manufacturers competed [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2146.1600000000003s)]
*  That's how we got the Colt 1911 in like three months one by the bite by a large mount. It's an awesome gun at [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2151.9s)]
*  12 years ago [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2158.36s)]
*  We had a seven hundred something page document that the bureaucrats spent years on outlining what they needed for a new pistol [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2159.2000000000003s)]
*  Probably needed to do DEI stuff. I have no idea. It's like a long comical document [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2164.6s)]
*  They still don't have a new pistol today [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2168.58s)]
*  And so the way we do it is we have a very clear process where it's very specific on the outcomes [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2170.08s)]
*  Not on the inputs and you know a contest and and then and then you make sure that you know, it's not it's obvious who wins [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2176.04s)]
*  Guys, it's not like we're like slightly better. It's like we're shaming them [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2181.7599999999998s)]
*  So the only way they can stop us is by playing these games because we're just so much better. I [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2184.36s)]
*  Think that if you're in the administration or if you [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2190.08s)]
*  Join some part of the administration whether you're a full-time employee or a GSE or just a volunteer [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2194.12s)]
*  There's going to be that perception of impropriety or influence peddling that comes with the territory. So how do you avoid it? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2201.56s)]
*  And I think that Joe is exactly right when the administration was getting formed one of the things that happened [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2208.64s)]
*  I had an opportunity to work with some of the folks [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2215.2s)]
*  To write some proposals for what theoretically could happen in some of these bigger government organizations where there's just [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2217.68s)]
*  huge pockets of spend and [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2223.3199999999997s)]
*  Where I spent most of my time is what Joe talked about. How do you create? [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2225.12s)]
*  open standards [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2229.48s)]
*  So that it's very clear what the competition is so that the rules on the ground [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2231.04s)]
*  can't get manipulated by people who are rolling out of government into private industry or [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2236.52s)]
*  Somebody has a very deep relationship because of lobbying [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2242.56s)]
*  Those are the things that pervert the clarity of what should happen because then what happens can be far afield of that [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2245.8799999999997s)]
*  So number one is I think knowing that this time around a different class of people are going to be seen on the quote-unquote [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2252.08s)]
*  popular side [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2260.16s)]
*  It's really critical that all of us that are involved in this [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2261.7200000000003s)]
*  promote extremely transparent open standards publish every RFP publish every spec [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2266.76s)]
*  Publish every evaluation criteria make these things as mechanistic as possible [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2273.52s)]
*  So for example, if you're gonna go and feel the drone [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2278.52s)]
*  There's an incredibly detailed set of data that you should be publishing in [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2282.84s)]
*  it's not dissimilar to how an FAA asks for flight test data and you should be able to [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2286.92s)]
*  review that so that then it can be escalated so that if somebody then gets a deal because of preference and [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2292.96s)]
*  You think you're structurally better on the data [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2298.68s)]
*  There needs to be an escalation and a release valve that says hold on [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2301.64s)]
*  This is just being manipulated and I think that's how you fight back [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2304.8s)]
*  Yeah on not just this version of a potential winning side versus losing side [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2308.4s)]
*  but forever in the future the government should be open the government should be transparent and [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2313.36s)]
*  Every single point at which they're making a decision and giving money should be measurable and known you guys got exactly right. There's transparency [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2319.76s)]
*  There's oversight obviously but there's [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2328.0s)]
*  Whistleblowers as well and there's the role of the press in all of this to sort of fact-check it and to check in on it as [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2330.8s)]
*  A safeguard with the public getting engaged and that's one of the great things that doge has done by having a Twitter handle [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2337.48s)]
*  I can pull up. Hey, here's what's going on with these licenses and make an example [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2344.12s)]
*  So that kind of transparency helps and then finally we have to look at campaign finance [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2348.2400000000002s)]
*  That is where a lot of the appearance [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2353.68s)]
*  Exists go back to this other thing because that's a super important point [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2356.74s)]
*  Like it just occurred to me that if what you said happens then look the incentive today in America [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2360.14s)]
*  Is to try to position oneself to have one of these roles and [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2366.02s)]
*  The reason is because David of what you said there is the chance to then [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2370.7s)]
*  Preferentially nudge an opportunity your way, right? Yes. Why do people sit on committees? Why do people? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2375.38s)]
*  volunteer [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2383.3399999999997s)]
*  At least at that level and [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2384.5s)]
*  If you introduce open standards [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2386.82s)]
*  Then the real incentive to want to go do this should be because you actually are patriotic and want to just help [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2389.7400000000002s)]
*  So Chamath, I think I think you're right about the standards [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2394.9s)]
*  But I want to push back on the incentive today [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2397.16s)]
*  I know a lot of the people who are getting into this and I really do think they're there to fight for the country [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2398.94s)]
*  I don't say this like like, you know, I'm naively or something like these people really are there for the right reasons for the most [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2404.68s)]
*  Part no, I know I'm just saying generally over like the last 50 years if you look at people there is this implied sense [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2409.98s)]
*  Like for example, like Goldman Sachs had a direct line to become Treasury Secretary [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2415.68s)]
*  If you were the CEO of Goldman, you were the Treasury Secretary now [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2419.62s)]
*  don't you think that that was discussed amongst partners at Goldman and [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2423.94s)]
*  Do we not think on the margins that that beneficially helped Goldman? Of course it did we'd be we'd be naive to think otherwise [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2427.42s)]
*  My point is not that my point is just that going forward the best thing all of our friends could do is [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2433.18s)]
*  Just make it all open source and open standards. That would be an incredible artifact. I think for America Joe [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2439.18s)]
*  I think you telling us hey, I trust these people there are friends, you know that works with all of us because yes [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2445.34s)]
*  We know them we know they're gonna do the stand-up right thing [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2450.18s)]
*  And if you already have a ton of money like some incremental amount money is not going to move the needle for you [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2452.62s)]
*  It's it's it's farcical for us to think that David Sachs is gonna give up [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2457.08s)]
*  Four years of income producing have to sell all his positions and that is in some way good for his balance sheet [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2460.86s)]
*  It is not he's gonna miss out on four years of AI and the massive run-up of our lifetime in order to serve the country [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2466.86s)]
*  but I can tell you people don't believe that just like you know, you talked about the [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2473.7200000000003s)]
*  Kleptocracy and the revolving door to Raytheon or whoever that people have talked about forever. What you need is whistleblower protections [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2479.06s)]
*  Journalists going after this like Barry Weiss is doing old-school [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2487.3s)]
*  journalism investigative [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2491.6600000000003s)]
*  The whistleblower laws are great in our country we need to keep reinforcing those but I'm gonna go back to [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2493.38s)]
*  We need to limit campaign contributions [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2499.86s)]
*  we have to get rid of super PACs because these create the appearance of [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2501.86s)]
*  Impropriety and the appearance of impropriety with Trump's mean coin and that announcement on Sunday for the crypto reserve [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2505.54s)]
*  Was you know, it doesn't help the mission here that Trump is trying to get done [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2511.6600000000003s)]
*  So maybe you could speak to that because that's where the appearance of impropriety is great [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2517.02s)]
*  You got people like sailor who's doing his Bitcoin thing. He's going on Friday and you know, Sax will [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2520.9s)]
*  Do a do a little bit here and announce some stuff on the program. Hopefully [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2527.1s)]
*  but maybe you could talk about what you objected to with [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2531.62s)]
*  the coins the meme coin and or the the announcement of the crypto reserve should our government and [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2535.1800000000003s)]
*  After all this donations from massive people like I saw at the crypto ball all the people who were tweeted by Trump that looks terrible [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2542.94s)]
*  Yeah, you're telling me what to think. I agree with you on the tweet. You're sneaking two things together here though [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2550.9s)]
*  So I want to be really precise Jason because let's be precise. That's what we do here [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2555.28s)]
*  There are a lot of different possible ways that people can help politicians [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2558.6600000000003s)]
*  And so one of them is if you're a celebrity like even all your guys show at this point [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2563.3s)]
*  You can you can act effect what people think that's a little powerful same [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2567.6s)]
*  Yeah, there's there's other ways that if you're part of a big union, you're part of a government union [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2570.5s)]
*  That's a very powerful [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2575.12s)]
*  You know influence in our society if you're part of American Medical Association health care system [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2576.56s)]
*  There the doctors and health systems are very powerful even without super PACs in our society and what a super PAC is [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2580.98s)]
*  It's a form of free speech and it's true wealthy people [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2586.12s)]
*  Have the ability to influence things through that speech, but it's like one of many [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2589.2s)]
*  And so if you're cutting that you're basically saying okay [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2593.16s)]
*  I don't want Elon and Joe to have as much say there [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2595.08s)]
*  But I do want to have even more say for the celebrities and for the doctors and for the union members and government [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2598.0s)]
*  So you have to realize you're dealing with a complicated situation with lots of forms of power [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2603.08s)]
*  I do agree with you as I said and listen, I saw David and we gave each other a hug [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2606.3199999999997s)]
*  I think we're all good, but I was very frustrated with [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2610.36s)]
*  Posts of Trump mentioning specific coins. I don't know who was trading them before it just looks bad [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2613.52s)]
*  Like we're finding all this grift reading all these things where we have the moral high ground [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2618.2s)]
*  I agree [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2621.04s)]
*  I don't want to give up the moral high ground with these with these silly schemes that that that's a hundred percent the case [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2621.96s)]
*  Are you saying with like there's many forms of influence that you think super PACs and rich people should be able to I think speech [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2625.88s)]
*  Is important I think million dollar twenty million dollar donations. You'd actually think that's fair for democracy [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2632.32s)]
*  I actually I actually think speech is very important. I think the ability for me to send out something and say guys [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2637.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm studying this it's corrupt. It's been corrupt for 50 years [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2642.06s)]
*  We have to all get together and stand against these health systems these crazy defense companies that have kept her and broke everything [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2645.2000000000003s)]
*  Like I think my ability to speak and do that and to convince people is really valuable [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2650.52s)]
*  And I and I've you know [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2654.6400000000003s)]
*  I passed dozens of laws each year in these different states by convincing people [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2655.5s)]
*  Nothing to do with making me money that these incentives and accountability are wrong [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2659.24s)]
*  I think that's a good thing that I'm allowed to do that [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2662.6s)]
*  Should they be good? So when you say speech you mean write a check you mean right? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2665.0s)]
*  It's not very large checks. You have to be careful that so the reason the Supreme Court ruled for super PACs [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2668.72s)]
*  It's not just about giving you're not you're not giving them the money. You're actually speaking yourself [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2673.06s)]
*  So when Elon spends 300 million dollars, he's actually spending it many times putting out his own [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2676.7599999999998s)]
*  Speech or he's putting out so you believe what about you? [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2683.2799999999997s)]
*  You think that Soros Elon let's take the names out of it [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2686.08s)]
*  Do you think there should be a cap on what you're able to donate to super PACs because this does create the massive appearance of impropriety [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2689.96s)]
*  Whether it's in crypto whether it's on the you know Soros on the Democrat side [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2696.0s)]
*  This seems to be I mean I'm in favor of there being more hard caps whether it's 510 or 25 million [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2700.64s)]
*  I think there needs to be caps [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2706.8s)]
*  I think we should put a fund together for the last two or three people and let them get that money from the government [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2707.68s)]
*  It's to run their campaigns like other countries do [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2712.4s)]
*  I think it's important to note that this pendulum has [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2716.0s)]
*  Swung pretty wildly out of wax in Citizens United [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2720.36s)]
*  Yeah, and it's not this is not a Republican thing meaning there's a whole bunch of factions. There's the George Soros faction [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2724.32s)]
*  Yeah, true. There's the liberal Democrat faction lest we forget. I think Zuck spent 350 million in 2020 [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2731.32s)]
*  oh, yeah, then there's the Koch Brothers faction and [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2738.52s)]
*  Then there's what showed up this year with Elon [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2743.48s)]
*  So my point is there's all kinds of pockets of spending in all manner of ways [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2746.32s)]
*  I think the question is should Citizens United have allowed [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2750.48s)]
*  This kind of spending and are we better off as a democracy? [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2755.1200000000003s)]
*  For it and I think what is your mouth thing? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2759.6000000000004s)]
*  The reason why I would be in favor of going back to the way it was [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2761.8s)]
*  is that I think the biggest problem is the redistricting and the gerrymandering that happens and [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2765.32s)]
*  The amount of influence that happens downstream [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2770.96s)]
*  inside of [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2774.12s)]
*  State and local elections and there are just places that are just so [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2775.64s)]
*  sclerotically stuck [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2780.9199999999996s)]
*  hmm, if you look at the federal despite all the spending you still see at the presidential level like pretty [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2782.64s)]
*  reasonable and healthy competition between two people [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2790.8399999999997s)]
*  It's much more difficult to see dynamism lower and lower down ballot [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2795.16s)]
*  And so the reason to get rid of Citizens United from my perspective is that you'd have much more vibrant [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2799.8s)]
*  local state [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2806.8s)]
*  Mayoral elections those things have huge impacts. I think to quality [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2808.44s)]
*  Okay, so you and I are in that camp chosen the other free Berg your thoughts. You're the deciding vote here [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2812.16s)]
*  It's two to one in terms of the panel [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2817.6s)]
*  It's like you just said to me you you just said to me you think we should go back [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2820.44s)]
*  This is the way it was it's a print courts on my side. So you guys are in trouble. Yeah [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2824.24s)]
*  The point of this program sometimes is not just to is to take ownership of your opinion and defend it [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2829.16s)]
*  So I never have I want to see people own it here in the discourse or free bird [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2834.64s)]
*  You can say pass but you don't get nothing. Okay. What does it mean? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2839.3199999999997s)]
*  to spend money on [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2844.08s)]
*  a political point of view [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2846.8399999999997s)]
*  Exactly [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2848.88s)]
*  What does it mean? It means you can put a book. I mean the other side wanted sensor books [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2849.92s)]
*  That's the thing like like if I want to if I want to pay someone to make a book for me [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2854.44s)]
*  If I want to pay someone if I want to pay 50 people [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2858.84s)]
*  To go and engage the community so I can get some leverage on my time [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2862.36s)]
*  If I want to pay someone to make a website to promote my point of view on something [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2866.84s)]
*  I should be able to do that and if my point of view is [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2870.76s)]
*  Related to a vote that Congress might be taking or is related to a candidate that's running for election [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2874.8s)]
*  Or is related to taxes or is related to some other social issue [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2882.2s)]
*  I don't know how you can kind of very clearly delineate the difference between [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2886.68s)]
*  some kind of political party or some political candidate [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2891.92s)]
*  versus my having a point of view on an issue if I care very deeply about animal welfare [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2896.48s)]
*  Which I do and if I had enough money that I felt like I could spend that money to influence people's point of view [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2901.16s)]
*  To improve animal welfare through laws and through candidates [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2907.08s)]
*  I would spend that money and I should have a right to do so and I shouldn't feel restricted that I can't go publicly [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2911.08s)]
*  Express my voice make websites put up billboards put up posters buy ads and papers telling people how wrong it is [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2917.24s)]
*  The way we treat animals and slaughter them and keep them living for their very short lives in [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2924.4s)]
*  Terrorist conditions I want to be able to express that point of view and so I kind of veer to this idea [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2929.0800000000004s)]
*  I like your question. Do would you do you think that your money spending if the balance of power to get your view was to [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2934.46s)]
*  Redistrict certain [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2942.7200000000003s)]
*  Places so that then you could get a majority of people that were ideologically aligned to you elected [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2945.44s)]
*  Would you do that as well forget? There's no ads running. This is about a different form of electoral influence [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2950.52s)]
*  Would you do that? So not spending money you're saying like I'm not spending money to you'd spend money, but it's not for ads [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2956.44s)]
*  It's not how does that work? How do you spend money to redistrict? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2960.84s)]
*  You get certain people elected by trucking people out to vote and then you get that person to join a coalition that then [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2963.92s)]
*  Redistricts, I mean maybe trucking people out to vote as an action should be illegal. That seems pretty reasonable to me [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2971.52s)]
*  Well, yeah [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2976.56s)]
*  I mean to your point free bird you asked like how do you define it? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2976.84s)]
*  What I'm trying to point out to you is for every dollar that goes into politics [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2979.8s)]
*  I think it's I would ask you guys to just [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2983.12s)]
*  Suspend belief that a hundred percent of that goes to adsmen or what I'm trying to say [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2987.12s)]
*  Yeah, I hear you [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2991.2s)]
*  I would say a very small [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2991.76s)]
*  Not a very small ten ten ten to twenty cents goes to ads eighty percent goes to all kinds of shady stuff [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2993.16s)]
*  And this also can by the way you call it shady, but I would argue like what if I want to make a bunch of websites [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=2998.44s)]
*  What if I want to make like, you know have people go out and express the point of view in the town square [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3003.64s)]
*  You know, like there are other aspects of what you might what I'm saying is that's fine [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3008.6s)]
*  That's in the ten cent bucket the 80 cents what I'm trying to tell you explicitly is how it's spent today is [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3012.0s)]
*  Not in the ways that you think I think that the fact that someone calls it shady might be because they disagree with my point [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3016.92s)]
*  Of view and it's my point of view. They might I think I think the tactics today [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3022.28s)]
*  Look, I play with the conditions on the field [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3026.92s)]
*  But if you look at them meaning like using dollar incentives to incentivize people that's allowed today. You can pay people to vote today [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3028.84s)]
*  Before we had you can pay them to join a super PAC or something like that [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3037.3199999999997s)]
*  But let hold on let me let me just get Joe involved here. So Joe you heard freeberg's you're kind of in alignment [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3040.72s)]
*  I think broadly [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3045.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3046.64s)]
*  But we can define some very specific things that are obviously political like the window of when you spend the money [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3046.8399999999997s)]
*  Like why telling people well because you could say in the six [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3054.08s)]
*  Specific vote I get it. I get it. If you're not if you're targeting an issue, that's one thing [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3060.2s)]
*  But when you tell people she's for they then he's for you, that's clearly a political ad now [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3064.2s)]
*  You could take those ads you could take canvassing you could define a subset of behaviors [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3069.52s)]
*  And you could say you can raise up to this amount of money per person in that way [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3074.68s)]
*  That's me those things are explicitly political when you tell people this is about candidate a [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3079.12s)]
*  Versus candidate page if you were to say this we're not gonna mention any candidates [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3084.8799999999997s)]
*  We're gonna talk about your puppies and you trying to increase your QC score here on the goddamn pod by saving puppies [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3088.82s)]
*  Don't be like animal welfare is a fucked up issue [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3094.78s)]
*  Agreement I just don't like how many points you're scoring with the audience over did you guys see this thing on Instagram? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3098.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna save my puppies from my ranch [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3103.1000000000004s)]
*  Somebody save some cows. Did you guys see this Instagram real? My wife showed it to me. It's like of a of a calf [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3106.86s)]
*  chasing a dog and [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3113.52s)]
*  It cuts to this Asian guy and he's like, what's the big deal here? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3115.52s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3119.16s)]
*  Like, you know, you want us to not eat everything blah blah blah [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3120.04s)]
*  And then he realizes that they're talking about the dog versus the cat don't trigger free bird [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3122.68s)]
*  Don't laugh I got 33 acres paradise I'm gonna save every animal in in Central Texas [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3131.4s)]
*  I'm gonna eat them and I and I would give you money to do that [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3136.6s)]
*  Actually, I actually I agree with what Jamal was saying about gerrymandering [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3141.56s)]
*  I think we could use AI for that's a separate conversation. It's discussing how it works right now [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3145.44s)]
*  However, Jason the problem at the end of the day with defining what's political or not [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3149.12s)]
*  Is the boundary cases are really tough and you do end up needing effectively effectively a censorship board [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3152.96s)]
*  examples I write I write a book about the dangers of communism and it's [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3158.2400000000002s)]
*  Explains how it's linked to things going on today and I like give it out it like yeah [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3163.36s)]
*  All these people are gonna be voting. I mean, there's just so many boundary cases [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3167.36s)]
*  But if we just spend up to 10 million a year doing political activity 10 million a year gives you a cap so you [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3170.0s)]
*  Look somebody's not my it's not political activity. It's my art. This is a this is an artistic piece of our clients [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3176.96s)]
*  But when you put the book in and say vote for Biden, then we would say, okay you put a vote for my [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3181.84s)]
*  Saying though it becomes it becomes really complicated. I just ran it through grok and what the answer was is that [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3187.52s)]
*  56% of all the spending [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3195.2s)]
*  Happens to be on ads and 44% of all dollars in 24 25 was spent on other [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3198.2s)]
*  Yeah, so there's a canvassing in there. I bet you it's 75% [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3203.64s)]
*  So if we just say for those two activities put a hard cap on them, I would be for that [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3207.72s)]
*  Like about core we've all right gentlemen, we can't talk about politics all day as exciting as it is [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3216.08s)]
*  Let's talk about this core weave IPO. If you don't know core weave is part of a new type of [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3221.6s)]
*  Infrastructure provider called Neo cloud. It's a fancy way of saying using GPUs to build data centers [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3228.2s)]
*  This is a really interesting company because they got on to GPUs early and they had a lock-in on a large number of Nvidia's [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3234.72s)]
*  GPUs they've got 32 data centers with 250,000 Nvidia GPUs as an example when [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3241.68s)]
*  Elon built the largest fastest data center [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3250.0s)]
*  Colossus that was a hundred thousand. So this is you know, really really a big company [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3254.2s)]
*  They're gonna do an IPO analysts are estimating. They're gonna raise at least 3.5 billion at over 30 billion dollars [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3259.46s)]
*  Their secondary was 23 billion in November of 2024. So this is cooking with oil [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3266.2s)]
*  They've got incredible revenue, by the way, 1.9 billion in 2024 [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3272.44s)]
*  but if you look at two years ago how much revenue they have the growth is amazing Nick put a chart in here and post because [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3276.56s)]
*  It's like a 10x I think each year or something crazy like that when I talked about it on the other pod [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3282.92s)]
*  But they're very unprofitable almost a billion dollars in loss in [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3288.2400000000002s)]
*  2024 and that's interest payments on a lot of their debt [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3292.84s)]
*  They have almost 8 billion in debt huge debt load to buy all these GPUs and that has been the question [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3295.96s)]
*  We've been talking about here Chamath is are these GPUs are these Neo clouds fancy way of saying [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3301.8s)]
*  I'll give you a couple of factoids about core which I find super impressive. So the first question is like you would say why didn't [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3308.48s)]
*  AWS [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3315.4s)]
*  GCP and Azure eat these guys for breakfast lunch and dinner and as it turns out they had one [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3316.88s)]
*  Very specific technical decision that I think was extremely valuable, which is that these guys did not use hypervisors explain what that is [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3324.92s)]
*  So a hypervisor is basically a middleware layer of software that allows you to abstract [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3331.6s)]
*  Units of compute so that then you can make them available and [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3336.56s)]
*  Instead they basically allowed you to write to the bare metal and this very native approach that allowed them to get a lot of traction [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3339.92s)]
*  So it's a really interesting thing to note that just that simple thing like one simple technical design decision [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3346.36s)]
*  Can allow you to build what looks like at least from the revenue perspective an incredible business, right? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3354.0s)]
*  So kudos to them super awesome to see that you can still maneuver around the big giants. I think that that's cool. I [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3360.48s)]
*  Think the big question with core weave is what is the period of amortization and the useful life of these GPUs from Nvidia? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3366.32s)]
*  And I think that that question is up in the air. As you said Jason a lot of their losses are these interest payments [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3374.32s)]
*  and [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3380.0s)]
*  As long as that they have that [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3381.68s)]
*  Calculated right in their models that they used to borrow all this money to buy all these [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3383.7599999999998s)]
*  GPUs from Nvidia. This is going to be a killer business [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3389.2799999999997s)]
*  To the extent that they got that calculation wrong meaning we thought the useful life was 10 years [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3392.96s)]
*  But it turned out to be five. This business is deeply underwater [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3398.2799999999997s)]
*  So I think that that's the bet the bet is they've built an amount of headway [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3401.2799999999997s)]
*  They're going to continue to do this [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3407.56s)]
*  Good technical engineering [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3409.72s)]
*  But the other side of it is is the useful life right is the technology curve right is Moore's law and all these other things [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3412.72s)]
*  Will they work in its favor or against it? And I think that's the people say useful lifespan [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3418.72s)]
*  GPUs three to five years before [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3424.4s)]
*  The next generation is so much more powerful [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3427.68s)]
*  Especially in relation to power consumption that it's worth running it now with servers over and over again [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3430.2799999999997s)]
*  That it's worth running it now with servers old CPUs for running Facebook [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3436.56s)]
*  It's a totally different story [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3441.92s)]
*  You can keep those running five to seven years before it's not worth running and you have to turn them off [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3442.84s)]
*  What do you think here? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3447.44s)]
*  You're right. There's an economic question on the power and all these things actually know Brandon [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3448.64s)]
*  He lives nearby me in my house in Montana [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3452.0s)]
*  He's a really smart guy and I think the really interesting thing, you know when they built this [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3454.1600000000003s)]
*  I think it's relevant going forward is these guys were commodities traders and they were originally [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3457.2400000000002s)]
*  Buying stuff to like mine Bitcoin other stuff like that and they realized as commodities traders [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3461.2000000000003s)]
*  There's like a certain supply and demand in the market of GPU chips [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3466.48s)]
*  But also of all the data centers by the way [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3469.44s)]
*  And it's a really it's really interesting what they did is they locked down the full supply of tons of data centers tons of the power [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3471.32s)]
*  They needed tons of the chips and they're very very thoughtful [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3477.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, they're effectively their traders and they're and they're very economic and they have I think they have a lot of the stuff [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3480.36s)]
*  Well that explains the technical decision because they have to have very low latency [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3485.32s)]
*  Throughput in order to transact efficiently as commodities traders. I'm guessing there is one exactly please heal [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3489.96s)]
*  That's clear for this company Friedberg. They had massive revenue growth, but they have a dependency [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3495.24s)]
*  60% of revenue now from Microsoft and Microsoft seems to have done this either [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3501.48s)]
*  It's unclear but maybe to service the open at AI deal where they needed to give them a bunch of infrastructure or it might be for [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3506.44s)]
*  Azure it's unclear people have been asking this question for a couple of years now [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3513.48s)]
*  But what do you think of a business with one client with 60% [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3517.56s)]
*  Dependent and this is how these things work Jason is they just one client tends to grow really really fast and they're actually [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3521.52s)]
*  You know, so they do this orchestration framework called sunk. I know a little bit about it [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3526.72s)]
*  It's a really easy for scheduling workflows and batches and all these things [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3530.64s)]
*  I think a lot of other people are using really well [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3533.84s)]
*  They just bought weights and biases right which like everyone is basically. Yeah, it's a great buy [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3535.84s)]
*  They're killer for training [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3541.56s)]
*  I mean, I think these guys crush in training Satya Nadelle said that Microsoft was doing this maybe not for a long-term usage [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3542.92s)]
*  So free bring your thoughts on core weave [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3549.96s)]
*  I'm not as deep as you guys are I remember in [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3552.88s)]
*  2003 I worked for nine months at a private equity firm and I would cold call [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3556.92s)]
*  Like companies that hadn't raised venture capital that were profitable and fast growing and see if they would take our money [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3562.0s)]
*  That's the business model and I spent a lot of time in the sector of businesses that were called speed doublers [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3568.06s)]
*  I don't know if you guys remember these companies 2003 was before we all had broadband internet [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3574.58s)]
*  So we were a lot of people were using dial-up and you could pay 9.99 a month for a speed doubler [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3579.46s)]
*  And what it would do is it would basically on your browser [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3584.14s)]
*  Set the server to be their server and they had a cache of many of the popular sites on the internet [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3587.5s)]
*  So when you started browsing the internet on your computer everything loaded faster [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3593.2200000000003s)]
*  Because they had really fast servers and you got these caches and these companies do they were doing like tens of millions of revenue [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3597.44s)]
*  high margin 50% plus EBITDA margin and [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3604.0s)]
*  growing like a hundred percent plus a year and [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3607.3999999999996s)]
*  I remember we we spent a bunch of time looking at these companies [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3609.96s)]
*  This is right before I joined Google and I was like this feels like a transitory business [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3612.72s)]
*  it's like an arbitrage between where we were and where we're going and [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3617.8799999999997s)]
*  That's what ended up happening [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3622.44s)]
*  Many of them just cash flowed out the founders took money or they were able to get a really smart private equity recap done [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3623.8s)]
*  Get some money out and run at some low multiple of EBITDA or something [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3628.48s)]
*  And so I worry a little bit about a business like this [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3632.0800000000004s)]
*  Where there's four or five companies that are each doing 80 billion dollars of CapEx this year [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3635.6000000000004s)]
*  To create infrastructure that effectively starts to replace what these guys are effectively offering out as a service [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3642.1200000000003s)]
*  That would be my biggest kind if I was to do diligence on this business [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3647.7200000000003s)]
*  That's where I would spend a lot of my time is like guys [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3651.16s)]
*  What's the capacity gonna be in a year or two sort of like when broadband hit the internet? [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3653.88s)]
*  You didn't need speed doublers anymore. Do you really need to be paying as much as you are today? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3657.38s)]
*  Is there gonna be as much demand? How much is this gonna get bundled in with GCP or AWS and so on in the future? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3661.3199999999997s)]
*  So that would be my kind of macro hesitation and caution on the diligence as I ran my diligence on this thing [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3666.88s)]
*  You basically need an economist to map this all out. It's the same question for data centers in a related way, right? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3672.96s)]
*  Which you just need to map everything and I don't have those date those numbers. So you're right. It's a hard thing to figure out [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3677.7599999999998s)]
*  That's right. Well, the founders have control of the company and they sold [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3682.3999999999996s)]
*  A lot maybe it's 150 each but they've kept most of their position. They're smart guys. So yeah, they still own the majority [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3687.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't know. I don't want to speak negatively about the business and I haven't spent much time on it [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3695.24s)]
*  But I mean, I think that's the worst that could happen if you speak negatively about somebody's business [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3698.7999999999997s)]
*  I [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3707.72s)]
*  Like to be on somebody's list for a decade [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3710.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't know. I mean the ratings keep going up for this week and startups and all in so I'll take a shout out [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3712.8799999999997s)]
*  Are you purposefully starting to dress up J Cal by the way, because I notice every week now you're wearing [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3718.64s)]
*  A jacket speak and speaking gig, but my friends at Eton [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3723.9599999999996s)]
*  Reached out to me. So I might be trying to do a little great right now [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3728.8799999999997s)]
*  Are you plugging right now or a piano hasn't reached out but Eton shirts, which I'm wearing right now [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3732.3599999999997s)]
*  Eton, you know [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3737.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no I got but I'm also saying Tom Ford's people reached out and said, you know that lapel thing [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3741.88s)]
*  You can take that off if you want. We'll have somebody come over [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3746.44s)]
*  So I just want to shout out my friends over there have no commercial deal [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3748.8s)]
*  ketone K ITON jackets, I've been wearing K [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3752.2400000000002s)]
*  Very nice. I like to check them out on earth. I wear them all the time. I love those jackets just saying let's move on [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3756.08s)]
*  Yes, and Joe Lonsdale's I was recently by the Uyghurs the Uyghurs in China he gets them specifically made for $17 [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3762.24s)]
*  I was recently I was recently sponsored by a company. It's cut. This is incredible [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3769.48s)]
*  They they meet you at the FBO and they take your watch and they they set the new time for you [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3777.8799999999997s)]
*  So especially if it's a mechanical watch is a very complicated. Oh, yes, this is very important, right? [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3783.72s)]
*  I got you know what? I was [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3787.8799999999997s)]
*  Had my watch collection and they did this for me when I was flying [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3792.64s)]
*  Five billion telling you how to look at the world we should get rid of income tax [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3801.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm sure everybody listings like hmm really convenient no income tax for the billionaires and sent to millionaires. Good job guys [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3805.44s)]
*  All right. Let's keep going down the [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3811.7999999999997s)]
*  All right, you know, we've been going back and forth in the group chat and you've been talking about it publicly maybe Main Street [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3815.48s)]
*  versus Wall Street and [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3822.04s)]
*  What's going on in the markets here because there's EU? [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3823.96s)]
*  Bond issues we obviously it seems like in some ways [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3827.3999999999996s)]
*  Maybe the Trump campaign is not thinking about the stock market as much as they're thinking about the bond market [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3831.16s)]
*  Explain to us your take on markets right now [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3837.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think that there's three markets that are important. There's the US long end of the curve [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3840.8399999999997s)]
*  So this is the 10-year bond yield. I think then there's the US equity market and then [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3846.2s)]
*  The most next important market are the European [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3852.24s)]
*  Bond and equity markets together and I'll explain why in a second, but just on the first few I mentioned this before but I [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3856.24s)]
*  Really do think we're in a secular shift [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3863.24s)]
*  where I [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3866.12s)]
*  think the MAGA majority and [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3867.7599999999998s)]
*  the base of people that can be a reliable voting block in the future as I've said before are [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3870.3999999999996s)]
*  Working in middle-class folks that don't necessarily own a ton of stocks nor do they own homes of which there's a lot [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3877.7200000000003s)]
*  Second cohort are people that are pro innovation and protect and the third are patriotic business owners [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3885.88s)]
*  I think that cohort is very large and I think that [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3893.0800000000004s)]
*  when [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3898.2000000000003s)]
*  The core strategist inside of MAGA figure this out one of the big takeaways is [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3900.0800000000004s)]
*  That they're not going to care about the stock market in Wall Street and [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3905.56s)]
*  a lot of the policies will be viewed through the lens of Main Street and I think that you started to see [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3909.88s)]
*  This rhetoric now [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3917.0s)]
*  One from Besant and we'll play this clip in a second and the second was just today from Trump himself [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3918.84s)]
*  But Nick, do you want to play the best and clip if you have it? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3924.4s)]
*  I think over the the medium term, which is what we're focused on [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3926.52s)]
*  It's a focus on Main Street Wall Street's done great Wall Street can continue to do fine [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3930.8s)]
*  But we have a focus on small business and the consumers so we are going to rebalance the economy [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3937.32s)]
*  We're gonna bring manufacturing jobs home. That was the first one. The second one was just today Nick [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3944.84s)]
*  I sent it to you [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3950.1600000000003s)]
*  Do you want to just show it to these guys which I think is really interesting? [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3950.8s)]
*  So it says here breaking news from I guess unusual wells Trump has just said he's not looking at the stock market [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3953.28s)]
*  Okay, so not sure I believe that but okay, so why is this actually valuable? Well if [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3959.36s)]
*  We are incentivized if the government of America is incentivized to implement policies that crack the equity markets [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3965.88s)]
*  It's actually really good in some ways. Number one is if you deflate asset prices, you also deflate inflation [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3973.8s)]
*  Okay, and you have an example there for the audience. So we make it clear Nvidia is ripping at all-time highs [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3982.44s)]
*  You are like, oh wow, I'm so cash rich. You can go get a margin loan [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3988.62s)]
*  You take that money you reinvest it in a second home and a third home [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3992.82s)]
*  You sell some stock you start to buy cars all this other stuff [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3996.62s)]
*  it drives consumptive behavior that on the margin isn't there if [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=3999.84s)]
*  The markets were much much lower than this. So if you rebase the equity [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4004.46s)]
*  values that people have [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4010.46s)]
*  What you do is you actually depress the amount of free cash flow that they have to spend on other things [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4012.22s)]
*  So it's a deflationary tactic how the bond market reacts to that is if the stock market goes down is you start to become [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4018.02s)]
*  A flight to quality right? Oh my gosh, there's volatility in the stock market. Oh my gosh [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4025.78s)]
*  I don't want to deal with the stock market going down [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4030.42s)]
*  Let me just sell take some chips off the table and buy 10-year bonds when you buy the bonds the interest rate goes down [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4032.58s)]
*  Why is that good for America? We have ten trillion dollars [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4039.5s)]
*  We need to go out and borrow in the next nine months and so if we can pay 3% 3.8% 4% [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4042.68s)]
*  We save us ourselves trillions of dollars versus if we had to pay four and a half five five and a half percent [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4050.48s)]
*  so that's the second thing and [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4056.12s)]
*  Then the third thing is that right now what we had this week because of the Ukraine and Zelensky thing is basically Trump [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4059.52s)]
*  Say we are totally risk off this war [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4066.44s)]
*  And I'm not going to debate whether that's right or wrong, but that's what he said [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4069.2s)]
*  We're gonna curtail the aid. We're not even gonna share intelligence [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4072.8799999999997s)]
*  They're on their own. What did that force? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4077.18s)]
*  What happened this week was the Europeans had to basically circle the wagons and they said okay [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4080.48s)]
*  We're gonna step up and what they announced was a four-year plan [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4085.94s)]
*  To borrow money to invest in defense [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4090.74s)]
*  What they also did which was really interesting is the UK specifically said we're gonna borrow it in this clever little way [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4094.2799999999997s)]
*  This is their interpretation so that it doesn't actually count in the debt to GDP calculations of my country [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4101.1s)]
*  So they're starting they're starting to eat [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4106.9800000000005s)]
*  But then so then how did the bond market react to it Nick? You can show it they're like, you know what guys if you want to [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4109.3s)]
*  fight this war [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4114.88s)]
*  Obviously you're allowed to do whatever you want [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4116.46s)]
*  But the cost that you're gonna have to pay is gonna go up. This has been going up every day and [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4118.02s)]
*  You're at a point now where this is severe [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4125.18s)]
*  Fiscal pressure on [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4129.14s)]
*  These governments. I do not know how they sustain their deficits and raise more debt [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4131.58s)]
*  So all of this is happening all at the same time. I think Trump is pro-mainstreet [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4137.26s)]
*  Equity markets basically do not get bid the bond markets respond positively yields go down good for America [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4142.22s)]
*  They extract themselves from spending programs like [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4149.66s)]
*  Again it's more than a spending program [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4154.42s)]
*  But I'll just say it in this context narrowly Russia Ukraine is a spending program that that if you take off the table [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4156.34s)]
*  That balance of responsibility goes to Europe and then the markets are saying this is not right [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4162.18s)]
*  We want this war to end and we're gonna make it more expensive for you to litigate it if you put it all together [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4167.8s)]
*  It's a really interesting moment in the markets. I haven't seen in a very long time Joe you think [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4172.82s)]
*  This is the [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4178.22s)]
*  Financing of our debt is the endgame here [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4180.34s)]
*  There's like maybe 10% of people who seem to have fallen in that camp when I queried on these four group chats [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4183.16s)]
*  Hey, you know if we can depress everything we lower consumption. We break inflation even more [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4189.64s)]
*  Maybe people lose their jobs, you know less consumption [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4194.62s)]
*  And rates go down. We have to cut rates three or four times put pressure on the Fed then we can [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4198.900000000001s)]
*  maybe [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4205.5s)]
*  Refinance our debt which is coming up some percentage of it. What do you think of that theory? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4207.06s)]
*  You know Jason Jamaat has a lot of interesting thoughts here, and I think it's I think it's a very smart analysis [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4210.860000000001s)]
*  I'm not fully aligned. It is true bond markets hate war war is expensive or is inflationary. It's very clear [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4215.46s)]
*  Europe is going through okay, you know, it bores more likely for us to spend money that and that hurts them [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4221.84s)]
*  You know in the US [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4226.3s)]
*  I think the number one thing that Scott Besson and Trump would want around this is [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4227.38s)]
*  Is to fight for Main Street like they said but that really is, you know [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4231.54s)]
*  Kind of populist energy we have right now and so I think they are focused on lower interest rates lower interest rates [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4234.7s)]
*  You know, I have some someone who works with me their spouse [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4239.26s)]
*  You know as a real estate agent and that they're having a really tough couple years because industry spiked up if you're gonna trace down again [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4241.9s)]
*  There's so many different places in America where people start making money again with with the title companies with [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4246.82s)]
*  Brokers with there's so many things that happen right with that and show down. Yes. It's well, it's not just trickle down [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4251.74s)]
*  It's like this is the part of the economy that that just really does start to turn on and certain transactions can happen again [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4256.98s)]
*  And you're right it is cheaper debt that is that there's advantage as well [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4262.46s)]
*  So I think disinflation is very important and I think we have to find some way to get there [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4265.38s)]
*  Chamath may be right that it's worth hitting assets to get to this inflation [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4269.14s)]
*  That's something that Scott could be working on because of all the debt but it is it is true. It's the easiest [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4272.22s)]
*  It's the easy it's the easiest and we do and we do need it for sure [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4276.46s)]
*  So and I hopefully I think there's some other more clever ways to get there [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4280.3s)]
*  But but I do like that. I mean you said there's some more clever ways to get there [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4283.38s)]
*  Obviously, we don't want to see eight nine ten percent unemployment [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4286.9800000000005s)]
*  That's another way to get there and we don't want that because you know, Main Street equals jobs. Oh [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4290.26s)]
*  What do you what is your other ways to get there? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4296.5s)]
*  Well, the other ways to get there is there's two there's really two right now in our society [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4299.06s)]
*  They're very positive. One of them is a higher productivity through AI [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4302.76s)]
*  I'm working on a ton of things as our sure everyone else doing that like we're doing construction for much cheaper right now [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4306.66s)]
*  We're making that though right government can't be involved in that that's up to us. We can make sure not describing David's doing good work [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4311.42s)]
*  We can make sure not to screw it up. There's a lot of people trying to screw up in government [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4316.820000000001s)]
*  So I think David's job is very important there to get it. It's not here, please [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4319.46s)]
*  And then the and then the second thing is actually [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4323.3s)]
*  Cutting spend like just giving out hundreds of billions [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4326.66s)]
*  Willy-nilly to Stacey Abrams at all is very inflationary and so so I think I think cutting spend it actually is a very positive [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4329.18s)]
*  Thing we could do a lot more of that free bird. You heard the two gentlemen [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4335.86s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the refinancing of interest as I've done before? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4339.3s)]
*  I'm gonna give you incredible leadership credit for three years ago on this pod pushing all of us to really think about what would [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4344.38s)]
*  Happen if the debt increased another eight trillion, which it did [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4350.9800000000005s)]
*  And I think that influenced a lot of people in our circles and obviously that's something that the president took on [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4354.820000000001s)]
*  When none of us thought he would any president would ever take on that issue. How much pain [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4361.900000000001s)]
*  Do you think Trump is willing to take with the stock market going down in order? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4367.66s)]
*  Refines the debt the debt is he willing to be incredibly unpopular? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4371.54s)]
*  Is he willing to deal with the criticism from Wall Street and from equity holders over some sustained period? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4375.14s)]
*  And how much would he be if it goes down the market goes down 10 20% [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4382.58s)]
*  Do you think he's gonna cry uncle or you think he's willing to take that kind of pain free bird? [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4385.98s)]
*  Like I said, I don't know about Trump. There's a you know, I would say 60 40. I'd be right 40% [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4390.3s)]
*  I'd be wrong. So I don't know most people are here for that [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4395.66s)]
*  That's actually a pretty good ratio in poker if you can win that many hands. Yeah, I mean I'd say 60% [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4398.3s)]
*  He's probably different than Trump 1.0 and he's probably less [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4402.62s)]
*  Influenced by the short-term rumblings about the market. Okay, and he's probably listening to Besant on this one. Although [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4407.900000000001s)]
*  You know, I think it's it's got to be a complicated relationship between the two of them at the moment [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4418.1s)]
*  I do think that he is aware and I would imagine the administration generally with Besant and others in in [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4423.14s)]
*  Kind of key leadership positions are trying to make the case that if we can get rates down [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4430.06s)]
*  We have an opportunity to kind of refinance this ten trillion dollars that's coming due in the next twelve months and [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4438.34s)]
*  Get ourselves into a kind of more sustainable [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4444.9800000000005s)]
*  Financing position there's still the fiscal position [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4447.780000000001s)]
*  Which is how are we spending money and how are we spending money over time that needs to be addressed? [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4450.78s)]
*  This is this is a central question. You're totally right. Let's address that specifically with Ukraine [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4455.219999999999s)]
*  you're a bit of a hawk an American exceptionalist Joe and [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4461.179999999999s)]
*  We are looking at a situation where we spent [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4468.099999999999s)]
*  175 billion there were some other numbers that Trump was floating around that were incorrect and [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4472.46s)]
*  They got fact-checked [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4476.5s)]
*  175 billion is what we're actually in for according to all accounts [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4477.7s)]
*  This was done as I said many times on this very program and got laughed at and joked about done on a lease loan [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4480.86s)]
*  Trump because these things were done on a lease loan now has the upper hand with Zelensky [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4489.18s)]
*  And he's a great negotiator and he said we want 500 billion back [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4494.14s)]
*  Don't need to make this about dollars and cents here because obviously this is life and death and people's [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4498.38s)]
*  Democracy we're talking about their sovereignty [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4503.9800000000005s)]
*  But that 175 billion if he gets that 500 billion back, that's a 42% IRR in three years on this [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4506.62s)]
*  Even if we just got our money back that would be fine for the American people [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4514.22s)]
*  how do you look at the war in Ukraine both financially and in terms of containing Putin and [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4517.02s)]
*  Finally in terms of our participation in NATO is a time for us to leave NATO Joe Lonsdale. Wow [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4523.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, you know Jason Putin's a bad guy [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4529.66s)]
*  That's number one, he's shouldn't have been thank you for saying that it's refreshing to hear it on this podcast [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4531.7s)]
*  You know, I do think the last administration mismanaged it [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4536.58s)]
*  I don't think he would have invaded with Trump as president [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4539.62s)]
*  He certainly would have invaded with competent person threading him [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4541.34s)]
*  So but you know, but now we have to have peace and I do want peace [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4544.34s)]
*  I don't want to have the war continuing but to get peace you got to get both sides to come to the table [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4547.099999999999s)]
*  I prefer peace through strength [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4551.34s)]
*  I prefer being really strong on Putin and showing why he has to have peace [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4552.98s)]
*  But then you need Zelensky to be a partner for it, too [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4555.82s)]
*  And I do think listen, I do think it's less important to have a strong partner [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4557.94s)]
*  Listen, I do think Zelensky had the wrong idea on the White House last week. He should have been thanking them [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4560.9s)]
*  He should have come more humbly. He should have actually been directed towards really wanting a piece [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4565.7s)]
*  I mean, listen, I I agree that Ukraine's a very corrupt country. We may find out that he and his cronies have been taking a bunch of money [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4569.58s)]
*  I don't know if they are not either way [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4575.58s)]
*  He has not really been signaling the right way to be open to peace and a piece that does I think have to give up a little bit of Ukraine in order to get there I think that's the option on the table right now and that's the direction I want to [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4577.42s)]
*  The NATO question, what's the, you know, and thank you for being so candid here [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4586.98s)]
*  What's the NATO outcome here? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4590.139999999999s)]
*  Is it time for maybe Europe to just go it alone because they don't seem to like what happened last Friday at the White House [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4594.379999999999s)]
*  They, yeah, and maybe do you think it's time maybe that we we bow out and let them arm up? [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4601.9s)]
*  This is really tough for me because some of the people I care about most in the world live in places like Germany and around there and I want them to be safe [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4607.58s)]
*  I also think that the historic relationship between the UK and the US is this very, very valuable thing that we have [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4614.62s)]
*  They shouldn't just be tossed aside. These are these are critical, very longtime allies and cousins [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4620.22s)]
*  You know, I think Europe's in a very, very bad place. It's very dysfunctional, man [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4625.42s)]
*  It's it's I did not see European civilization going the right way the next 20 or 30 years [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4628.94s)]
*  I think JD's right to criticize them on on anti free speech [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4633.22s)]
*  I'm like, you know, arresting people who criticize the Islamic threat like more than the people actually doing the rapes and stuff [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4636.38s)]
*  It's crazy. These places have lost their minds, you know [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4641.9s)]
*  It's bonkers. So do I want to to totally give it up? No [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4644.42s)]
*  But do I want to demand fiercely that the certain things get fixed and to use our foreign policy apparatus? [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4647.900000000001s)]
*  To make sure we fix those things if we're gonna stay in the relationship hundred percent [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4653.86s)]
*  What do you think Chema this NATO question seems like Europe is kind of signaling that they're willing to go it alone [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4657.54s)]
*  And should the United States just say okay go for it [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4663.74s)]
*  We're out because that's literally what sacks retweeted recently just said hey, we're out is your problem [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4667.66s)]
*  And I think the administration's given him free rein to discuss the topic he talked discussed it here for many years [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4673.3s)]
*  What are your thoughts should we be out on NATO? Well, I think the question is when do these transnational [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4678.580000000001s)]
*  organizations outlive their utility [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4685.22s)]
*  That's the question on the table and it's not just a question for NATO [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4687.820000000001s)]
*  But it's a question for a bunch of these other things the WHO [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4691.700000000001s)]
*  NATO the United Nations there's many of these organizations [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4695.780000000001s)]
*  What you've seen is that there are [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4700.58s)]
*  Competitive organizations now that are just as important if not more [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4705.5s)]
*  So if you didn't like OPEC well, then there is this OPEC plus plus thing if you didn't like [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4709.42s)]
*  how the [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4716.46s)]
*  Europeans and the Americans did intelligence gathering then all of a sudden five eyes came out of nowhere if you didn't like the [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4717.98s)]
*  G7 there's the bricks, right? So [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4725.179999999999s)]
*  There is this tendency for the world to create these startups to try to challenge incumbency as [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4728.1s)]
*  the conditions on the ground change I [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4735.7s)]
*  Think the most important thing right now the Europeans need to do is acknowledge this one critical fact [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4738.58s)]
*  The individual governments of Europe are vibrant and powerful [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4744.1s)]
*  The European Union itself was created almost without any real teeth [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4748.5s)]
*  And so what happened is the folks there started to pass inordinate numbers of laws [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4754.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, and that has made it really complicated to be a European company a European citizen and that has to get sorted out [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4758.74s)]
*  What is the real decision there? Is it about being Italian? Is it about being European? [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4765.62s)]
*  What is the separation and I don't think that that's clear and I think once they figure that out all this other stuff is much [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4770.7s)]
*  Easier to figure out. Well, you also have yeah other organizations Interpol, right? We have that you have the UN [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4776.7s)]
*  I mean it is maybe time to just [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4783.3s)]
*  Rewrote each of them free, but what do you think? I think that there is a viable case [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4786.3s)]
*  For a peaceful transition to kind of a multipolar [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4792.42s)]
*  Power dynamic and [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4799.820000000001s)]
*  If you're a techno pessimist [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4802.860000000001s)]
*  You're gonna have a point of view that there are more limited resources available to humans on earth and therefore we have to have influence [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4807.1s)]
*  to access those resources if you're a techno optimist [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4814.54s)]
*  You will believe that through AI and automation and all these other technologies that we could spend quite a bit of time around [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4818.9800000000005s)]
*  That we are going to have abundant housing [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4827.02s)]
*  abundant fuel [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4830.620000000001s)]
*  Abundant materials and generally an abundance of everything that one particular group might demand or need [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4832.3s)]
*  And you don't need to go be an empire to access the resources [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4839.58s)]
*  that your people are demanding and what I mean is the [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4844.62s)]
*  Mining industry is a good example. There is this discovery which I think we put on the docket for the science corner today of [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4848.58s)]
*  A giant thorium reserve in Inner Mongolia, which can be used to make a thorium molten salt reactor [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4854.74s)]
*  There's enough thorium in this reserve in China to [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4860.1s)]
*  produce enough energy for sixty thousand years of consumption based on current consumption rates I [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4863.46s)]
*  Saw a fantastic presentation this week by a startup that's using AI and other sensing technologies [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4869.9800000000005s)]
*  To identify new rare earth deposits in the crust of the earth that we have absolutely no visibility into today [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4878.34s)]
*  And many of our assumptions about how much availability there is of certain rare earth [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4886.0199999999995s)]
*  Metals is wrong and that there actually may be many many many orders of magnitude more material available to us to mine and the technology [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4892.58s)]
*  For mining is getting better the technology for discovering these deposits is improving and so on so in that world where suddenly I can make [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4899.58s)]
*  All the food I want everyone can be fed. There's plenty of land. There's plenty of housing. There's plenty of water [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4905.54s)]
*  There's automation that and robots that are serving me and all this sort of amazing stuff that's coming this century [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4910.38s)]
*  Do I really need to be having a freaking conflict with Russia and China? [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4916.42s)]
*  Over access to some jungle or some plot of land on the other side of the planet [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4920.860000000001s)]
*  Or can I live sustainably on in my country and everyone's gonna be generally happy? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4926.14s)]
*  so I think that this idea that maybe the US exits NATO and the US dials down its level of [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4932.06s)]
*  Conflict and opposition to Russia and or China is a pretty reasonable and I would argue maybe even a techno optimistic point of view and [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4939.54s)]
*  you know we may find that in the next couple of years we start to really believe it and [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4947.66s)]
*  If we start to believe it all the things that we're fighting over today [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4952.5s)]
*  You don't really need to fight over anymore [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4956.26s)]
*  except for the [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4959.1s)]
*  expansionist intentions of individuals [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4961.1s)]
*  Which is a sociological phenomenon which may still continue [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4963.26s)]
*  But I'm not sure that you need to be investing as much resources as we have historically so I would argue [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4966.98s)]
*  Maybe NATO in a multipolar world of abundance isn't as necessary as it has been in the past century [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4972.82s)]
*  Which was a world that was limited in resources fighting for access and a growing global population [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4978.9s)]
*  Particularly in a developed world in the West that's made it a necessity to maintain US primacy and US policing of the world [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4984.379999999999s)]
*  And I know others might have a point of view that's a little bit different [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4991.379999999999s)]
*  I think this is I think actually what you're talking about is a Star Trek beautiful version of abundance in the world if [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=4994.38s)]
*  These rare earth minerals create unlimited energy and your energy independent you look at the world differently and Joe we certainly in America [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5001.54s)]
*  Look at the world differently as we're all Gen Xers here basically [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5008.820000000001s)]
*  We look at the world much differently now since we have energy independence than we did under Bush and these [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5012.780000000001s)]
*  Farm wars, you know in the Middle East. Yeah, I mean listen [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5019.5s)]
*  Yeah, and I'm one of the most optimistic people. I call myself the American optimist Jason, as you know [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5023.96s)]
*  I mean had saxon. Have you had saxon at least American people people are too busy to come on [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5035.32s)]
*  I'll try to get you all right for for what besties got it. Okay. All right, I gotta work on it [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5039.64s)]
*  Listen, I I would love AI to get to the point [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5043.68s)]
*  I think it will work starts to accelerate growth where this energy stuff can be mined more easily [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5046.4s)]
*  But until I'd say until we're at at least five six percent growth because we are going to the post-carsity world [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5050.36s)]
*  We don't know what it's coming. I do still think global trade really matters [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5055.28s)]
*  I do think global security for ourselves like we don't want random people with nuclear proliferation [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5058.86s)]
*  So there are issues that are going to affect all of us [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5063.48s)]
*  But I think Dave makes a really great point that it is becoming less important over time. It's true [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5065.839999999999s)]
*  Let's talk about this chat GPT. I guess they came out with 4.5. It was such a dud [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5070.86s)]
*  I didn't even realize that they launched it Chamath you monitored this or free bird. Did you try it because I've been using [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5075.36s)]
*  Grok as my default now then Gemini then chat GPT [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5082.2s)]
*  That's my order right now because I wanted to see how good grok is and man grok is [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5086.2s)]
*  It's really caught up and I don't have an interest here in you know, I don't have equity in any of these companies [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5090.5599999999995s)]

*  well, I use them in in the company building context and [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5106.16s)]
*  Specifically at 80 90 because of what we're building and what I would tell you is that I think entropic [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5110.719999999999s)]
*  Just continues to do an incredible job. I think Claude 3 7 [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5117.2s)]
*  It just kicks ass [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5123.5599999999995s)]
*  Hmm. Oh, you're you're on Claude for you're using on the back end [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5125.5599999999995s)]
*  We use it for a lot of automated code generation and its models on code generation [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5129.48s)]
*  I think are just exceptional if they're they are the best in market then what I would say is as a consumer [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5135.5599999999995s)]
*  I've mostly flipped my usage to grok 3 [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5141.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and the reason is that it's in line with where I consume most of my information. It's elegantly integrated [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5144.62s)]
*  Inside of X it's yeah to point this out to explain it people when you're in Twitter now X on the top right hand of a [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5152.44s)]
*  Tweet there's an X AI button when you click it. It just gives you the full context of the tweet [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5159.28s)]
*  So I was reading one of Dara's from uber's tweets about [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5163.679999999999s)]
*  Autonomy, I guess they added two more partners when I clicked it. It gave me more than I ever could want [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5168.24s)]
*  It was almost like a deep research of the context of a very short retweet [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5172.7s)]
*  He did and I didn't have to cut and paste and form a question. So owning a social network [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5175.98s)]
*  Equals instant and here we're gonna show it with Joe Lonsdale's where he says hey listen [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5182.32s)]
*  You know the the crypto tax fills like taxation to me and look it goes and finds four web pages you can see there [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5186.72s)]
*  it tells you which ones Wikipedia and [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5192.400000000001s)]
*  CNBC amongst them and then it gives Joe's position. This is like very [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5196.16s)]
*  Elegant there's a super elegant and I think there's a small tweak to this [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5201.12s)]
*  Okay [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5206.0s)]
*  That Elon and I were talking about actually on X which is then just the nature of being able to analyze a post for its [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5207.320000000001s)]
*  Veracity becomes really valuable that extra little thing when it's available [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5213.16s)]
*  I think will have a really big impact on how people use it in this context [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5216.92s)]
*  So I use crock for the consumer applications for all of our code generation. We're using sonnet 3 7. It's exceptional [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5221.599999999999s)]
*  Which is anthropics which is doing a major round of funding got it. Okay. Yeah, and and I think like the thing with [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5229.5599999999995s)]
*  The GPT-4 5 is that it's kind of like good now. Here's here's a tangent [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5235.84s)]
*  Let me just do a small little rant which is [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5240.86s)]
*  We're at the bleeding edge of where these benchmarks are useful [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5244.139999999999s)]
*  meaning part of why Jason maybe you weren't necessarily watching this as closely and I think where [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5248.299999999999s)]
*  The media and the sense-making organizations get confused is they don't know now what to say [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5253.78s)]
*  Because they'll say hey look at how I did on sui bench. Look at how I did on IMO. Look at how I did on Amy and [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5259.46s)]
*  The problem the dirty little secret of these model makers is that these guys are so trained on the evals that they're overfitting [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5266.38s)]
*  Yeah, and all this overfitting basically makes it pretty unreliable [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5273.9800000000005s)]
*  And so this means to translate into plain English for humans listening is they basically are optimizing for the test that are the benchmark [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5277.78s)]
*  Yeah, which is kind of like a person in high school or you know optimizing for the SATs [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5285.66s)]
*  It doesn't mean they're gonna be great student, but it may mean that they just spent a lot of time taking SAT tests [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5290.34s)]
*  Yeah, so we have we have one problem, which is that I think it would be very valuable for the industry that it be solved [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5294.86s)]
*  Which is that we need to have? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5300.139999999999s)]
*  extremely difficult and always changing [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5302.299999999999s)]
*  third-party independent [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5305.66s)]
*  Verifiable benchmarks. Oh, that's a great like the safety tasks for cars is that's not run by the companies got it [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5307.139999999999s)]
*  Less about safety though more about capability [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5313.66s)]
*  Sure, and I think if we're reporting on that then these leaps will mean something more than what they are today, right? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5315.82s)]
*  When Alibaba pushes Gwen this week it was an exceptional model [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5321.780000000001s)]
*  It's probably one of the better open source if not the best open source model out there deep seeks. I think is also quite good [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5326.740000000001s)]
*  It doesn't get any press anymore [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5332.860000000001s)]
*  So I think we're starting to get to this place where there's such abundance [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5334.46s)]
*  That actually people are just kind of like overwhelmed with all the choice and they don't know how to differentiate [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5338.5s)]
*  This is like a hundred Michelin star restaurants opening up in your city [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5343.34s)]
*  You just don't have enough meals to eat it we're basically drowning in abundance to [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5347.26s)]
*  Freeberg's point. We I don't think we understand exactly how golden [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5352.46s)]
*  How golden this golden age is in terms of technology distribution becomes really important. I think that's why absolutely we [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5356.34s)]
*  Access very valuable, but also I think Google just said that they're gonna drop an AI button right into the front door core search page [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5363.66s)]
*  I don't know if you guys saw that but doing it when you're logged in you will get the snippet at the top [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5370.88s)]
*  Inside of YouTube they're doing [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5376.18s)]
*  summaries of the chat and the comments and then you think about what meta could do, you know [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5378.42s)]
*  They already put the AI box up there, but you know, they'll knock some of that off [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5383.3s)]
*  No, I'm not on the Google front door like Google.com. Yeah, does anyone use that anymore? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5386.34s)]
*  Well, I mean Google searches are still going but and Facebook is about to launch a competitor to chat searching and grok [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5392.14s)]
*  Yeah [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5398.42s)]
*  well [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5398.66s)]
*  they're gonna do a straight up a standalone app and [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5399.06s)]
*  The thing that they are so good at is whenever they launch an app it doesn't matter when they launch it [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5401.58s)]
*  They'll just get it to a billion people. Oh, yeah. I mean that that is super true. All this I think leads to [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5405.900000000001s)]
*  So much abundance what I'm I'm seeing in startups. I was the first investor in a company called superhuman very elegant software [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5413.12s)]
*  Luxury software for email productivity. Give it a shot. What he did was [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5421.26s)]
*  I didn't mean that's a super plug here. But anyway, I'm so in love with the company and the founder [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5426.5s)]
*  I just had them on this week in startups. It's like one of the best product minds I've ever met keep your ordinary and [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5431.18s)]
*  Superhuman now because it's gotten so cheap to do AI that they are composing in this beta [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5437.62s)]
*  I'm in all of the replies to your email in real time on the back end and you can see potential drafts [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5443.74s)]
*  They summarize everything even if you never read the summary that would be cost prohibitive [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5449.38s)]
*  Six to twelve months ago, but now it's a no-brainer because they're paid software [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5454.620000000001s)]
*  It's like so this is gonna get very interesting very quick Joe your thoughts on this abundance [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5458.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I'm actually building something on email [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5464.700000000001s)]
*  like you said it works with your team to automatically kind of like [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5466.5s)]
*  You know create reports on everything that comes in and router for you because a lot of our friends when you're a CEO you basically [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5469.5s)]
*  Become a traffic cop. It's actually the emails gonna do it for you [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5474.660000000001s)]
*  It's gonna be really nice, but listen, I'm invested in grok 3 and I'm biased towards Elon [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5477.88s)]
*  But you know a lot of our companies will build on top of multiple of them as well [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5482.44s)]
*  And you know, I think you're talking about cogen. I'm you know in cognition [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5485.48s)]
*  I think a lot of my companies using Devon is actually just like crushing it [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5489.32s)]
*  This stuff's getting like 10 15 percent better every month. It's it's really amazing. It's good for companies like that [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5492.179999999999s)]
*  I'm mostly that level where I'm like using all of them or using a bunch of them that so I love the fact [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5497.48s)]
*  There's always competition because this makes it cheaper or better for me for all my companies [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5501.599999999999s)]
*  I'm building and it's it's not slowing down is the other piece of this. Oh, it's getting better. It's scary actually [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5504.639999999999s)]
*  I thought I would I thought I would ask him to and it hasn't so no that's that's the part that's so [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5510.16s)]
*  Fascinating to me and then there's a really interesting ripple that I don't know if you guys are aware of yet [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5515.68s)]
*  But journalists who have been losing their jobs at a tremendous pace are now being hired by data aggregators to come in [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5520.88s)]
*  Look at queries. Let's say you had an expertise in agriculture [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5528.08s)]
*  Freebird they'll pay you and I actually saw one of these job descriptions [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5531.92s)]
*  40 bucks an hour to sit there and answer questions about agriculture look at answers and refine them and do reinforcement learning [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5535.16s)]
*  we're gonna have a new job class which is people who train a eyes and people who fact-check a eyes and refine a eyes and [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5542.08s)]
*  This could be a 50 to hundred fifty thousand dollar a year job because every time you make the AI a little better [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5550.08s)]

*  I don't know freeburg you get the last take here great job on the abundance angle, which [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5563.88s)]
*  Just pushed a really great discussion here wrap us up with your thoughts on these LLMs and the pace of AI [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5569.88s)]
*  I just agree with tomorrow. I think it's like you got a lot of great stuff here. It's changing every week [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5575.64s)]
*  I'm not paying attention to the details anymore new models come out every week [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5580.84s)]
*  This is like when the internet launched new websites, you know, like this is this is carrying us forward [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5584.72s)]
*  It's impossible to dissect and predict [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5589.8s)]
*  What's gonna win when and why what are you obsessed with in the AI front is there are there things? [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5592.84s)]
*  I use chat GPT research a lot [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5600.08s)]
*  The deep research right where the fires off a bunch of web pages. Okay, and you're paying that means the 200 bucks a month [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5602.88s)]
*  Or you have a 200 a month. Yeah. Yeah. No, I find it very good [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5608.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then we build everything at Oholo on GCP and we've run a bunch of different models [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5611.5599999999995s)]
*  That's Google's cloud for people who don't know that correct. Yep, and then we run models. They're incredible. Yeah [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5616.84s)]
*  Yeah, lots of different tools, but it's awesome. Hey as we wrap here [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5623.04s)]

*  We're suited up because the czar the wolf of the White House is here my brother [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5855.18s)]
*  David sacks we were trying to get you on the program [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5860.86s)]
*  You were gonna make a drop-in to talk about all this great crypto news coming out of the White House [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5863.7s)]
*  and let's face it this was a [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5867.9s)]
*  Some people saying chaotic some people say intense. This is a pretty amazing [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5871.0199999999995s)]
*  Intense week for the administration so we'll get into a little bit of that, but you're here specifically to talk about [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5875.18s)]
*  the crypto reserve so welcome back to your program the all-in podcast David sacks [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5881.34s)]
*  Good to be back. I see that you've suited up here. Yeah, I mean I figured I was for people who weren't here for the pre-show [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5887.34s)]
*  I get on sacks is wearing a white shirt in a tie. I'm wearing a blazer and a white shirt [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5894.3s)]
*  So I'm like, ah, I gotta go put a tie on he's like, ah, Jake. I wear a blazer [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5899.3s)]
*  I gotta go to blitzer so then we came back and here we are and well look [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5902.68s)]
*  I just have to correct one thing. I think it's been a very smooth week at the White House [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5906.42s)]
*  The president has lived up to one of his campaign promises. This is not something new [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5910.18s)]
*  I remember you go all the way back to his national speech during the campaign and he [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5914.780000000001s)]
*  Reiterated this many times that he wanted to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5918.94s)]
*  So as he called it a digital asset stockpile what we've ultimately done here is both [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5923.28s)]
*  He also in his week one e on crypto you guys remember I came on the show to talk about that [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5928.18s)]
*  He asked our president's working group on digital assets to evaluate the idea of a reserve or stockpile [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5932.44s)]
*  And we made a recommendation and this administration is moving at tech speed [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5938.599999999999s)]
*  It's really great to work for an administration where you can actually get things done and things move quickly [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5943.36s)]
*  We made our recommendation and then we work with the lawyers to implement it and president signed it last night [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5948.320000000001s)]
*  But this is like consistent with everything. He's always said agree on that the I guess the one criticism that you're gonna get when you go [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5953.860000000001s)]
*  Face the media so I'm not gonna put it here is the order in which you're doing things. Sometimes mr. Trump is very [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5961.4800000000005s)]
*  Expressive on the social medias, which is better than let's say the previous administration [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5966.88s)]
*  Which just wasn't available and in cognitive decline [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5971.46s)]
*  So I guess the the the question of he announces something and then you guys [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5973.900000000001s)]
*  Explain it deeper. Is that the optimal way to do this? [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5980.0s)]
*  Should we not worry about it? Should you come out with like more official stuff? [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5983.22s)]
*  I guess that's the move fast break things that we are used to in Silicon Valley [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5987.26s)]
*  But that people you know, whether it's in business or maybe a little concerned about that things are maybe [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5991.82s)]
*  different now in [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=5998.7s)]
*  The White House and any and how we're running our government maybe you can expand on that [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6000.320000000001s)]
*  Have you ever considered that maybe you just had an overreaction to a tweet? Well, okay [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6003.88s)]
*  So if we're gonna place the blame on me [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6008.16s)]
*  Only one the original crypto OGs were like wait a second [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6012.6s)]
*  Why is he picking these three and not these three, you know? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6015.92s)]
*  So that made a lot of people putting myself out of it like whoa, what's going on here? [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6018.8s)]
*  Is he picking favorites and that's I guess everybody's big concern. So maybe you could have swaged that up. Yeah [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6022.92s)]
*  We're not picking favorites, obviously except I will say this we do think Bitcoin is special and I can get into the reasons why [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6028.1s)]
*  That's a great thing. Yeah. Well, I mean big coins the original cryptocurrency. It's the first one [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6034.82s)]
*  It's the only one that doesn't have an issuer right? It's it's very decentralized. It's you know crypto [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6039.82s)]
*  They call this the immaculate conception. We don't really know how it got here. We don't know who's Toshi [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6045.0199999999995s)]
*  It's almost mystical you would say yes [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6049.34s)]
*  It's the most valuable one who has a two trillion dollar market cap and it's the most secure. It's ever been hacked, right? [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6052.22s)]
*  So we're now you know over 15 years into this journey and there's been a lot of people who've been skeptical on the way and there's [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6057.14s)]
*  Been a lot of ups and downs but here it is. I mean I remember back in 2011 [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6062.52s)]
*  I think it's the first time I bought a Bitcoin. I think it was at $120 now. It's at [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6067.04s)]
*  $90,000 again, there've been all sorts of wild swings [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6072.56s)]
*  Along the way, but this thing just keeps keeps chugging along and you can think of that [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6076.4400000000005s)]
*  Two trillion dollar market cap is like a two trillion dollar bug bounty if there was a way to hack this [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6081.54s)]
*  There's every incentive in the world and a buy hack [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6087.66s)]
*  I mean like to double spend great basic counterfeit Bitcoin [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6090.58s)]
*  I guess to be the way for people to think about it. It is a miracle. It hasn't been compromised [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6094.06s)]
*  I think we can all say that I don't know if it's a miracle. I think it's exceptional design [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6098.42s)]
*  Sure [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6102.38s)]
*  And so I think I think what you could say is that it's been [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6102.900000000001s)]
*  Tested in a very robust way and there's been every incentive to basically break the encryption [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6105.900000000001s)]
*  And it continues to chug along and so I think the price has gone up as the protocol has gotten more acceptance [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6110.4800000000005s)]
*  And this is another point is that [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6116.78s)]
*  Bitcoins most widely accepted as a store of value throughout the world [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6119.36s)]
*  Yeah, so we do believe it should be treated special now that being said we're also creating the digital asset stockpile [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6123.52s)]
*  So all the other explain the difference between these two. So there's a digital asset stockpile [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6129.24s)]
*  That's the picker and then on the other side there's a strategic reserve for Bitcoin because we do acquire Bitcoin [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6134.98s)]
*  We the United States of America when we seize from terrorists, you know criminals, etc [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6142.0199999999995s)]
*  We do seize these and then we often make the mistake of liquidating them when maybe we should be holding them [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6147.58s)]
*  Yeah, so it's right. Okay architecture. So we have the reserve we have the stockpile [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6152.339999999999s)]
*  So the reserve is just Bitcoin. The goal is long-term preservation [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6155.36s)]
*  Think of it as like a digital Fort Knox for digital gold. We want to put the digital gold in there [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6158.78s)]
*  We want to keep it secure. We never want to sell it [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6164.18s)]
*  That's the goal of the reserve and you're right that we've made the mistake in the past of selling this stuff at one point in [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6166.52s)]
*  Time we had about 400,000 Bitcoin on the federal balance sheet [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6171.92s)]
*  We sold roughly half of that for something like 360 million dollars total [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6174.46s)]
*  If we had held all of that it would be worth just that the portion we sold would be worth over 17 billion [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6179.84s)]
*  So we made this mistake a prematurely selling Bitcoin when we should have held it [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6184.740000000001s)]
*  We don't want to make that mistake with regard to the rest of it [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6188.56s)]
*  We think there's around 200,000 coins left on the federal balance sheet [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6191.900000000001s)]
*  But the truth is that nobody knows because we've never done a proper audit [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6197.18s)]
*  So part of what this executive order provides is that we're gonna do for the first time a [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6200.4400000000005s)]
*  Government wide accounting of the digital assets that we actually have so digital assets [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6205.1s)]
*  Emerge in some department. I don't know the FBI sees as some the CIA sees as some [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6211.26s)]
*  I don't know which organization winds up having them [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6215.36s)]
*  They're gonna be legally required to report that and then put them in the reserve [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6217.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, they'll they'll be legally required to report it and then they'll go in the reserve if there's a final adjudication [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6223.02s)]
*  so, you know, obviously if those coins could go back as restitution to victims or if [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6228.3s)]
*  The person who they were seized from wins their court case and gets them back [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6235.18s)]
*  They're not gonna go into the Federal Reserve [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6239.14s)]
*  But if there's been a final adjudication and a final forfeiture, yes, those will go into the reserve. Anyway, that's Bitcoin [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6240.9s)]
*  Okay, so then you got the stockpile. Let me just talk about that [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6247.46s)]
*  So first of all, like I said, we don't know exactly what digital assets the federal government has [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6249.6s)]
*  I've seen reports that it might have for example 50,000 ETH which is aetherium [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6255.2s)]
*  But again, we need to get to the bottom of that when we figure out exactly what the assets are [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6260.64s)]
*  We're gonna move them into the digital stockpile [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6265.12s)]
*  The purpose of the stockpile is responsible stewardship. It's a place for safekeeping [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6267.72s)]
*  It's a centralized you could say account under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury and [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6272.5s)]
*  The Secretary of the Treasury will figure out how to maximize the values of these holdings now [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6278.7s)]
*  There's a couple of important differences between stockpile and reserve [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6282.62s)]
*  So one is the reserve the executive order actually provides that the Secretary of the Treasury will not sell the Bitcoin [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6286.18s)]
*  Okay, we're prohibited from selling the Bitcoin [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6293.86s)]
*  There's no such prohibition with respect to the stockpile if the Secretary of the Treasury decides that's in [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6297.2s)]
*  The long term interest of the US to rebalance the portfolio or change the portfolio [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6302.48s)]
*  The Secretary has the discretion to do that [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6306.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay, which makes sense because there's a long tail of crypto [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6308.5599999999995s)]
*  We might see something that we don't have the ability to predict the predict the future and we don't have the staff [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6311.36s)]
*  To sit there and look at these assets every day like a fund manager wouldn't say huh [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6316.5599999999995s)]
*  What do we do with these? What percentage should it be of the overall stockpot of the overall holdings? [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6320.719999999999s)]
*  So maybe the decision with the theorem is hey this thing's waning [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6324.9400000000005s)]
*  We just put it into Bitcoin because we know that's the more solid one. Yeah, that's what I'm reading into it [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6327.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that that's that's largely fair [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6331.74s)]
*  I mean look I think that the stockpile should be subject to good portfolio management, right? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6333.9400000000005s)]
*  Unfortunately, we have a Secretary of the Treasury who is an extremely successful former hedge fund manager [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6339.42s)]
*  So he's gonna figure out the best way to manage these assets and we give him the flexibility to do portfolio management [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6345.1s)]
*  Whereas like I said, I live and die with that what he does [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6351.3s)]
*  He has to make those decisions and that's gonna be you know part of how he's evaluated by the president [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6353.54s)]
*  So hopefully he's gonna be sharp about that, right? [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6358.44s)]
*  But the reserve is different right the reserve is just digital for Knox now. There's one other important difference between stockpile and reserve [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6360.56s)]
*  So with respect to to reserve the the EO provides that the secretary's that I'm talking about Treasury and Commerce [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6367.4s)]
*  They're allowed to figure out strategies to accumulate more Bitcoin for the reserve if those strategies are budget neutral and don't cost the taxpayer [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6373.96s)]
*  Anything okay, so it's possible that we could I'm not saying that we will but it gives them it authorizes them to [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6382.160000000001s)]
*  Acquire more Bitcoin if they can figure out a way to do it that doesn't impact [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6389.26s)]
*  The federal budget or the deficit or taxpayers, right? Okay. Well, I had a very simple suggestion for this which I'll [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6395.06s)]
*  Float up the flagpole here and see what you think you probably we've talked about it on previous [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6402.3s)]
*  All ends before you want it. How about a simple crypto tax, you know crypto wants to be legal [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6406.780000000001s)]
*  You're the crypto czar [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6411.56s)]
*  Crypto wants to be regulated. They want the rules. They want the rails simple suggestion from your bestie [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6413.56s)]
*  Why don't we charge every transaction in the United States point? Oh 1% just about 1 bit in that native currency [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6419.72s)]
*  So you want to trade some Solana for aetherium for XRP whatever, you know, put in whatever names you want there [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6425.900000000001s)]
*  The government says hey, you want to have a great vibrant system here [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6431.6s)]
*  We're gonna need to take just the most modest of taxes de minimis [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6436.52s)]
*  In the native crypto and put in the stockpile [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6441.64s)]
*  This seems to me like a very that's always taxes start is that they're very they're described as being very modest [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6444.64s)]
*  You know when the income tax started it only applied to like a thousand Americans [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6450.54s)]
*  Yes, the legislators swore up and down that it would never be applied to middle-class people [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6453.72s)]
*  So I don't particularly like the idea of new taxes [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6458.76s)]
*  Even if it's it's promised that they just won't affect people very much that sounds burdensome to me [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6461.64s)]
*  But look we have very successful this would and just so you know [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6466.9800000000005s)]
*  This is would be like more like a sales tax that would be handled by Coinbase would be handled by Robin Hood [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6469.66s)]
*  But it would be handled by those platforms. They would administer it. It would be a transactional tax not an income tax [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6474.22s)]
*  So if you have a bunch, it's not a wealth tax and a seizing tax [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6480.18s)]
*  But I'll let you look at on it [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6482.5s)]
*  Yeah [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6483.98s)]
*  If you can convince if you can convince the Secretary of the Commerce or the Secretary of Treasury to run with your idea [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6484.3s)]
*  Then great it could potentially happen. I mean they have the flexibility to figure out budget neutral ways to accumulate Bitcoin [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6490.86s)]
*  I don't know what those ways are gonna be but they're creative [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6496.46s)]
*  They're very successful businessmen and if they figure out a way to do this then it can be considered. That's the okay [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6499.74s)]
*  Well, I'll be in the Commissary later having lunch with you. You can introduce me [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6505.66s)]
*  So let you let me just give you a fastball here. Well, we'll see if it if it gets in the strike zone [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6508.9800000000005s)]
*  The appearance of impropriety is what people are concerned with the picking of winners and losers [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6513.9s)]
*  President Trump was the crypto president. He went and he gave that famous speech. I'm gonna get rid of Gary Gensler [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6520.54s)]
*  We're gonna make it legal and to his credit. He has fulfilled that promise which means hey the donor class on that side said [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6526.16s)]
*  We're gonna back the crypto president not the anti crypto team, which means a lot of people who are on the Twitter and the socials [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6533.16s)]
*  Have donated a lot. They have a lot of holdings. So this appearance which you've now I would give you credit have cleaned up here [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6540.76s)]
*  Hey, there's two different things going on here and we're not using taxpayer money. We get all that [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6548.54s)]
*  But the appearance here is hey, maybe somebody's gonna benefit of course that came after you first for that without the facts [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6552.9400000000005s)]
*  You were very clear. You cleared all your positions. You sold everything you divested [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6559.3s)]
*  So let's make that clear to the dumb dumbs who are just trying to say that you're personally [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6563.56s)]
*  Yeah, please cuz this is ridiculous. Yeah. Well people came out right away and were saying that somehow I was engaged in a scheme to [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6568.9400000000005s)]
*  Pump my bags or to basically create eggs of liquidity for myself and billionaire stuff like that [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6575.860000000001s)]
*  You have to understand that those accusations [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6580.86s)]
*  I mean they're accusing me of a crime and a serious crime and they're doing it with no evidence whatsoever [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6582.9s)]
*  So these things are basically it's more laughter slander and that's landless [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6588.58s)]
*  Yeah [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6593.54s)]
*  I would say in any event what they didn't know and what I then proceeded to put out there is that I sold all my [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6593.78s)]
*  cryptocurrency prior to day one of [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6599.9s)]
*  The administration because I didn't want to even have the appearance of a conflict and by the way, I could have waited [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6602.139999999999s)]
*  I didn't have to do it like that [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6607.98s)]
*  but I decided to do it and take it upon myself to do that because [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6609.82s)]
*  You just know that when it comes to crypto, there's gonna be a lot of fluctuations in the market [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6613.54s)]
*  You never want someone to be able to point at one of those fluctuations and say somehow that the cryptos are [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6617.46s)]
*  Benefited from that and create a conspiracy theory, which is exactly what basically happens [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6622.7s)]
*  So first of all, I got rid of all my cryptocurrency prior to day one [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6626.46s)]
*  craft also [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6630.0199999999995s)]
*  Sold craft is the venture firm that you funded that's done a lot of great work supporting founders here in South Valley [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6631.62s)]
*  So we basically sold I think it was around 200 million dollars of crypto of which around 85 million [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6636.82s)]
*  Dollars was personally attributable to myself and we cleared that before day one [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6643.179999999999s)]
*  Pay taxes on it and basically so there wouldn't be a conflict. So then [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6648.0599999999995s)]
*  The smear shifted in another direction was okay. Well, maybe he doesn't own crypto. Okay, but he's in crypto funds [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6652.259999999999s)]
*  Okay, and so they pointed to you know bitwise and multi-point capital and I was also in blockchain capital [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6658.42s)]
*  And so then the fund managers came out and one by one all said actually David called us over two months ago and said [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6664.84s)]
*  He's gonna need to divest from our funds. And so we also did that so yeah, you know [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6671.88s)]
*  I think basically they've kind of given up on this but look it's very easy for why let the facts get in the way of [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6676.8s)]
*  a good slander seriously, you know full disclosure, you know [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6682.0s)]
*  You when you saw me doing the Sequoia scouts program said hey, why don't you do a fund? I'll be the anchor [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6686.2s)]
*  I'll be your first LP. But I mean one of the most generous things you've done in our relationship [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6690.68s)]
*  And I had to have a call with you, you know weeks ago and say hey, okay, you're gonna divest. Okay, fine [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6695.08s)]
*  No problem. No, it's not not a problem for me [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6701.0s)]
*  You sell the assets to somebody else so the way people understand how this mechanically works when you're in a fund [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6703.320000000001s)]
*  You have no [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6707.88s)]
*  Sax cannot tell me what to do in the fund [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6709.320000000001s)]
*  He just put money in it like I put money in other people's funds [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6711.52s)]
*  They go and invest and ten years later you get a return and hopefully that return in a venture firm or private firm beats [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6713.92s)]
*  The markets public markets or whatever, but then you can also sell that interest to somebody else [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6719.02s)]
*  So mechanically and this takes time and you have to sell it at 50% 25% off and it's painful you will lose [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6723.64s)]
*  I estimate you're going to lose [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6730.88s)]
*  You know, I don't want to be gratuitous here [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6733.8s)]
*  but eight nine figures by serving the country for a couple years and [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6735.360000000001s)]
*  Not only that the great irony of this is the one thing holding back the industry is [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6739.6s)]
*  Regulation over regulation of AI and no clear regulation in crypto [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6744.84s)]
*  You're going into fix the two things that were number one and two on all of our agendas in Silicon Valley in terms of getting [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6749.04s)]
*  Returns the next four years. So the sacrifice you're making is extraordinary and you're making it a better environment a regulated environment [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6755.4800000000005s)]
*  For the rest of us to do commerce. So I just want to point out that you're losing like double here, right? [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6763.0s)]
*  Well, let me let me just underscore something you say your service and I don't know how much to pay how much they paying you [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6767.68s)]
*  Put this child. What do you get paid like 50 grand 100 grand? [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6772.56s)]
*  I'm an unpaid consultant to the government really is that actually you get no [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6775.44s)]
*  No, I don't want anything you money [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6779.04s)]
*  No, of course it is but it's it's it's an honor to serve and it's a honor to be asked to serve and in particular [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6781.38s)]
*  It's an honor to serve this president because he really wants to make the country great again. So that's why I'm doing it [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6787.4s)]
*  But yeah, look, I think it's a it's a lazy and stupid narrative to say that the reason why someone who's already successful in [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6792.32s)]
*  Business goes into government is to somehow make more money. I was making money before this involves a substantial disruption of [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6800.12s)]
*  My business interests and I have to divest a lot of those business interests and in divesting [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6807.56s)]
*  I have to be either a taxpayer or I have to take a significant discount and it costs you money. So, yeah [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6812.360000000001s)]
*  It's just a lazy narrative that people create [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6818.12s)]
*  But there's no truth to it and just to underscore a point that that you made a second ago [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6821.08s)]
*  You were one of the funds I divested from not because you're a crypto fund [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6825.68s)]
*  But because you might have a crypto position we went through I think the launch funds holdings [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6829.2s)]
*  And I think there was something crypto related in there and so you one or two that pivoted into crypto. Yes, right [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6833.96s)]
*  So I just didn't want to have any problem there. So listen, it's this is the nature of the politics we have [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6840.0s)]
*  People are you know, it gets very personal, you know that better than anybody and so, you know, that's why you're here [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6846.68s)]
*  and hopefully we can clean this all up and [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6851.92s)]
*  Let people know that hey the intent here is good [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6855.32s)]
*  So just to go back to one other point you said about not picking winners and losers [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6857.98s)]
*  I think that's a very important comment that you made that I see as fundamental to my job [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6861.68s)]
*  I mean look, I think we do think that Bitcoin is special for the reasons I said beyond that [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6865.8s)]
*  We do not want to be in the business of picking and choosing winners in in the space [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6870.88s)]
*  and again if some other digital asset could prove that it's as [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6875.16s)]
*  Decentralized and as secure and as widely accepted as a store of value as Bitcoin [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6880.88s)]
*  Then maybe it could be elevated in the same way that Bitcoin has I mean, I'm laying out the criteria for you [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6885.96s)]
*  But look beyond that we don't want to be picking winners and losers in the space and that's not my job [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6890.72s)]
*  I mean my job is not to [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6895.32s)]
*  To be a regulator or to anoint which ones are good or bad [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6897.92s)]
*  It's to basically be a policy advisor for innovation and I'll just tell you the way that I see the you know [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6901.4800000000005s)]
*  All the digital assets in the space is that what's fundamental is disclosure if you're an issuer of a digital asset [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6907.8s)]
*  You need to disclose, you know all the material facts about what you're doing and those facts have to be accurate [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6913.66s)]
*  You can't lie [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6919.4400000000005s)]
*  My view is that if you if you the issuer lie about something [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6920.4400000000005s)]
*  The government should come down on you like a ton of bricks because that's fraud [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6924.400000000001s)]
*  Okay, but as long as you do this in an honest way people should be able to trade these things [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6927.6s)]
*  I understand that you think a lot of them are garbage. You might be right [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6932.52s)]
*  You could express that view in a trade [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6936.12s)]
*  But as long as everyone has been above board in terms of disclosure [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6938.36s)]
*  People should have the right to trade these things and some are gonna make money. Some are gonna lose money [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6942.58s)]
*  It's about the freedom to basically to trade to hold these assets [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6946.32s)]
*  The government doesn't want to get in the way of that [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6950.44s)]
*  It just wants to make sure that the information is out there that is honest and if people lie in [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6951.92s)]
*  Order to profit I'm all in favor of going after them [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6957.48s)]
*  Well, and you know we already have in regulated market as an analogy and when you tell a lie and [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6960.5199999999995s)]
*  You sell a share in a company whether it's a private or a public company [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6966.639999999999s)]
*  The SEC has a term for that it's called securities fraud and we you know have this new type of [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6969.719999999999s)]
*  Device it's very innovative. It could be an NFT. It could be a trading card [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6975.32s)]
*  It could be an actual utility token where you burn it in use of a service or it could be [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6978.959999999999s)]
*  Anything it could be whatever the person describes it as but what's important is there's an entity [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6984.5599999999995s)]
*  With a group of people I think you would agree who have said we have ownership of this [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6989.7s)]
*  We're incorporated here in the United States not in Panama not in the BVI [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6994.26s)]
*  Not in some you know other place where maybe they're a little faster or looser with regulations [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=6998.7s)]
*  You got to be here in the US. Maybe you have to be insured in some way [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7004.5s)]
*  Maybe there has to be a board like there does in Delaware or in an LLC [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7007.78s)]
*  There has to be some person where the buck stops and if you lie [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7011.4800000000005s)]
*  While committing a transaction or taking money for an asset [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7015.68s)]
*  It would be securities fraud and yes people will come down on you like a ton of bricks [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7019.44s)]
*  And if you promote things and you don't disclose it well, we have rules about that as well [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7023.48s)]
*  We saw many celebrities get pinched last time [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7028.04s)]
*  for [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7031.52s)]
*  Tweeting about cryptocurrencies and and this is the stuff that I think has to stop [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7032.76s)]
*  I think it should feel more like what we do in angel investing the private companies and in public companies. So that's your job [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7037.4s)]
*  When are we gonna see you know that framework emerge because here you're only like 40 50 days into this I think [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7043.660000000001s)]
*  When we see the actual bones of a framework [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7049.860000000001s)]
*  So if I want to do j coin and I want to make an angel investing coin or I want to do something fun [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7053.700000000001s)]
*  And then FT collection for all in or something [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7058.8s)]
*  When will we have the actual rules of the road and that and that's gonna be multiple agencies, right? [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7061.26s)]
*  What you're describing is is known in Washington or that the the the area of policy that you're describing is known as market structure and [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7066.34s)]
*  Market structure is about providing a clear framework for market participants. It would define what is the security? What's the commodity? [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7074.38s)]
*  What's simply a collectible, you know, it's property, but it's not a security and then what are the rules for each category? [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7081.06s)]
*  That's known as market structure. There is a bill that passed the last Congress in the house [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7087.88s)]
*  But Biden basically he didn't veto it but he basically he and the Democrats [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7092.88s)]
*  He stopped in the Senate the Democrats did it was called fit 21 and it was authored by [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7097.679999999999s)]
*  French Hill who's now the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7103.44s)]
*  So we expect that he will be introducing a new version of his bill probably in the next few weeks [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7107.32s)]
*  I don't think I'm breaking any news by saying this [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7113.04s)]
*  I think people [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7115.099999999999s)]
*  Expected and that's gonna provide the framework for market structure [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7116.08s)]
*  It's gonna provide a lot of the definitions that you're talking about now. I agree with your sentiment [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7119.76s)]
*  Okay, but I will say that I might have a different view than you have. What is the security? What's not? [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7125.56s)]
*  I mean to me collectibles are not securities, but if it's a collectible you got to disclaim that look this has no [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7130.74s)]
*  Intrinsic value, right? That's a collectible think about a baseball card. The baseball card is a piece of cardboard [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7138.08s)]
*  It has no intrinsic value [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7143.28s)]
*  But the value comes from basically other collectors being willing to buy it from you and you could just say that that's irrational [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7144.4s)]
*  Whatever, but so look I think as long as people disclaim that this coin has no intrinsic value [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7150.92s)]
*  They should be able to issue meme coins. It's a separate question [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7157.36s)]
*  Why people would want to buy him but look that's very in my view [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7160.66s)]
*  That's very different than someone who goes out as an issuer and says I'm issuing a token or a coin that has lots of functionality [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7164.44s)]
*  And has lots of value and you'll hear some of these guys even say that hey our [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7171.84s)]
*  Token is more valuable than Bitcoin. You should value it more highly [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7177.08s)]
*  Well, if you're promising that and you're saying that it's gonna have certain functionality you better be telling the truth about it [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7180.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, then we start getting into the how we test and people can go look that up if they want it [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7185.8s)]
*  What I will say is there's an educational process that has to come in here [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7190.0s)]
*  Which we've gone through as the United States when people would buy interest in mines [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7193.8s)]
*  People would buy interest in gold claims oil fields and that's when a lot of these regulations came out in the 20s around [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7197.5599999999995s)]
*  Accreditation we've spoke about this before it's a pet peeve of mine [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7204.36s)]
*  but I think there should be an educational framework here and I think there should also be some nuance that you could work on specifically [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7207.0s)]
*  with this group of [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7213.0s)]
*  Being clear that when you have a ticker symbol associated with something or you do charts associated with something [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7215.04s)]
*  You know, it starts to smell like a dog. It looks like a dog [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7221.88s)]
*  It's quacking like a duck but then in the terms of services is hey, this is a collectible [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7224.92s)]
*  I think there needs to be some ground rules, which maybe it says hey these need to be presented in a certain way at the top level [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7228.72s)]
*  So the nuance of disclosure is so important when I tweet something if it was an [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7236.04s)]
*  Advertiser or a sponsor of all in or this week in startups or any influencer you did that would you do this? [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7241.6s)]
*  And you said I love you know this brand you and I both were well [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7247.42s)]
*  You were an investor in eight sleep. I am if we were to tweet about that as investors [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7251.68s)]
*  We don't have to disclose but if we were paid for that the FTC has rules you have to put this is a paid partnership [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7256.4400000000005s)]
*  You cannot confuse [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7261.84s)]
*  Consumers and I think that's where you're gonna have to do a little bit of clean up work and structure as well as the [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7263.96s)]
*  Disclosure and how this appears and then also maybe [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7269.04s)]
*  The educational system so, you know if you want to own a firearm if you want to drive a car if you want to be [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7273.320000000001s)]
*  You know a beautician and listen we can talk about over regulation you gotta take tests [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7279.12s)]
*  Man, it would just be so much better if consumers can take you know, like a 50 question test just to say hey they understand [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7283.12s)]
*  What we're talking about here in terms of diversification so they don't you'll Yolo their entire mortgage in-house into one crypto [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7290.84s)]
*  So what are your thoughts on those two issues? [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7298.160000000001s)]
*  Disclosures how it's presented and then accreditation and maybe a path to accreditation sophisticated investor test [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7299.88s)]
*  How I refer to it for all Americans because 90% of people can't participate in [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7305.84s)]
*  Private companies your thoughts. Well disclosure is the key. Like I said, I mean these projects should have to disclose certain things [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7310.68s)]
*  I think for example the token cap table should be disclosed. Who are the great are the insiders? How much do they have? [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7316.8s)]
*  When are they selling? You know, that's that's information [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7322.68s)]
*  The market should always know in my opinion easily done with the technology lauded by the crypto community the blockchain [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7325.92s)]
*  This was always the problem we had as venture capitalists with hey, this is a token project who owns the tokens [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7333.04s)]
*  Where are they? When can I sell when you sell the insiders? Yes [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7338.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you have disclosed everyone owns a token that could be hard to comply with but I think you should have [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7342.62s)]
*  This is my person you should have the insiders and their their sales plans and their lockups and and and I would also say how [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7347.2s)]
*  New tokens get created. I mean if this is a fully centralized [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7354.48s)]
*  Token where they can just meant more people need to know that because there's no scarcity, right? [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7358.900000000001s)]
*  But if there's somehow an enforcement mechanism and there's enforced scarcity, then that's a different story [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7363.46s)]
*  So yeah, these things have to be disclosed and by the way, I think the market structure bills will do that [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7369.14s)]
*  There's a version of this in fit 21 last Congress [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7374.42s)]
*  I think it'll be the next one and moreover the SEC is looking right now at these rules and they're gonna create their own frameworks [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7377.06s)]
*  They're doing an excellent job. I see chief. I was doing some research on him [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7383.46s)]
*  He's a really pro actually more Americans being able to invest in privates private equity, etc [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7387.7s)]
*  It and he's given speeches on it in the past [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7393.38s)]
*  So the person who's been nominated for the new chair of the SEC is named Paul Atkins and he he has not been confirmed yet [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7395.28s)]
*  The confirmation hearings still need to happen separately [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7400.3s)]
*  Hester purse who's a commissioner at the SEC is in charge of I know Hester [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7403.62s)]
*  I've had her on this week in startups a couple of times. She's great. She's excellent [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBoGJlpSdpY&t=7407.26s)]
