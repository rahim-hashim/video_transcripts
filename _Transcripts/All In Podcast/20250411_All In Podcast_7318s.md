*  former treasury secretary under clinton former director of the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=104.4s)]
*  National economic council under obama and the president of harvard from 2001 to 2006. Thanks for coming larry. It'll be with you [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=107.68s)]
*  Okay, we have a lot to get to here so we might as well talk about [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=115.52s)]
*  The big news of tariffs. It's day 80 of the trump presidency [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  And a second presidency his second term and trump tweeted that he paused tariffs for everyone [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  But china on wednesday, basically, let me just cue up the details larry and then we'll get your take on all of this [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=132.96s)]
*  Just one week after liberation day [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump announced on truth social that in effect he was raising tariffs against china 125 [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=142.4s)]
*  Based on their lack of respect quote-unquote [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=149.92s)]
*  Instead of negotiating and that he was pausing reciprocal tariffs on all other countries for 90 days [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=153.04s)]
*  And markets ripped 10 after he posted this and today thursday when we tape [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=159.6s)]
*  There's been a massive sell-off on wall street. So the roller coaster ride continues [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  What it will be on friday when you consume this podcast is anyone's guess [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=170.56s)]
*  S&P is down five percent today [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=175.12s)]
*  For context the s&p was at 5700 pre-liberation day [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=177.76s)]
*  So about a nine percent drop [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=182.16s)]
*  after these wild swings [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=184.4s)]
*  And uh, in fact, this has been historic [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=186.8s)]
*  volatility [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=190.86s)]
*  Here are the top [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=192.4s)]
*  Sell-offs in history as you can see three of them came during black monday in 1987 three of them came [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=194.72s)]
*  During the financial crisis three of them came during covet and coming in 11th is trump's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  tariffs [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=209.58s)]
*  Also in the gainers, uh, you have these big rebounds [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=210.88s)]
*  Wednesday's 9.5 recovery was number three [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=215.12s)]
*  The administration says this was all part of a master plan [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=218.72s)]
*  We'll hear more about that later and that they laid a trap for china. They laid a trap [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=221.6s)]
*  besant has been the spokesperson [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=226.88s)]
*  during this retreat or [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=230.56s)]
*  Whatever we're going to call the pause and quote [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=233.04s)]
*  This was driven by the president's strategy. He and I had a long talk on sunday and this was his strategy all along [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=237.12s)]
*  I don't think we need to play the clip. That's the gist of it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  The white house count then tweeted in all caps my favorite way to tweet do not retaliate and you will be rewarded [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=246.72s)]
*  wall street journal on the other side posted a story about why trump blinked the chronicle the decision as uh, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=254.0s)]
*  being affected [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=260.32s)]
*  By jamie diamond who went on fox to express fears of recession while saying the tariffs were valid [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=261.84s)]
*  And that he knew the trump and cabinet will be watching him on fox other banking executives who felt they didn't have a lot of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=267.68s)]
*  Influence in this administration according to the wall street journal started lobbying republican lawmakers [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=273.76s)]
*  That the trump tariff plan would tank the economy the white house chief of staff suzelle started receiving calls from executives and lobbyists expressing concerns [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=279.36s)]
*  And uh the wall street journal reports that trump was influenced heavily by besant. They were flooded with [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=288.32s)]
*  worried calls from wall street [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=293.84s)]
*  And that the president was uh lobbied to find an off-ramp trump ultimately relied on his instincts [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  According to the administration larry is this 4d chess? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=303.28s)]
*  Or is this something else? What are your thoughts? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=308.56s)]
*  This is uh [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  Dangerous work with a sledgehammer [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  On a pretty sensitive machine, which is the global economy [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=317.12s)]
*  That's having really serious, uh consequences [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=321.84s)]
*  First it's important to understand that there's more tariffs that are around [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=326.0s)]
*  Than you described [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=332.16s)]
*  Even after the big back off there's a 10 across the board tariff [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=334.0s)]
*  a range of structural tariffs like on steel and automobiles [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=339.6s)]
*  And a range of new tariff threats like on [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=344.64s)]
*  Pharmaceuticals [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=349.34000000000003s)]
*  Here's a kind of market-based estimate of [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=350.64s)]
*  What the damage that the market thinks this is all doing to the u.s. Economy is [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=354.48s)]
*  Markets down. Let's take today's number nine percent [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=360.56s)]
*  If that's right [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=364.56s)]
*  That would be about four trillion dollars [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=366.08s)]
*  Of course the four trillion dollars since liberation day, of course markets were down coming into liberation day [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=370.48s)]
*  Because of some anticipation of these policies [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=378.32s)]
*  So let's be conservative and say these policies have taken six trillion dollars off the stock market [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=381.52s)]
*  Now the stock market only measures the adverse impact on corporate profits [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=388.47999999999996s)]
*  Not the adverse impact on workers not the adverse impact on consumers. So you need to add to that [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=394.0s)]
*  uh stock market number [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  Uh, one way of thinking about adding to it would be to say that corporate profits were 10 percent of the economy [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=404.4s)]
*  So you could argue for multiplying by a factor of 10 [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=411.52s)]
*  But maybe that's being too [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=415.12s)]
*  Exaggerating or too bold. So let's multiply by a factor of uh five [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=417.26s)]
*  And what you get is a loss in the 30 trillion dollar range [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=423.92s)]
*  as the present value as estimated by markets [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=428.72s)]
*  of [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=432.88s)]
*  What's being done? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  Now I know that trump administration sometimes likes to say it's working for main street not wall street [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=435.6s)]
*  I noticed that they're pretty excited about the stock market rally [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=441.76s)]
*  Yesterday in a way that wouldn't really go with uh, not caring about uh [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=445.41999999999996s)]
*  markets [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=452.94s)]
*  So I think what markets are seeing what's is what's true [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=454.0s)]
*  Which is three things [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=459.44s)]
*  this is [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=462.24s)]
*  an inflation shock [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=464.0s)]
*  Because you're adding to prices [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=465.84s)]
*  CEO of amazon got it right [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  The secretary of the treasury got it wrong [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=472.24s)]
*  Increases in tariffs of this magnitude [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=475.18s)]
*  The overwhelming part of them will be passed on to consumers [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=478.0s)]
*  So you've got an inflation shock [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=483.92s)]
*  When you raise the prices of people and their income at least in the short run is the same [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=486.64000000000004s)]
*  They're poorer [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=492.56s)]
*  And that means they can afford less stuff [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=493.92s)]
*  And that pushes the economy [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  down [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=499.36s)]
*  And so you've got higher inflation [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=500.47999999999996s)]
*  and you've got um more [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=504.23999999999995s)]
*  less demand [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=507.67999999999995s)]
*  and therefore more [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  unemployment and all of that's bad for the economy and companies [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=511.09999999999997s)]
*  And the last thing which I think is profoundly [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=515.28s)]
*  important [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=519.98s)]
*  Is we are trading like an emerging market country right now [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=521.28s)]
*  for [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=526.88s)]
*  Serious countries for the united states [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=528.0s)]
*  The pattern is that when the world gets riskier [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=531.68s)]
*  The bonds go down in yield [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=536.88s)]
*  And the currency goes up in value [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=539.68s)]
*  Because people come for the safe haven [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=542.56s)]
*  When they're a country like argentina [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=546.0s)]

*  Falling stock prices go with higher bond yields go with a weakening currency [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  And so because of our erratic behavior [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=559.2800000000001s)]

*  Is a is a pattern [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=614.64s)]
*  of america being governed on the kind of one perrone argentina model [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=617.36s)]
*  And that sometimes produces some benefits for some people in the short run [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=624.0s)]
*  That sometimes generates popularity [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=629.28s)]
*  Uh for it perrone kept coming back in argentina [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=632.24s)]
*  But ultimately it's extremely costly for our society [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=637.54s)]
*  Uh, you've you've heard uh larry's uh take on all of this larry's giving it about a b plus on the harvard great scale [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=642.42s)]
*  Which might be inflated i'm not sure sax obviously in the administration you cover two things ai and of course crypto [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=651.22s)]
*  And you're a member of the pod so let's get your take on [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=661.38s)]
*  What happened this week with these tariffs even the most ardent [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=665.3s)]
*  Supporters of trump have felt this is chaotic [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=670.5799999999999s)]
*  Not well executed not communicated well [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=673.86s)]
*  What is your take sax on how this was executed and could this have been done better? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=677.38s)]
*  Well, I think what happened if you go back to liberation day was only eight days ago is april 2nd if I had told you [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=683.14s)]
*  on [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=690.18s)]
*  april 1st [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=691.06s)]
*  That donald trump would find a way to get the entire world to [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=692.58s)]
*  eagerly embrace a 10 tariff on the american market and not only would they not complain but they'd actually be relieved [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=696.74s)]
*  That it was only 10 you would have said that would be an april fools joke [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=704.4200000000001s)]
*  If I had told you eight days ago or nine days ago that trump would find a way to accelerate [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=708.1s)]
*  The united states is decoupling from china, which is something he's long wanted to do [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=714.1s)]
*  And that wall street would basically breathe a sigh of relief over that [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=718.58s)]
*  You would have said that there's no way that could happen [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=722.58s)]
*  If I had told you eight or nine days ago [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=724.9000000000001s)]
*  That president trump figured out a way to assert a presidential power in a way that gives america extraordinary leverage [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=727.7s)]
*  Over virtually every country in the world [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=733.46s)]
*  You would have said why I don't believe it. I don't you know [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=735.7s)]
*  What is that power and he proceeded to do that? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=738.26s)]
*  and now basically every country in the world except for for china is coming to washington seeking to [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=740.82s)]
*  Negotiate a new trade deal for the united states on better terms for the u.s [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=746.72s)]
*  If you told me any of that a few days ago, I would have believed you [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=752.02s)]
*  And I would have thought the consequences [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=756.58s)]
*  Would be a substantially deteriorated [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=759.3000000000001s)]
*  American economy and a substantially less secure. I don't think we know that i don't think we know that it's not any surprise [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=762.26s)]
*  There's nothing surprising [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=769.38s)]
*  About the fact that the united states has the power to extort lasoto [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=771.3000000000001s)]
*  It's just and that's that's the country that was singled out in the trump formula [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=775.5400000000001s)]
*  For the highest level of protection there is no surprise [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=780.1800000000001s)]
*  In uh that there is no surprise that the united states has the capacity to isolate itself from china [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=786.1s)]
*  It will be very very costly. Japan is coming to washington south korea is coming to washington [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=793.78s)]
*  Everybody's going to try to cut everyone's going to come to washington never would have occurred to anyone with experience in government [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=798.02s)]
*  That the united states would have any difficulty [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=805.0600000000001s)]
*  Getting any major country to come send a representative to the united states to have a discussion and a negotiation [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=807.86s)]
*  with a [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=815.9399999999999s)]
*  United states on a matter that was of concern to the united states [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=817.38s)]
*  Never could possibly have come as any surprise sacks reply to that and then ezra i'm going to bring you in sacks [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=820.9s)]
*  Go ahead you reply [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=826.66s)]
*  Then why didn't they larry? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=828.34s)]
*  Do you think that all these countries were going to renegotiate their trade deals with the u.s? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=830.34s)]
*  If president trump asked nicely if he said pretty please let's renegotiate our trade deals [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=834.9s)]
*  So you take down your trade barriers that they would have done it if he had said pretty pleased with a cherry on top [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=839.06s)]
*  That's not the way these things work [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=843.62s)]
*  He had to establish the leverage in the negotiation first and the fact of the matter is he's the first president in decades [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=845.3s)]
*  Who's been willing to do that? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=851.78s)]
*  You don't get anywhere by just asking nicely [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=853.38s)]
*  And I think that what president trump did over the last eight days is a establish the leverage [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=855.9399999999999s)]
*  And b get all these countries to now want to negotiate a new trade deal with the united states if this is such a terrific thing [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=861.38s)]
*  Why do markets think it's so terrible for the american economy? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=869.0600000000001s)]
*  Maybe there's maybe the market's just completely wrong, but at least another possibility [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=873.46s)]
*  Is the question is the market's judging this that the market i mean job of markets [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=879.1400000000001s)]
*  Is to look forward [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=884.74s)]
*  It's to look past the immediate it's to see what the long-run consequences are going to be [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=886.34s)]
*  And markets are making a pretty devastatingly negative [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=892.6600000000001s)]
*  Judgment true not true. Larry that's not true that feels emotional and nice, but it's just not accurate [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=896.58s)]
*  So let's just establish a couple facts [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=903.0600000000001s)]
*  About quote unquote the markets number one [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=905.46s)]
*  There are two markets and they behave totally differently and sometimes inversely to each other. There's the stock market [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=908.82s)]
*  And there's the bond market with respect to the stock market [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=915.78s)]
*  What they are debating and you're right. Larry is what is the effective long-term rate of return? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=919.46s)]
*  A dollar needs to generate in order to pay me back that dollar. That is what the fundamental stock market does [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=926.5s)]
*  And what we have seen for many years with trade imbalances [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=933.0600000000001s)]
*  Trade deficits and close to zero interest rates of which more of that happened under democrats and republicans [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=937.7s)]
*  We have allowed the stock market to inflate past historical averages [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=944.76s)]
*  What we've actually seen happen in the last week is what most people would call mean reversion [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=950.92s)]
*  The stock market is still way above where it was last year two years ago three years ago [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=957.16s)]
*  What has happened is that the ford multiples have compressed so that's number one [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=964.1999999999999s)]
*  That's a fact you can debate whether that's bad or good and i'm willing to debate that with you [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=967.9599999999999s)]
*  Okay, now let's go to bonds [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=972.44s)]
*  Yeah, and then with respect to bonds what we are seeing now is there are two very complicated issues and we don't know [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=973.96s)]
*  What the unknown known is and let me be very specific [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=981.48s)]
*  In the last two days we saw one part of the bond market totally get out of whack [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=985.24s)]
*  And what we know is that the yields changed materially [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=992.12s)]
*  in a very acute way [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=996.2s)]
*  Which is atypical of how the bond market? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=998.2s)]
*  Typically digests a philosophical change in approach to policy [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1001.2199999999999s)]
*  Normally when you see an acute reaction in the bond market [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1006.42s)]
*  The underlying reason tends to be some financial calamity [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1010.28s)]
*  In a participant what we heard in the last 24 hours is a lot of this move may have been attributed [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1015.0s)]
*  To an enormous levered bet [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1022.92s)]
*  On us treasuries by a japanese hedge fund [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1025.72s)]
*  It will take three and four and five and six weeks for us to really know separately what we do know though [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1029.72s)]
*  Where the structural complexity of the market and this is where larry I agree with you [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1036.36s)]
*  Is acute and important to observe is in the credit markets for private companies [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1041.6399999999999s)]
*  And that is where you have to pay a lot of attention [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1046.6s)]
*  Okay, larry, let me let you respond to shimab's response to you and then azra. I promise you're going to come in next [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1049.8s)]
*  larry go ahead [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1056.52s)]
*  rontha [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1057.96s)]
*  As you well know [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1058.92s)]
*  the vast majority of financial thinking [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1060.52s)]
*  emphasizes [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1063.94s)]
*  changes in the earnings prospects of companies [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1065.32s)]
*  Associated with the strength of the economy as a major source of stock market fluctuations [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1069.14s)]
*  And if you look at dividend strips if you look at what's happening to analyst revisions [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1075.0s)]
*  That's got a lot to do negative prospects for the economy has a lot to do [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1081.08s)]
*  With why the economy why the stock market has turned downwards? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1086.44s)]
*  The foreign exchange market is very big [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1091.64s)]
*  And it's a big referendum on whether people have confidence [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1094.2s)]
*  in uh the united states and somehow [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1098.92s)]
*  tariffs reduce imports are supposed to reduce dollar selling and make the currency go up [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1103.08s)]
*  And not only is the currency not going up [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1109.8s)]
*  It's going down [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1112.76s)]
*  Substantially, so we're seeing a pattern [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1114.82s)]
*  Maybe it's all just due to one japanese hedge fund [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1118.12s)]
*  But maybe we're seeing a pattern that really looks that looks pretty much like [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1121.32s)]
*  Uh the argentine pattern as right you uh are hearing this debate [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1127.4799999999998s)]
*  I think there's no debate that this was done in a very extreme fashion at a minimum. Do you wonder? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1132.36s)]
*  If this could have been done in a more gradual or thoughtful way [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1139.08s)]
*  What's your take on the execution here by the administration of these tariffs and their response to the market? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1143.16s)]
*  I can't say I wonder if it could have been done in a more gradual thoughtful way [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1149.72s)]
*  It could have I I defer to larry on the markets. I'm more of a connoisseur of arguments and something i've been thinking about over the past [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1153.0s)]
*  very long eight days [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1160.12s)]
*  Is covering the 2024 election and covering donald trump's tariff promises [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1162.36s)]
*  And it was a thing that liberals like me were doing where we do these shows and say donald trump is promising a 10 [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1167.5600000000002s)]
*  Percent to 20 global tariff and then 65 tariff on china [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1173.4s)]
*  And if he does that it'll have this set of effects higher prices. It'll create financial uncertainty, etc [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1178.3600000000001s)]
*  And what I would be told like the the counter argument [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1184.1200000000001s)]
*  Was oh you libs [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1187.72s)]
*  You always take him [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1189.72s)]
*  Literally when you should be taking him seriously i'd be back ramaswamy on my show [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1191.3s)]
*  He said he's not going to do that. That's just a negotiating ploy and this was the the common line [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1195.48s)]
*  from trump allies on wall street [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1200.6s)]
*  And then I watched as he began doing not just that but layering a series of them bilateral tariffs on top of that plan [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1203.3999999999999s)]
*  The markets began freaking out while they were freaking out a bunch of his defenders said no no [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1212.6s)]
*  Actually these tariffs which we told you were never going to happen are actually a great idea [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1216.76s)]
*  We need to reset the entire global financial system and you can't ship those tectonic plates without creating a few earthquakes [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1221.64s)]
*  Then the moment the tariffs paused with the 90-day pause on the tariffs on top of the 10 percent and the china tariff [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1229.8000000000002s)]
*  Then I heard nope that pause is genius. Haven't you read the art of the deal? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1236.6000000000001s)]
*  And what I would observe from this [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1241.16s)]
*  Is it usually when an idea is good? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1243.72s)]
*  You don't need people jumping back and forth on it so often going between these tariffs are a bad idea [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1246.68s)]
*  But they're a smart negotiating ploy to these tariffs plus are an actually great idea and you should all calm down as trump said [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1252.44s)]
*  You should all be cool back to know these tariffs are a great idea [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1258.28s)]
*  I think something i'd love to hear from david. It's very hard to break the the pattern being a podcast host [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1262.04s)]
*  I would like to hear [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1267.72s)]
*  What the measure of success in two years is? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1269.56s)]
*  Right we can sit here and speculate about the effect of these and i'm much more on on larry's side the one i'm hearing from [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1273.0s)]
*  from chamath and david, but [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1278.2s)]
*  If what are your measures what in two years? Good question if manufacturing employment or whatever is below x [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1280.92s)]
*  Will you be unhappy if gdp is what what is a sort of? [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1289.0800000000002s)]
*  Objective yardstick where we could come back in 700 days and say did this work out or was this a bad idea? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1293.38s)]
*  Good i would say probably the biggest thing would be [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1301.16s)]
*  Whether the us can re-industrialize to some extent so that we're not completely dependent for our supply chains on [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1304.2s)]
*  On a potentially hostile adversary and what is the measure of that? Is it the the quantity of manufacturing we're making? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1310.6000000000001s)]
*  Is it the share of manufacturing? I don't think it's a hard thing to understand. You know during coven [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1316.52s)]
*  We learn you to set it very tightly. I am saying it concisely [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1321.16s)]
*  During cova we discovered that we were horribly dependent on a supply chain from china for some of our most essential products [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1325.4s)]
*  for pharmaceuticals for [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1332.12s)]
*  Other medical gear that we needed during cove sure [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1333.8799999999999s)]
*  So what would be if you were to put a metric on it as one example? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1336.68s)]
*  But we've also learned that our entire supply chain for all sorts of industrial products now is dependent on china and other countries [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1340.12s)]
*  So let's be more precise. We have four percent on employment [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1347.32s)]
*  At the record low of our lifetimes and do you think americans want to [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1350.68s)]
*  Work in these factories and if so, which factories obviously pharmaceuticals? That's a dependency obviously building ships and weapons [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1355.56s)]
*  That's a dependency. I think we can all agree on that and that might be hundreds low hundreds of thousands of jobs [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1361.8s)]
*  Do you believe we should be making nike sneakers here? Do you believe we should be making jeans here again? [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1366.44s)]
*  What would be the objective measure of success like a certain number of jobs certain number of factories certain [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1372.2s)]
*  Types of factors because the other piece that I don't understand and maybe you can inform me here sax is number one [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1378.44s)]
*  Who's going to do this work if we're going to be deporting millions of people? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1385.1599999999999s)]
*  And we have the lowest unemployment of our lifetimes and we have automation coming to these factories and americans don't want to take these jobs [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1389.8s)]
*  Historically, how is this all going to work? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1396.74s)]
*  It seems a bit farcical to me that we're going to bring these things back [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1399.0s)]
*  I don't think the the millions of americans who lost their jobs in the heartland because we let china into the wto [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1402.68s)]
*  Which is something that larry I think supported and championed. We're talking about decades ago, right? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1408.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's what started this whole thing. Yeah, okay. I don't think those millions of people want to lose their jobs [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1412.8400000000001s)]
*  You're talking nonsense. What are you talking about? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1417.96s)]
*  David you're treasury secretary when we name one when we walk china to the wto and you're just still defending it [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1421.24s)]
*  I'm just watching an interview. Hold on larry david larry. You just did an interview with neil [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1427.48s)]
*  May I ask my question? Why am I the only one who gets to talk for two seconds before I get interrupted? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1432.92s)]
*  Okay, you guys get five to ten minutes finish your thoughts finish your thoughts for two three minutes [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1436.8400000000001s)]
*  And then i get to speak for two seconds then you interrupt me you speak for five or ten minutes go right ahead larry. I just saw [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1440.76s)]
*  You do an interview with neil ferguson where he asked you was it a good idea to bring china to the wto? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1447.16s)]
*  Was it a good idea to give them permanent? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1453.4s)]
*  normal trade relations status basically mfm [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1455.88s)]
*  Which is something that bill clinton did in 2000 and I admit it was bipartisan george w bush continued it [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1458.76s)]
*  Was and you were defending this as a good idea for the country [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1465.24s)]
*  What was the result of that over the past 25 years millions of industrial? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1469.0s)]
*  Jobs were lost or exported china millions of factories shut down the united states has a diminished and hollowed out industrial base [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1473.24s)]
*  We certainly can't make the products of the future like drones or semiconductors. Jason just to answer your question [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1480.68s)]
*  Yeah, obviously some industries are more strategic than others. Do I personally care about sneakers or textiles? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1486.6000000000001s)]
*  No, I personally don't do I care about semiconductors? Absolutely. Do I care about circuit boards? Do I care about drones? [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1492.68s)]
*  Do I care about robots? Do I care about evs and cars? Absolutely [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1498.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1503.24s)]
*  Those industries we are no longer in a position [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1504.3600000000001s)]
*  We are no longer in a position as a country to make those products because we exported our entire supply chain [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1507.16s)]
*  Many factories to china, so how was that a good idea larry? Okay, larry you go and then azar i'll go back to you and shimon [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1513.24s)]
*  Go ahead three questions for you [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1519.8799999999999s)]
*  one [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1522.04s)]
*  Can you name? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1523.08s)]
*  a single trade barrier [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1524.76s)]
*  That was reduced [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1527.08s)]
*  By the united states associated with china accession [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1528.84s)]
*  A single restriction that existed [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1532.6s)]
*  In the united states that had not been in place for five years before [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1535.4s)]
*  that we removed [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1540.44s)]
*  During china's wto accession. Can you name one? I don't think we should have done any of it larry [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1542.36s)]
*  We threw open our markets of chinese goods what restriction? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1547.16s)]
*  Your your thesis [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1551.08s)]
*  Is that we threw open the market and therefore we exposed ourselves to all of this china thing [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1553.16s)]
*  And question i'm asking you is can you name? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1560.04s)]
*  any [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1563.8799999999999s)]
*  restriction on chinese exports to the united states [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1565.46s)]
*  That was in effect in 1999 [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1569.96s)]
*  And was removed by our wto accession [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1574.12s)]
*  in 2000 [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1578.12s)]
*  Can you name any such restriction just name one for this was a policy that built up over time and it was basically made permanent [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1579.56s)]
*  Hold on. It was made permanent when we walked china to the wto and gave them mfn status. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'll ask the question one more time [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1586.1999999999998s)]
*  We had given them mfn status [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1594.36s)]
*  15 years before [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1597.96s)]
*  No one [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1601.56s)]
*  They had mfn status. They had it for 15 years. There was not a single [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1602.76s)]
*  Reduction in a barrier to chinese trade [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1609.3s)]
*  So the way in which you're describing it is just there's no resemblance to what it was [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1613.48s)]
*  Bring them into the wto. What was the point of bringing them into the wto? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1619.8799999999999s)]
*  Was bringing them into the wto was to use the leverage that we had [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1623.08s)]
*  to win a whole variety of concessions that enabled us to [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1628.1999999999998s)]
*  um [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1633.6399999999999s)]
*  Larry let's be honest more to china. This is an interesting idea. It's called reciprocity. This is an extraordinary [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1634.4399999999998s)]
*  Let's move forward [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1643.08s)]
*  All right, listen, this is a bad deal hold on a second. I want to let's go back to this just a minute [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1646.52s)]
*  I just want to know [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1650.6s)]
*  The the whole argument you are making [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1652.44s)]
*  is about [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1655.8s)]
*  Increased exports to the united states that had bad consequences. And so i'm just going to keep asking you [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1657.3200000000002s)]
*  What barrier? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1664.6000000000001s)]
*  That previously existed [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1666.2s)]
*  Okay, i'll name them. I'll name them. I'll name them. Go ahead. Let me get you in this [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1668.52s)]
*  Prior to the wto china imposed a bunch of export duties and taxes on a whole bunch of goods to control outflow [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1674.68s)]
*  Okay that prioritized domestic supply as part of coming into the wto china said hey, hold on we'll limit these export duties [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1680.2s)]
*  to only a specific set of products [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1687.96s)]
*  And then they capped those duties at agreed rates [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1691.08s)]
*  Number two, they eliminated export quotas. They historically had export quotas to manage the volume of goods [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1694.04s)]
*  Under that wto commitment. They agreed to phase out all those quantitative restrictions on exports except were explicitly justified under wto [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1700.52s)]
*  Number three, they removed the export licensing restrictions number four [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1708.2s)]
*  They ended state trading monopolies for exports number five. They liberalized foreign trade rights. The point is [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1711.8s)]
*  People thought that china was going to be a honeypot of economic activity [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1717.3999999999999s)]
*  And it turned out to be a sucking sound a grand sucking sound of opportunity [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1721.8s)]
*  Where the globalist corporation saw a massive labor arbitrage? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1726.68s)]
*  So it's fair to say that it was done with the best of intentions, but it was a bad deal [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1730.76s)]
*  I they got one over on us. I really want to say that rather than having [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1735.88s)]
*  30 minutes of debate over something that happened in the 90s. I would I would like to go back to this question [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1739.56s)]
*  I keep not hearing I will answer your question because that was a great question from david. Um, but i'm i'm i'm love your stuchum [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1744.3600000000001s)]
*  To just begin talking in an anecdotal way [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1753.88s)]
*  Okay, we want to move forward I would like to announce these policies and then there's never [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1757.8s)]
*  There's give me give me what indices you are going to look for where if it's if in for two years it is under x [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1763.16s)]
*  I can come back and we can have a conversation. Here's the metrics as i'm so sorry. Here's the metrics for you [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1770.2s)]
*  Okay, let's go back to bilklin's speech that was given at johns hopkins on march 9 2000 [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1774.68s)]
*  He was asking about forward david forward looking metrics. What would you think would be successful two years from now? [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1779.96s)]
*  Not the history lesson. Wait, hold on. We haven't finished the debate about china and pntr. Okay, but my question predated that debate [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1784.28s)]
*  Yeah, we're trying to change the subject. Let's just finish up on this topic. We're trying to move forward. That's all [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1790.92s)]
*  We're trying to finish up on this topic. Okay, okay [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1795.72s)]
*  We'll let you get the last question about this. Okay, you can have the last one march 9 2000 bilklin announces pntr [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1797.6399999999999s)]
*  At johns hopkins. It's a very famous speech leah. Maybe you can tell us about how it got written [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1804.6s)]
*  Anyway, bilklin promises several things. He makes a number of arguments for pntr [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1809.4s)]
*  He does not think that this does nothing larry. Your argument is that bilklin didn't do anything [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1815.0s)]
*  You're saying that somehow it happened under reagan or something like that. That's not what bilklin was arguing [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1820.52s)]
*  He said number one there'd be huge economic benefits for the u.s [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1825.0s)]
*  He says quote by this agreement. We will increase exports of american products [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1828.28s)]
*  He means to china that will create american jobs. Okay, did that happen the way we intended? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1833.32s)]
*  I don't think so number two is he believed that when you looked at the data on export flows from the united states to china [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1838.04s)]
*  It actually did happen at a quite substantial rate [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1844.36s)]
*  But with huge trade deficits for the united states [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1848.1200000000001s)]
*  You're arguing that they they did not okay a discriminatory way towards our products [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1851.48s)]
*  This idea that americans could just do business in china the way that they could do business here is ridiculous [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1855.64s)]
*  Anyone who tried to do business over there knows you have to create a jv. You have to get a local partner give him 51 [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1860.1200000000001s)]
*  It was extraordinarily difficult. We were discriminated against larry. Okay ridiculous to try and claim that somehow this was an equal relationship [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1865.8s)]
*  Okay, and we imported far more from them than we ever exported to them. So bilklin was wrong about that number two [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1873.3200000000002s)]
*  He said that signing pntr and bringing china to wto would promote democracy in china [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1880.2s)]
*  That we would export one of democracy's most cherished values economic freedom. Did that happen? I don't think so [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1887.0800000000002s)]
*  He said this would strengthen global trade by ensuring china adhere to international trade rules reducing trade barriers and resolving disputes through wto [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1892.76s)]
*  Did that happen? I don't think so and then he said on national security [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1901.72s)]
*  He said it would improve our national security to bring china to wto and help make them rich [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1905.8s)]
*  He said quote if we don't deal with china in this way, we'll increase the prospect that they will turn inward [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1910.44s)]
*  That's not what happened. We helped make china rich. We've exported millions of jobs to them [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1915.56s)]
*  They built up their economy and their supply chain to the point where now they are a global competitor to the united states [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1919.6399999999999s)]
*  They're a pure competitor. We turned that baby dragon into a drogon size monster that can now [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1924.44s)]
*  Challenge us in asia and across the world for primacy. Why in the world we have done that just for national security reasons [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1930.68s)]
*  That was a very foolish thing to do [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1938.28s)]
*  Okay, so larry, I I guess I have to let you maybe self-grade. How did you guys do? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1940.44s)]
*  Is there any regrets as sax is pointing out there? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1945.8799999999999s)]
*  Obviously china has not magically become a democracy, but I guess you could argue they do have a middle class now [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1949.08s)]
*  We haven't gone to war with them. So I guess you could argue that this has been good for relations [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1954.28s)]
*  But to sax's point they are incredibly powerful and they are our top adversary. How would you grade the history of this so we can move forward? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1958.76s)]
*  I was [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1965.72s)]
*  a surging growing [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1967.32s)]
*  reforming economy [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1970.26s)]
*  growing at double digit rates [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1973.08s)]
*  That it was [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1976.28s)]
*  Before there was any wto agreement [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1978.04s)]
*  The wto agreement did not change a single rule [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1981.0s)]
*  That represented a u.s. Restriction [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1985.72s)]
*  on [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1989.08s)]
*  imports from china [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1990.12s)]
*  It did change a variety of rules [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1993.08s)]
*  Not as far as I would have liked [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1996.36s)]
*  That let the united states export more to china [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=1999.0s)]
*  And the protected united states intellectual property [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2003.24s)]
*  in china [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2007.4s)]
*  And that brought china [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2009.56s)]
*  more closely [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2011.64s)]
*  into [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2013.48s)]
*  the international system [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2014.68s)]
*  You need a counterfactual [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2017.0800000000002s)]
*  For what would have happened [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2019.24s)]
*  If china had been excluded from the world trade organization [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2021.24s)]
*  That counterfactual is not [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2025.88s)]
*  That they would not have sold goods to the united states [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2028.28s)]
*  that [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2031.72s)]
*  Principle had already been crossed 15 years before [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2032.66s)]
*  not a single [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2037.0800000000002s)]
*  restriction was [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2038.98s)]
*  Reduced so but look anything you would have done differently, but I just don't get [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2041.5600000000002s)]
*  I I don't get the whole [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2046.04s)]
*  Mindset [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2049.3s)]
*  Here I understand that we should have done more as a country [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2051.0s)]
*  For the rust belt and invested in it much more heavily [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2055.24s)]
*  If I was worried about dependence and strategic and all that [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2059.64s)]
*  The last policy I would have [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2063.88s)]
*  Wanted to abolish was the chips act [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2066.36s)]
*  That's the largest boldest thing the united states has ever done [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2069.8s)]
*  to [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2074.2799999999997s)]
*  Avoid dependence in a national security area. Great. Let me bring chamath the trump administration has killed all of that [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2075.38s)]
*  Chamath you heard ezra's original question and the history here from larry and david [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2083.0s)]
*  Looking at there are some industries that we need strategically pharma military cars. These are fairly obvious rare earth minerals [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2088.44s)]
*  Uh are obvious [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2096.6800000000003s)]
*  But we also have the lowest unemployment of our lifetimes [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2098.76s)]
*  And americans probably don't want to work in factories en masse [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2103.1000000000004s)]
*  What is your take on going forward some metrics that this administration should not sax is saying this you're saying it [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2108.0600000000004s)]
*  what what would you [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2116.2200000000003s)]
*  measure this [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2117.98s)]
*  Success as in terms of on shoring and reducing dependencies if to ezra's point two years from now [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2119.5s)]
*  We were to grade it give us some specifics here chamath. There is a major [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2125.9s)]
*  Issue that the united states has that's much bigger than china which can be framed in the lens of [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2129.74s)]
*  Resiliency and the ability to fend for ourselves [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2138.52s)]
*  There are supply chains that have many single points of failure [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2142.54s)]
*  And independent of whichever country that single point of failure exists. It could be an ally [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2147.3399999999997s)]
*  Or it could be a foe or it could be a frenemy [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2153.8999999999996s)]
*  That creates risk [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2156.9399999999996s)]
*  And I think what we are learning and david's right. It was really highlighted during covid [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2159.1s)]
*  We are not in a position to take care of what we need. So if I had to very precisely answer ezra's question [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2164.2999999999997s)]
*  I would say that we need to measure [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2171.3399999999997s)]
*  and protect four [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2173.8199999999997s)]
*  critical areas [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2175.9s)]
*  Everything else I think we can deal with some inefficiency some single points of failure, but the following four areas ezra, I would say are [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2177.58s)]
*  sacrosanct [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2186.12s)]
*  Number one is all of the technology both the chips as well as the enabling technology around artificial intelligence [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2187.5s)]
*  It must be a robust [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2196.38s)]
*  Largely american supply chain it must you cannot have single points of failure outside the united states because what you see is even in allied countries [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2199.1s)]
*  Their posture towards things like free speech and other things can ebb and flow [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2209.1s)]
*  Their posture on trade their posture on defense, okay, so that's okay. It can change chips got it number two is energy [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2213.66s)]
*  We have a critical deficit of electrons in america [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2219.98s)]
*  We do not have the capability we need to make the energy we need quickly in many ways [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2224.14s)]
*  We have supply chain issues on nat gas [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2230.7s)]
*  We have critical supply chains that can be shut off by china around photovoltaics [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2233.66s)]
*  So whether you believe in coal whether you believe in nat gas whether you believe in clean energy [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2238.24s)]
*  We are in a very we got to shore that up. Okay, I think we're in agreement keep going number three [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2243.2s)]
*  Are there are critical material inputs that drive the material science of the future? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2247.7599999999998s)]
*  Rare earths are an example going back to chips things like gallium [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2253.44s)]
*  things like phosphorus even so we have a [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2258.7999999999997s)]
*  Critical minerals and rare earths and and material science input problem [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2261.36s)]
*  And then the fourth azra are pharma apis so that when american citizens get sick [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2268.48s)]
*  We have the ability to not just make it but also design it and manufacture it because some of these apis [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2274.08s)]
*  The active principal ingredients for many of the drugs require very convoluted and complicated processes cold chains and the like and again there [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2280.4s)]
*  We depend on folks [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2289.7599999999998s)]
*  Whose view of the united states can change in real time [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2292.64s)]
*  So if I had to say to you as for what I would expect is if the united states government whoever was in charge [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2296.24s)]
*  Would put those four things on a board then detail out all of the key inputs measure how much we can make ourselves versus import [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2301.6s)]
*  And then basically try to level that playing field [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2309.52s)]
*  We would be in a very good place a couple things because I think I probably agree with [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2311.6s)]
*  All of that and what it sounds like is an excellent argument for joe biden's policies [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2316.3199999999997s)]
*  Which were functionally maybe not the farm aside just literally that let's pull out semiconductors and the semiconductor supply chain [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2321.12s)]
*  Let's pull out energy. Let's plot a couple of things like that [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2328.16s)]
*  You know, what was it a high fence around a small garden is what jake sullivan called it. Let's particularly try to restrict [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2331.44s)]
*  The supply chain export of ai critical materials to china [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2338.3199999999997s)]
*  They had a whole set of policies about this now the trump administration the thing we are in theory here discussing [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2343.2s)]
*  Is an extraordinarily broad-based set of policies. Um, it is tariffs on not just china. It's on brazil [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2349.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not just on critical industries like chamath is talking about but it's on, you know [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2356.48s)]
*  mangoes and avocados and you know lumber from canada and and basically everything else [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2360.86s)]
*  I guess there's an argument I could sort of extract out of this that [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2366.16s)]
*  The biden administration believed in what they called friend shoring, which is that you want to create an integrated supply chain [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2370.0s)]
*  Of of allied countries that we can work with and that we can rely on and the trump administration [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2376.0800000000004s)]
*  I think believes something depending on who's talking more like that the entire supply chain needs to be onshore to america [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2382.6400000000003s)]
*  specifically [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2390.5400000000004s)]
*  But one of the problems and the reason I i'm keep trying to push people to be very clear about their arguments and very clear [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2391.5200000000004s)]
*  About their metrics is that I feel like there's this king's cup of what we're trying to achieve here where one day [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2396.72s)]
*  It's that we're trying to achieve the reindustrialization of the american heartland and the next we're trying to [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2402.3999999999996s)]
*  Replace the income tax with tariff income and then the next we're just using it [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2406.8799999999997s)]
*  As all-purpose surplus leverage against any country that does anything we don't like and the next day we're, you know using it for [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2410.9599999999996s)]
*  An entirely third purpose and maybe we're just going to use it to to isolate china but to bring in our friends [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2418.72s)]
*  But none of these you can't do all of these things at once and it needs to be very stable [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2424.6400000000003s)]
*  If you're going to get companies to do these long-term cap ex investment decisions that take decades to play out [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2430.1600000000003s)]
*  Nobody I know in the markets. The fact is you guys didn't want to change anything you guys didn't want to change anything [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2437.44s)]
*  I wasn't in the I wasn't in the by the administration number one. I'm cheating as well as Larry as a team [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2443.52s)]
*  I would love to change. Okay. I just want to make sure I would change all kinds of things [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2448.32s)]
*  You mean the democrats didn't want to see if we could of course, let's see if we can [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2452.0s)]
*  Won't even admit that pntr did anything. We not keep doing pntr for a minute. Let's look forward not backwards [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2456.16s)]
*  Look at the look at the chips act. Look at the ira act. They did the exact things we're talking about larry [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2461.68s)]
*  Go ahead. Let's see if we can find a little bit of agreement [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2466.64s)]
*  Please here. I agree with jamath's agenda [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2470.64s)]
*  I may not agree in every detail, but I broadly agree with jamath's agenda [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2473.8399999999997s)]
*  And i'll go a little further than that ezra [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2478.72s)]
*  I think joe biden's attachment to energy security was kind of selective [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2482.0s)]
*  and heavily oriented to green technologies [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2487.7599999999998s)]
*  Not others. I thought canceling the keystone pipeline was a clear mistake [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2491.6s)]
*  I thought the stopping a variety of things involving liquid natural gas [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2497.3599999999997s)]
*  Were a clear mistake [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2502.7999999999997s)]
*  so I think the biden administration's approach [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2504.7999999999997s)]
*  to regulation [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2509.2799999999997s)]
*  that empowered every ngo [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2511.04s)]
*  With respect to stopping transmission lines with respect to constructing power plants [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2513.9199999999996s)]
*  Because of the importance of democratic constituencies was a mistake [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2520.16s)]
*  so I think energy security is a central objective of policy and that there's a lot of room to [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2524.56s)]
*  Move beyond what the biden administration did. I actually believe that very strongly and agree with jamath and david what I don't [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2532.24s)]
*  understand [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2540.54s)]
*  is [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2541.9199999999996s)]
*  chips [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2543.68s)]
*  Absolutely, right the chips act was all about [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2545.02s)]
*  Making there be an american semiconductor industry with production in the united states [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2549.04s)]
*  as a central priority [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2555.68s)]
*  the trump administration [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2558.24s)]
*  Has declared war [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2560.24s)]
*  on that [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2562.4799999999996s)]
*  Rare earths you want to have a strategic petroleum reserve for any rare earth [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2563.68s)]
*  You want to do more mining in the areas that jamath says we should in the united states or in friendly countries [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2568.4799999999996s)]
*  I am all for that [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2576.16s)]
*  Here's what I cannot understand jamath [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2578.0s)]
*  They don't see how your resilience agenda [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2581.9199999999996s)]
*  drives anywhere near [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2585.5s)]
*  liberation day [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2588.3799999999997s)]
*  and the emphasis on [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2590.16s)]
*  Tariffs it drives towards a set of specific [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2593.44s)]
*  Industrial policies perhaps including tariffs in some particular product areas [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2597.9s)]
*  but [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2604.4s)]
*  steel from canada [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2605.52s)]
*  Anything from lasoto [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2608.64s)]
*  Any natural resource [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2612.56s)]
*  Uh [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2615.04s)]
*  product [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2616.32s)]
*  Across the board tariffs on everything. I think you are absolutely right [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2617.36s)]
*  about [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2621.52s)]
*  resilience and that traditional conventional economics has given it too little thought [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2622.62s)]
*  And that covet pointed that up as a central issue [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2628.8s)]
*  what I can't understand [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2633.36s)]
*  Is why donald trump's? [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2636.4s)]
*  Echoing of lia coco from the 80s about tariffs [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2639.36s)]
*  Is [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2644.56s)]
*  responsive [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2646.06s)]
*  to [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2647.2799999999997s)]
*  Any of that? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2648.24s)]
*  But this is the point i'm trying to draw around biden i'm not saying I agree with every way the biden administration [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2649.44s)]
*  Defined its objectives. I just wrote an entire book about the failures of democratic policymaking in this specific era [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2654.88s)]
*  What I am saying is the biden administration's view of trade was that there are targeted industries. We should be putting a lot of both [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2660.7999999999997s)]
*  Uh domestic policy and international policy into play in order to protect and reshore or french shore [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2668.64s)]
*  And the trump administration's view is that you have a generalized problem running all across the world that requires highly general [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2675.2s)]
*  Policies that then when I ask people to defend it they sort of move to this targeted argument [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2683.18s)]
*  Donald trump's view we can I feel like we end up [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2687.92s)]
*  Making something that is not that complicated [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2691.2s)]
*  Um into something much more complex than it is since the 80s, you know, larry's point about lia coca [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2694.0s)]
*  Donald trump has seen has appeared to hold the view [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2700.0s)]
*  that any time [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2703.36s)]
*  The us is operating at a trade deficit with someone else [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2705.1200000000003s)]
*  That is uh evidence we are being ripped off and that is how you get at least the initial set of tariffs here [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2708.4s)]
*  That work off of bilateral trade deficits and try to correct every single one with every single country [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2714.7200000000003s)]
*  Be it lasoto or a collection of islands inhabited by penguins [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2721.12s)]
*  I just I think it's really important to be connected to the policy that was actually [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2725.6s)]
*  Announced and not sort of projecting all of our own onto it [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2731.02s)]
*  Like yes larry's right that you could have a different set of critical industries than biden did [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2734.56s)]
*  The biden team was very focused on clean energy over other kinds of energy [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2738.96s)]
*  I also did not agree with like the liquid gas pause [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2742.0s)]
*  I thought there was some you know there and we did not do nearly enough on things like permitting reform, right? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2744.8s)]
*  There's a lot you could have done that they didn't do [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2749.6s)]
*  But if what you have in your head is a targeted idea of reshoring specific [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2752.64s)]
*  Industries or nearshoring or frenchering or whatever which is kind of what i'm hearing from um from a number of people on this call [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2757.9s)]
*  Then it seems like you would want targeted policies and what we have is not targeted policies. It's broad-based policies [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2764.8s)]
*  So a 90-day pause on larger broad-based policies and a huge trade war with china. I would like to hear a defense [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2769.92s)]
*  From somebody okay. I'll give it to you. Ezra and I agree [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2777.2000000000003s)]
*  Specific policies i'd like somebody to explain to me [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2780.86s)]
*  Why it's a remotely sensible theory? [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2784.6400000000003s)]
*  To say that the united states is being exploited [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2787.84s)]
*  by any country [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2791.6000000000004s)]
*  where the overall pattern of trade [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2793.6000000000004s)]
*  is [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2797.2000000000003s)]
*  Such that we are running a trade deficit [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2798.6400000000003s)]
*  And maybe in the process you could explain to me why my grocery store is exploiting me [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2802.0s)]
*  Because i'm running a massive trade deficit with that. Okay trade deficit shamatha sacks who wants to take it? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2807.36s)]
*  I can start the maybe sax can sax it. So let me actually start by giving [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2813.44s)]
*  some credit to where [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2818.48s)]
*  Biden did do a few things right just in the spirit of finding some common ground [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2820.08s)]
*  Inside the ira [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2824.88s)]
*  I think that there were two things and i've said this pretty repeatedly, but I just want to put it on the record again [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2826.88s)]
*  the itc credits [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2832.4s)]
*  and [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2834.7200000000003s)]
*  The itc transfer markets for those credits the tax equity markets [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2835.6800000000003s)]
*  Are critical industries in america to support private investment in all kinds of very complicated [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2840.2400000000002s)]
*  markets energy markets being the most important and what the biden administration did to their credit was [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2847.04s)]
*  Remove the uncertainty because those things had to be renewed over and over again and they gave us [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2854.3199999999997s)]
*  A very long window where we could underwrite investments to your point asra that was smart [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2860.8799999999997s)]
*  But it's important to also remember that in order to get biden's budget done [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2866.48s)]
*  What they did was they had mansion roll over on permitting reform and asra, you know [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2870.72s)]
*  There's probably better than all of us when you look inside of the chips act [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2875.2799999999997s)]
*  As smart as that initial policy was if you ask why has nothing actually happened [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2879.2s)]
*  Why have no fabs actually been built other than? [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2885.3599999999997s)]
*  Grandio statements the answer is that which you speak to in your book [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2888.56s)]
*  It's just this complete malaise and inability to actually get these things permitted and turned on even when it's right [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2892.56s)]
*  So I just want to acknowledge that that's there. So larry to very very importantly to your question [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2899.2799999999997s)]
*  The thing that we have to acknowledge is that in certain countries [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2904.16s)]
*  What you have is a very blurry line between private and public industry and they have this very tight coupling [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2908.1600000000003s)]
*  And again, I hate to go back to china, but it is the best example of this where what do they choose one other country just? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2914.6400000000003s)]
*  For the sake of it. We can use korea. We can use japan [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2922.0800000000004s)]
*  We can use germany. Okay [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2925.76s)]
*  There are instances where the government balance sheets support private industry. They can support them in three different ways [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2928.0s)]
*  Number one is the tax credits that they can use the subsidies that they can use to build the things that they need [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2936.16s)]
*  Number two is how then they can support that in the active selling and engagement in public spot markets [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2943.52s)]
*  To shape the demand curve of the things that are made [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2950.16s)]
*  And then number three is the taxation on the back end the terms of repayment and the capital cycle [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2953.8399999999997s)]
*  Those are things that in the united states we overwhelmingly [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2960.64s)]
*  Turn the responsibility [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2963.78s)]
*  Over to the private markets to do we are the cleanest the purest form of capitalism in that sense [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2966.26s)]
*  But many other countries are shades of this and again, let's not talk about china [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2974.34s)]
*  So so larry hold on a second. So larry. So what do you have is how do you defend? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2979.94s)]
*  Dumping, how do you defend that? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2985.06s)]
*  How do you defend spot market manipulation that drives american companies out of business? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2987.3s)]
*  How do you fight that and I think here's the problem if president trump had [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2991.78s)]
*  Announced a big broadening of [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=2998.9s)]
*  anti-dumping law [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3002.5600000000004s)]
*  to [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3004.34s)]
*  confront a variety of instances of what he's what the administration after careful economic analysis [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3005.52s)]
*  Saw as inappropriate subsidy [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3012.98s)]
*  I might or might not have thought that they were doing that in the right way [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3016.5800000000004s)]
*  But we wouldn't be having this argument [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3021.7000000000003s)]
*  the [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3024.5800000000004s)]
*  Front pages would not be about tariff policy day after day [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3025.46s)]
*  And the stock market would not be down by five trillion dollars [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3029.7000000000003s)]
*  the [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3033.54s)]
*  Central thing we are discussing [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3034.6400000000003s)]
*  Is not whether there are sensible modifications to trade policy to respond to bad practices in other countries [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3037.7000000000003s)]
*  Or to promote resilience [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3045.1400000000003s)]
*  Those are technical debates that frankly aren't that interesting to a large number of people [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3047.2999999999997s)]
*  The question [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3053.06s)]
*  Is whether declaring that we need a whole new era of u.s. Economic policy [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3054.58s)]
*  around [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3060.66s)]
*  Universal tariffs against everything [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3062.56s)]
*  Is so I think that that goes I hear you is a rational step forward [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3066.42s)]
*  Or and what I would say bilateral trade surpluses as a judge now [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3070.8199999999997s)]
*  We're talking about the montecarlo simulation of how to achieve the outcome and what I am saying is [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3075.62s)]
*  There is just as much as you and I want to guess [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3081.06s)]
*  The fundamental and honest answer is none of us know [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3084.58s)]
*  The people in the white house what they know [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3088.58s)]
*  They will share a little bit at a time because the reality is if you what you wanted was a white paper [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3091.38s)]
*  Or if what you wanted was paint by numbers [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3097.7799999999997s)]
*  I think back to david's point all that would do is just take any lovers that they had [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3100.5s)]
*  And give people the opportunity to shape their response and I think in traditional game theory [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3104.98s)]
*  And again [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3112.02s)]
*  In traditional game theory, I think the right thing to do is when you're playing poker you play street by street [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3113.62s)]
*  What's the flop? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3118.5s)]
*  Make a set of actions. What's the turn make a set of actions? What's the river make a set of actions? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3119.86s)]
*  And I think if you're going to play to win [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3124.58s)]
*  This is what they should do keep their cards very very close to the vest [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3127.06s)]
*  Realize that you can't necessarily surgically go and attack the lithium market first [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3131.54s)]
*  Then the rare earth market second because it all goes back to the same balance sheet [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3137.2200000000003s)]
*  It's the same actor over and over. I think there's a useful analogy to draw here [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3141.54s)]
*  I think a lot about [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3146.42s)]
*  An article mark daner wrote in the new yorker view of books many years ago about the iraq war [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3148.9s)]
*  And it's an article that is stuck in my mind forever because what he says about it is that [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3154.02s)]
*  One of the the difficulties of the politics of the iraq war is there was no one war [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3159.4599999999996s)]
*  There was everybody's private war that they were projecting on to the bush administration [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3165.14s)]
*  You have the liberal humanitarian vision of why we were going to war and what that war would look like [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3169.4599999999996s)]
*  You had a realist vision for it. You had a vision that was more about [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3173.7s)]
*  Weapons of mass destruction and keeping the homeland safe from terrorism. You had people believe there was an iraq al qaeda connection [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3178.1s)]
*  There were really dozens of these which is how you got as broad a coalition behind as bad a policy as that [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3183.78s)]
*  Together because everybody said [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3190.5s)]
*  You know, they're being a little bit vague about what's really going on here and why we're really doing this [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3192.6600000000003s)]
*  But I bet you if you go into their heart of hearts what they want [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3196.7400000000002s)]
*  Is the thing I want even though the policy doesn't quite match what policy you would get from starting from my premises [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3201.3s)]
*  And that's really what I hear here I hear it on this show [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3209.46s)]
*  But I hear it in general in the discussion around this that there are a lot of different objectives being projected onto donald trump and his trade war [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3212.98s)]
*  The objectives do not fit the policies we're seeing the objectives are not [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3221.78s)]
*  Stably articulated by donald trump or the people around him nor is any specific objective [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3226.1000000000004s)]
*  Being articulated in a stable way without contradicting objectives also being articulated at the same time [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3230.98s)]
*  And look maybe in the end and this is why I want to push you all on metrics [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3237.06s)]
*  You get something you like out of this, but you're giving away [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3240.82s)]
*  A lot of clarity just on the trust that what is happening is people are keeping a good hand of cards [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3244.58s)]
*  With a good strategy of poker hidden from you as opposed to what's happening is what we seem to be seeing in public [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3250.66s)]
*  Which is donald trump is a chaotic and erratic person [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3257.3s)]
*  They are making policy in a chaotic and erratic way that policy is having chaotic and erratic consequences [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3260.26s)]
*  And then they are operating and moving on the fly in chaotic and erratic fashion sax you heard ezra [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3266.3599999999997s)]
*  Say that they he feels this administration is being a bit chaotic in the approach here [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3272.7599999999998s)]
*  What's the counter to that you heard shaman say? Hey, this is a really thoughtful. They're holding their cards close to the chest [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3276.9199999999996s)]
*  Maybe you could clarify what your position is. Is this too chaotic or is this crazy? [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3281.9599999999996s)]
*  What i'm hearing is a bunch of process objections to trump's policy and i'm hearing a bunch of nitpicking [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3287.08s)]
*  What about lasutu or whatever? Okay? Look this is [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3292.2799999999997s)]
*  A very unrealistic view of politics when we've had a bipartisan consensus in washington for decades that unfettered free trade [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3295.72s)]
*  Is a good thing no matter how big our trade deficits got no matter how rich and powerful china got no matter [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3304.2799999999997s)]
*  How unfair the trade practices got no matter how many millions of our jobs and factories got exported overseas? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3309.64s)]
*  This has been the bipartisan consensus in washington and larry you're right that it started before the clinton administration and the george w bush [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3315.72s)]
*  Administration definitely accelerated it but there has absolutely been a bipartisan consensus in washington that this sort of unfettered free trade policy [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3323.4799999999996s)]
*  Was good for the country [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3331.4799999999996s)]
*  Now, how do you change that now? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3333.56s)]
*  Look, you can nitpick this and you can make all the process objections you want but donald trump has changed the conversation [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3335.56s)]
*  I just read my [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3341.8799999999997s)]
*  You keep saying i've offered a process objection when i'm objecting to the absence of your goals. Can I finish ezra you were pointing [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3344.12s)]
*  To donald trump's views when he was a public figure in the 1980s 1990s on trade as somehow he was wrong [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3351.16s)]
*  He was not wrong. He was one of the few people in the few public figures in america who was right about this [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3357.64s)]
*  I think most people today would say he was right about this [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3363.64s)]
*  That throwing open our markets to these to these foreign products without thinking about the consequences. It was a mistake [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3367.4s)]
*  You guys have me completely confused really you do. No, i'm confused about the incoherence of your position larry [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3374.6s)]
*  David you still believe that the clinton administration [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3380.8399999999997s)]
*  Let's call it a bipartisan consensus that era was correct while at the same time you're arguing that pntr didn't do anything [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3385.0s)]
*  I think it is really telling that you are so [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3391.16s)]
*  Much more loathe to defend what we are seeing than to attack what has been if you want to [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3393.72s)]
*  It's fine. Like I guess you could have it would be interesting to have you and to me [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3397.96s)]
*  They're the same thing if you be interested have you and larry go 12 rounds on the clinton era [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3401.08s)]
*  But you know when I say to you listen there is not a stable set of objectives that fit the policy here [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3406.12s)]
*  Can I answer that's a process? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3412.04s)]

*  And your very valid objectives. I hear david I can give you this [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3456.28s)]

*  Viscera in the heartland all the stuff and I just want to understand how we'll know [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3468.12s)]
*  Okay, whether we have fixed. Okay. Look, well, I can answer this too. Go ahead. Go ahead david. All right [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3472.76s)]
*  Look larry and ezra welcome to a political coalition [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3477.4s)]
*  Different people have different objectives just like different people had different objectives for the policy that we had in place 25 years ago [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3481.16s)]
*  Okay, there are some people who think that we should have an across the board 10 tariff to raise revenue because the country needs revenue [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3487.56s)]
*  And that that would be a better way to raise revenue than to say have income taxes or capital gains taxes [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3495.48s)]
*  Stan druckenmiller who's not a fan of tariffs? [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3500.04s)]
*  Nonetheless said that he would support a 10 tariff no more than 10 but up to 10 as a way to raise revenue [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3503.16s)]
*  Okay, that's his point of view. There are other people and I would say i'm more someone who thinks about the geopolitical consequences of this [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3510.12s)]
*  Who think it was a huge mistake [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3517.16s)]
*  to throw open our markets to chinese products [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3519.56s)]

*  To threaten the u.s world order one more time. Hold on. There's different people with different objectives one more time [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3529.16s)]
*  Because you're you are just not speaking truth [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3535.24s)]

*  one restriction [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3542.12s)]

*  You said seven times [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3551.64s)]
*  Throw open our market to chinese products [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3553.64s)]
*  I want to know one [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3556.9199999999996s)]
*  example [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3559.2999999999997s)]
*  In which the united states opened its market in 1999 or 2000 the point just one the point of pntr [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3560.68s)]
*  Well, can you name one product? Yes where restrictions were reduced? Okay, david name it [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3569.72s)]
*  Listen, you're mischaracterizing what pntr did we can play this like a grok game if you want people can go ahead and grok this question [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3575.0s)]
*  And they'll get this answer look the answer is that before pntr [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3581.24s)]
*  China was granted mfn on a year-by-year basis by congress, correct? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3585.48s)]
*  Pntr made it permanent. What does that do? It created a permanent new framework for trade relations between the united states and china [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3590.66s)]
*  So it created permanence and it created a certain expectation. What did that enable? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3598.04s)]
*  Massive investment [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3602.92s)]
*  by us companies in china [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3604.92s)]
*  So all the bean counters from mckenzie started talking about [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3607.6400000000003s)]
*  Outsourcing and just-in-time manufacturing they started moving the factories over there in a much greater way [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3611.78s)]
*  You know the mitt romney's and private equity hold on a second. We finished the mitt romney's and private equity said [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3617.88s)]
*  This is a great idea. Let's move all of our manufacturing [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3623.2400000000002s)]
*  Could we agree that whether or not it was the wtl hold on the bankers on wall street got to financialize and securitize [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3626.0400000000004s)]
*  All sorts of new products. Okay [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3631.9s)]
*  That was the result of pntr [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3634.46s)]
*  The thing we have to decide really right now as a country is if the thing that you all are trying to replace this with [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3636.62s)]
*  Is better right if it will work and so I want to go back to what you said a minute ago david [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3642.54s)]
*  When you're like welcome to political coalitions [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3646.2999999999997s)]
*  Larry has been in politics a long time. He was treasury secretary. I've covered politics for a long time. I'm [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3648.94s)]
*  Familiar with political coalitions [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3653.56s)]
*  In fact, a lot of my book is currently about the problems in the way the democratic coalition [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3654.94s)]
*  With too many objectives all at once [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3659.84s)]
*  Can end up destroying the ability of the policy to actually achieve a clear goal [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3662.4s)]
*  So this is this is precisely the non-procedural objection [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3667.28s)]
*  I am bringing here. This is why I think it is dangerous to be treating an upheaval of the entire global financial system [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3672.0800000000004s)]
*  Without a clearly defined objective that is connected to a policy and so the the question is [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3679.52s)]
*  If the idea is that there are all these different players here [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3685.52s)]
*  Who have all these different policy objectives that would connect to all these different policies and everybody's getting a little bit of them [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3688.8799999999997s)]
*  And trump is kind of flipping back and forth through different versions of them [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3695.04s)]
*  You could end up despite yes, whatever mistakes were made in the free trade consensus, which I do agree that we had [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3698.72s)]
*  You could end up with a bad and next not even consensus. Just a bad next policy [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3704.64s)]
*  A unclear coalition that is fighting with itself and is making policy without a strong process can create not like nitpicky [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3710.2400000000002s)]
*  procedural problems but actual damage and disasters [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3717.26s)]
*  Chamath, let's look let's try to look forward here. This obviously has been a [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3721.44s)]
*  cataclysmic chaotic [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3726.94s)]
*  Intense whatever descriptor you want to use of the past week productive is [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3728.96s)]
*  Okay, sure [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3733.84s)]
*  And it certainly created massive swings in the market is this all going to cause a recession is this too [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3735.2s)]
*  violent of an approach to markets that is I think a valid [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3742.64s)]
*  Criticism that people have including, you know, the majority of business leaders are saying hey, I think I have to start layoffs [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3748.14s)]
*  You had united airlines say we're not going to give any guidance this feels [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3754.64s)]
*  Two business leaders republican business leaders primarily and market participants [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3758.96s)]
*  As just far too chaotic and they can't plan [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3764.66s)]
*  And if they can't plan then they stop planning which then is going to cause layoffs [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3768.74s)]
*  It's going to cause bankruptcies and who knows what the second and third order consequences are going to be [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3773.06s)]
*  So what's going to happen here over the next couple of weeks and months? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3778.74s)]
*  So just on the recession question and I'd like to give an answer to esra and larry [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3781.62s)]
*  I think that and i've said this for about a year. It was clear to me that we were sneakily [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3786.1s)]
*  In a recession before [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3792.6s)]
*  and the reason was [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3794.3599999999997s)]
*  the vast amounts of money [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3795.9599999999996s)]
*  and deficits that were being pumped into [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3798.4399999999996s)]
*  government services that perverted the actual gdp picture in america [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3801.24s)]
*  so as doge sort of slows down that money flow [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3806.3599999999997s)]
*  and as [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3811.08s)]
*  the [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3813.0s)]
*  Consensus in congress gets to a better budget [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3814.18s)]
*  I think that you're going to see that the government was probably responsible for 100 to 150 basis points of just waste [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3818.2000000000003s)]
*  And if you take that out [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3825.08s)]
*  You will technically be in a recession [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3827.2400000000002s)]
*  That was independent of these tariffs and I think that that's where the true economy jason was [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3829.56s)]
*  And I think that we're going to just find that out. So [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3835.4s)]
*  That's that on where we go from here [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3838.84s)]
*  I can give you an anecdote and i'll give you a projection the anecdote is this weekend [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3841.7200000000003s)]
*  My wife and I were in bed and a person called me [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3845.24s)]
*  Very successful businessman who was representing the president of a country saying hey chmoth. I need some advice. What do we do here? [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3848.3599999999997s)]
*  And we walked through the three things that he and his government that they government were trying to figure out because they [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3855.7999999999997s)]
*  wanted an off-ramp they were like [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3862.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm ready to cry uncle [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3865.16s)]
*  We're ready to tap out [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3867.08s)]
*  And again, he was calling me as a private citizen, but I think this conversation was very instructive number one [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3869.0s)]
*  He's like look we have these really high tariffs on inbound american products. We're happy to cut these things to zero [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3873.32s)]
*  And I said well you should do that [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3879.7200000000003s)]
*  second [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3881.56s)]
*  While we were exploring he's like, yeah, you know, we have an enormous capital purchase with airbus. I said cancel it [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3882.84s)]
*  Swap it to boeing. He's like done [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3888.52s)]
*  And then the third which was interesting is he's like we need to import [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3891.1600000000003s)]
*  An enormous amount of energy [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3895.1600000000003s)]
*  And I said well, who do you give that concession to right now? [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3897.56s)]
*  And it was a non-american company and I said well, why wouldn't you just rfp that to an american business and let them compete? [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3900.2s)]
*  And he's like we'd be open to that as well [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3907.3199999999997s)]
*  So he said, you know, we're getting prepared [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3910.52s)]
*  We want to find a way to talk to the trump administration and i'm like great [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3912.52s)]
*  However, I can be helpful. I'm help. I'll be helpful to you. I got off the phone. I looked at my wife and I said [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3915.72s)]
*  If even 30 of these 75 countries do a deal anywhere remotely close to this [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3920.52s)]
*  This was an enormous win. So let me tell you [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3926.4399999999996s)]
*  So let me give you my projection jason of what the art of the deal could be here [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3929.7200000000003s)]
*  What you do is you can rewrite bretton woods 2.0. What was bretton woods 1.0? [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3934.04s)]
*  It was fixing exchange rates. It was setting up the imf. It was setting up the world bank [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3939.0800000000004s)]
*  Those were the conditions on the ground post world war ii. It made a lot of sense [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3943.7200000000003s)]
*  What would we do if we had to write the marlago accords right now? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3946.84s)]
*  I think what we would do is work backwards from the question that ezra asked and the answer that I gave [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3951.0800000000004s)]
*  How do we create resiliency? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3956.76s)]
*  In these critical markets number one a framework for that number two is how do we create limits? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3959.0800000000004s)]
*  for government sponsored intervention [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3965.6400000000003s)]

*  So that we can actually compete on a level playing field and then number three [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3973.5600000000004s)]
*  Very simply if you can do business in my country [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3977.32s)]
*  Why can I not do business in yours and i'll just give you that story for one second [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3980.36s)]
*  I was responsible. I was the head [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3983.8799999999997s)]
*  Of every single entity of facebook outside of the united states. I opened every market [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3986.3599999999997s)]
*  my team and I [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3991.64s)]
*  Created a framework for dominating [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3993.08s)]
*  I figured we figured out how to crack brazil india russia [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3996.12s)]
*  You know the one market that we never could ever make a single iota of progress say it jason with me [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=3999.9599999999996s)]
*  Well china china china russia iran everyone in russia [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4006.6s)]
*  So my point is in every single market except one is it that we were just lucky in [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4011.64s)]
*  174 markets and one we were stupid no [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4017.54s)]
*  So I think that the moral log of accords this sort of bretton woods 2.0 is the outcome ezra [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4020.6800000000003s)]
*  It will basically use tariffs as a way to get these governments to a table and allow us to negotiate a much [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4025.48s)]
*  Fairer economic quid pro quo here's my concern with this theory [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4033.48s)]
*  I want to leave out but i'll leave the sort of question of what the real economy looked like to larry this world [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4037.4s)]
*  In which what is happening is a business leader who represents a country is calling you and saying okay [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4043.4s)]
*  What do we need to do to deal right? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4047.48s)]
*  They're coming to donald trump and they are going to come to donald trump as larry said earlier. There's no doubt [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4049.08s)]
*  That the u.s economic leverage is enormous [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4053.64s)]
*  And virtually every country [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4057.0s)]
*  Faced with our might is going to try to cut a deal with us [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4059.4s)]
*  But then there's a call they're not making to you that they're making to someone else which is [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4063.0800000000004s)]
*  We have [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4069.48s)]
*  Allowed [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4071.6400000000003s)]
*  Or we have approached the u.s as a functionally benign partner for a very long time [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4072.92s)]
*  And now they're becoming a dangerous partner [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4078.6800000000003s)]
*  They are very very strong [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4081.2400000000002s)]
*  And they will use that strength to crush countries smaller than them when it suits the whims [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4083.48s)]
*  of a personalist regime [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4089.5600000000004s)]
*  run by a person [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4091.88s)]
*  Who his feelings even about people that the u.s or countries in u.s traditionally considered allies like canada or much of europe? [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4093.56s)]
*  uh change [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4101.32s)]
*  And so yes on the one hand for the next year or two we want to avoid [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4102.5199999999995s)]
*  Getting a big tariff slapped on us and so we got to figure out what is it that if we offer it to donald trump [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4107.08s)]
*  He will say to himself [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4113.08s)]
*  That was enough [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4114.76s)]
*  Of a give that you know, I can move on to someone else I can make them the the focus of my ire [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4116.52s)]
*  And on the other hand they're going to begin to build fortresses and deals and partnerships and approaches [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4123.080000000001s)]
*  Then make sure they are less exposed to our ability to wield this power against them in the future [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4128.68s)]
*  but before I came on the show I had gone on x and I saw [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4134.68s)]
*  A clip of you going around where you're saying that one of the problems with the biden administration [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4138.68s)]
*  Was that you couldn't get anybody on the phone and in the trump administration you make the call the deputy chief of staff picks up [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4142.6s)]
*  You say hey, I need you to talk to to this company. They I work with them [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4148.2s)]
*  They're freaking out about the tariffs the deputy chief of staff kills the company. They work something out [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4151.64s)]
*  No, no, not that they work something out. They listen they listen [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4155.96s)]
*  this this world in which we are doing the deal making by [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4159.4s)]
*  Individual relationships by who can get their calls answered not by rules that feel clear and stable. That's all [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4164.92s)]
*  That's all the [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4170.679999999999s)]
*  Administration [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4173.08s)]
*  That's not what I said [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4175.5599999999995s)]
*  You're trying to make it sound like corruption [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4177.719999999999s)]
*  Hold on. I I I will I will George Clooney that was making the call who cares what George Clooney thinks [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4179.8s)]
*  Didn't you just say on uh, well, I was very very critical of biden [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4185.16s)]
*  I saw that clip as right what you must [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4189.16s)]
*  Is simply that the white house listens they listen calls whereas he couldn't get his calls returned [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4193.639999999999s)]
*  By the obama administration great. I think we're actually not saying something all that [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4199.24s)]
*  You made it sound like corruption. Well, I actually do think what trump is working through [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4204.12s)]
*  Is deal by deal patronage based on how he sees the company. I'm sorry the other country that's not what happened [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4209.56s)]
*  Ezra, can I just make sure that this is clear? Yes, this is a 150 year old [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4216.92s)]
*  American business. I have no interest in that company except a friendship [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4221.38s)]
*  These are americans hiring americans trying to compete with china who were very negatively affected and all I said was why [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4226.4400000000005s)]
*  Don't you have a chance to explain what's happening on the ground my point that I was trying to make and maybe I didn't make [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4233.0s)]
*  It clear enough. So let me set the record straight [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4238.200000000001s)]
*  The trump administration what I have seen as a businessman [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4240.200000000001s)]
*  Is willing to hear the conditions on the ground as a businessman when I was building asra just to be clear [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4243.88s)]
*  critical rare earth supplies for america under the biden administration [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4250.04s)]
*  Battery can materials to compete with china under the biden administration [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4254.46s)]
*  Ai chips to be the best inference solution under the biden administration. I couldn't get a call back [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4259.179999999999s)]
*  That's just the facts [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4265.5s)]
*  Not because I wanted anything just to tell them what was going on [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4267.34s)]
*  So fair enough. Okay fair enough [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4272.139999999999s)]
*  I I am not telling you that the biden administration should have returned your calls [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4275.42s)]
*  What I am saying is that the degree to which trump first [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4279.259999999999s)]
*  And then everybody around him as an example of him because culture comes from the top [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4284.46s)]
*  Is working off this kind of individual call and deal making worries me because I believe that you had every one of these calls [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4288.62s)]
*  You're saying and they went exactly the way you say they went [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4295.82s)]
*  And then the calls that you are not getting and they are minutes ago as you are saying that a 10 across the board [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4298.86s)]
*  Tariff was too broad and we need to go industry by industry and now you're saying that it's going to be too particular [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4305.26s)]
*  And he shouldn't do country by country negotiations deal making listening to people [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4311.74s)]
*  Listening to people is not deal making asra. It's just listening to people [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4316.3s)]
*  Are you really going to be there and tell me that the way trump himself works is not individual deal making [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4319.58s)]
*  Here's what i've seen with eric adams [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4326.22s)]
*  Is this really is this really the argument here? I will tell you what i've seen and david's seen much more [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4329.9800000000005s)]
*  What I have seen from the president is he takes in [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4336.06s)]
*  Hundreds of opinions and starts to figure out what the ground truth is and the reason is when you only listen to one or two [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4339.5s)]
*  Every president probably deals with this you have this information asymmetry problem because you are the president of the united states [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4346.9400000000005s)]
*  And so how do you cut through it? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4353.820000000001s)]
*  You talk to hundreds and hundreds of people and you triangulate what the truth is [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4355.42s)]
*  So it's not like he's giving any favor. He's collecting information. That is a good process you want [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4359.42s)]
*  The most powerful person in the world to get to the ground truth. Go ahead larry [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4365.26s)]
*  I am all for information gathering [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4370.860000000001s)]
*  I agree that the biden administration [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4374.22s)]
*  Did not do as good a job as it could have of maintaining relations with the business community [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4377.9800000000005s)]
*  I agree that it's a good idea [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4384.3s)]
*  For there to be quite extensive connection [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4386.860000000001s)]
*  I am also appalled [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4390.38s)]
*  By the half dozen phone calls I have gotten from prominent people in business who have said [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4392.78s)]
*  I'm used to being shaken down [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4400.62s)]
*  When I try to do business in some parts of the world [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4403.26s)]
*  It's a new experience [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4407.1s)]
*  To be shaken down by representatives of the president of the united states. What's the shape down when you have? [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4409.02s)]
*  Close connections you help us you contribute this way [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4416.78s)]
*  That makes no sense at all makes no sense what the president has been trying to do is encourage [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4420.7s)]
*  Maybe it is an erroneous perception to which I have been exposed [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4428.06s)]
*  Repeatedly, but it is a but it is a pervasive [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4433.4800000000005s)]
*  Total nonsense you guys are very confident that your anecdotes are true and everybody else's aren't it is a perception [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4437.9800000000005s)]
*  that is shared [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4444.38s)]
*  by [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4446.06s)]
*  Almost everyone who has experience in the conflict of interest area [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4446.86s)]
*  Who has looked at the situation? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4451.74s)]
*  of [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4455.099999999999s)]
*  Trump administration officials [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4455.9s)]
*  And those working as special government employees in the trump administration. What are you saying? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4458.299999999999s)]
*  So I just went through that whole process larry. What does that mean? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4463.74s)]
*  But I can speak to this because I just went through this process it took forever took like months [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4468.38s)]
*  Okay, I went through the same process everyone else goes through the oge career staff have to go through all of your [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4473.259999999999s)]
*  Disclosures and they figure out what the conflicts are and then you have to divest them [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4479.48s)]
*  Okay, it's the same process everyone goes through so you're all over the place making all sorts of accusations here [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4483.82s)]
*  So if you have some proof or you want to accuse someone then why don't you just do it? [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4489.58s)]
*  But otherwise what you're saying is just not true. It's not backed up by anything great. They shut down eric adams [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4493.74s)]
*  That's my that's a direct accusation that happened in public [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4498.7s)]
*  They should down eric they shook down eric adams because he can put him in his pocket [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4501.1s)]
*  I don't know that's a big deal y'all like that is the way they are doing business here [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4504.780000000001s)]
*  You guys are all over the map making wild accusations first. It was there [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4509.18s)]
*  a second two seconds ago resignations [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4514.780000000001s)]
*  Because of their discomfort with being overruled [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4517.820000000001s)]
*  By your colleagues in the trump administration [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4522.38s)]
*  So the suggestion all over the map five seconds ago the same ethical standards that I was held [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4526.16s)]
*  And that other members of previous administrations including the bush administration were held [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4532.48s)]
*  Unfortunately is not right. Well, that's that's false [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4539.099999999999s)]
*  All right. Well, there's two issues here. You may not be familiar with my situation, but I had to divest [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4543.2s)]
*  Hold on. I had to divest a lot as I talked about in the show [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4547.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, in any event you guys are all over the map making wild accusations two seconds ago [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4550.639999999999s)]
*  The shakedown was at the level of companies then all of a sudden it was ogen ethics [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4555.12s)]
*  Then it was something about eric adams integrated [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4559.28s)]
*  It's nobody's making I like that. You're like who's eric adams. We're not making no [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4562.639999999999s)]
*  I know eric adams says I supported him on this show [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4566.16s)]
*  I know he is a straightforward way that trump does business at every level at which he operates and so it is happening [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4569.04s)]
*  At can I give you my personal experience? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4574.799999999999s)]
*  I know you don't want to hear it, but I don't it's not that I it's not that I don't want to hear it [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4577.12s)]
*  You know how it started. I don't want to hear it. You know how this started is because [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4580.96s)]
*  Hold on a second. Ezra you misquoted something. Chima said on another podcast where all he said was that I can get my phone [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4585.2s)]
*  Calls returned by this white house where I couldn't with obama or biden even though I was a big donor. Hold on [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4591.84s)]
*  And you guys have somehow morphed that into some sort of like broad ranging accusations of corruption or something like that [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4597.68s)]
*  What you have no evidence no clear about what the [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4604.64s)]
*  Accusation of the way donald trump works is [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4608.06s)]
*  Ezra your accusation of me tried to infer some form of corruption or some form of deal making none of that happened what I [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4610.96s)]
*  What I again i'll tell you I connected the white house so they could hear on the ground [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4616.72s)]
*  What's happening from a company who is very negatively impacted by the tariff so that they had the complexion of that feedback as well [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4621.200000000001s)]
*  Okay [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4628.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you deny the possibility that your experience with the trump administration might be different than people who they feel are less allied to them [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4628.8s)]
*  Than you are Ezra. I'm willing i'm willing to it's a straightforward question [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4634.4s)]
*  What are you sure that you're a good sample? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4638.32s)]
*  I don't even know what we're talking about anymore [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4641.2s)]
*  All I think what we're talking about right now is that people who donate to politicians have unique access to politicians [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4643.2s)]
*  I think we can all agree that that's not true. That was not the point. Okay, just to be very clear [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4649.599999999999s)]
*  I give I have given way more to the democrats [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4652.5599999999995s)]
*  Than i've given to donald trump and you were disappointed about that. I didn't say anything about your donations [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4656.0s)]
*  I said about where your allied now and by the way, like what's crazy is I was the same intellectual person [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4660.5599999999995s)]
*  I was under biden that I am under trump. It's just that it seems like the trump administration is like [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4665.759999999999s)]
*  Well, this is a smart guy with some opinions. Let me listen biden [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4670.5599999999995s)]
*  And by the way and larry you and you know this these are some very close friends of ours that we share mutually [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4673.599999999999s)]
*  That would not even return my calls [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4679.5199999999995s)]
*  So it is a little personal for me as well as right just to be honest with you [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4681.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm not going to go there. But the point is that's fair. I have never I have never seen [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4684.48s)]
*  A single iota of any form of anything other than just gathering information from the trump [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4689.120000000001s)]
*  They've never asked me for anything. They've never tried to direct me to do anything [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4696.0s)]
*  They just want to know what's going on when you ask them. Hey, can you talk to such and such a person? [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4699.6s)]
*  That your experience [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4704.56s)]
*  is not the experience [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4706.400000000001s)]
*  of [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4708.400000000001s)]
*  Quite a number of the nation's major law firms [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4709.280000000001s)]
*  It is not the experience of quite a number of the nation's business leaders [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4712.56s)]
*  It is not the experience of quite a number of [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4717.04s)]
*  The nation's universities [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4722.16s)]
*  that [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4725.44s)]
*  I am neither the first [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4727.04s)]
*  nor the hundredth [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4728.96s)]
*  person [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4731.12s)]
*  Referencing efforts at extortion to use the movie the godfather [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4732.299999999999s)]
*  as a metaphor for the four aspects of the way in which our country is [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4737.04s)]
*  being [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4743.759999999999s)]
*  Governed what a surprise democratic universities and democratic law firms are making accusations [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4744.96s)]
*  All right, let's move on. We think we've seen the tariff issue [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4750.96s)]
*  And I think we can all agree that if you donate money, you might have better access to politicians [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4754.16s)]
*  I want to talk about the future especially jason if you give 10 to the big guy then you really get access [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4759.12s)]
*  Remember that we could do these allegations all day long if you you know, yeah [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4763.92s)]
*  There's a long list of people who've made donations and there's a long list of favorable things that have happened to them after [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4768.88s)]
*  across all administrations [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4774.16s)]
*  and [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4776.16s)]
*  We can debate cause and correlation all day long here [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4776.96s)]
*  But I wanted to talk about the future of the democratic party while we're here ezra you are been on a tour [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4779.68s)]
*  talking about [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4786.24s)]
*  exactly [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4787.92s)]
*  How incompetent how terrible of a campaign they ran what is the future and i'll let larry get you know [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4790.56s)]
*  His uh his two cents in here as well [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4796.96s)]
*  Is there any saving this party and if so, what would it look like? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4799.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, there's a the problem of the party in the campaign [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4803.2s)]
*  Let me bracket that because so my book abundance is more about how democrats govern at both the state and and local and federal level [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4805.6s)]
*  And some of the pathologies of governance there that make it hard for for liberals to achieve their goals [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4812.16s)]
*  There are versions of this on the right, but i'm not really writing about that in in this [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4817.04s)]
*  So my book abundance derrick thompson is about the tendency democrats have [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4821.2s)]
*  To subsidize things where they are choking off the supply of the thing they want people to have more of [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4825.52s)]
*  So think about housing in california you get rental vouchers from the federal government [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4830.799999999999s)]
*  But we make it incredibly hard to build homes clean energy [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4834.0s)]
*  Which a lot of the biden administration's policies were about putting huge subsidies behind the building of more clean energy [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4837.28s)]
*  But they didn't really do anything to make the permitting the siting the state capacity to do all of that [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4843.5199999999995s)]
*  Uh capable of building that amount of clean energy at the pace [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4849.839999999999s)]
*  They foresaw us building it right that they wanted us to build it [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4854.48s)]
*  And behind this and and I can sort of go into a lot of detail here [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4858.0s)]
*  But it's a diminishment of state capacity that comes from wrapping the state itself [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4861.759999999999s)]
*  In red tape and regulation. I think we think and have an intuitive way of thinking [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4867.2s)]
*  About the idea of deregulation on the private sector, right? [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4871.839999999999s)]
*  When the government is imposing regulations on private companies and it's making it hard for those companies to act to do business, etc [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4874.879999999999s)]
*  But this happens first and foremost on the government itself [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4881.759999999999s)]
*  One of my favorite examples i've been using lately [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4885.04s)]
*  There's a new rand report that looks at how much it costs to construct a square foot of housing in california [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4887.36s)]
*  In texas in colorado and it does it on two kinds of housing market rate and it does it on affordable housing [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4894.16s)]
*  subsidized by the public sector [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4900.86s)]
*  And the cost of creating housing california market rate is 2x in california what it is in texas [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4902.88s)]
*  But when you get into that publicly subsidized housing [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4908.88s)]
*  Where you have all these new standards and rules and regulations being triggered by the addition of public money [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4912.08s)]
*  It goes up to about 4.4 x and so you have this real problem [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4918.320000000001s)]
*  I think in a way of governing that evolved in the 70s the 80s [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4922.88s)]
*  There's a kind of small government version of the democratic party the new left more individualistic [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4927.280000000001s)]
*  That was worried about too much exercise of government power [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4932.400000000001s)]
*  And now that we are in a different world with different problems [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4936.56s)]
*  We're thinking about reindustrializing we have a housing shortage [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4940.0s)]
*  And you have things like the biden administration which really are thinking about how to build a lot more in america [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4943.28s)]
*  But you don't have either a policy architecture or I would say a governing culture [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4947.76s)]
*  That makes that possible. Yeah, and and so a lot of this came from france's fukuyama. I think uh and [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4953.36s)]
*  Votocracy, how do you pronounce this? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4960.14s)]
*  Fukuyama is a great sort of related concept of vetocracy, which is the vetocracy [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4962.64s)]
*  But you also got another great concept since we're bringing up fukuyama, which is that neoliberalism [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4966.32s)]
*  Which you've sort of been talking about here with the wt and other things [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4970.32s)]
*  He says people think about it as the veneration of the market [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4973.44s)]
*  But what it is first and foremost is the degradation of the state [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4976.639999999999s)]
*  And I think that explains a lot more about the world we're in than people recognize [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4979.92s)]
*  You can agree with this frances fukuyama is probably one of the most polarizing modern [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4983.599999999999s)]
*  academics [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4988.0599999999995s)]
*  As you read and people end up in they're very pro fukuyama or they think fukuyama is insane [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4989.84s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look because because what happened is I mean just to uplevel this for a second is that you you had fukuyama [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4994.879999999999s)]
*  right the end of history which basically said that democratic capitalism is the end i'll be all and we're basically down to one system and [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=4999.839999999999s)]
*  The whole world's going to run on that system [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5006.719999999999s)]
*  And that philosophy then animated I would say a neoliberal and neoconservative consensus [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5009.12s)]
*  In washington for 25 years and there were three key pillars of that. Let's call it globalist consensus [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5016.32s)]
*  Number one we'd have open borders free flow of labor. In fact, the wall street journal editorial page [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5022.0s)]
*  Which you know is considered to be conservative actually supported a constitutional amendment saying that we'd have open borders [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5028.160000000001s)]
*  Number two, we'd have open flows of trade and capital [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5034.400000000001s)]
*  So basically the unfettered free trade agenda and then number three the third leg of it was pax americana [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5037.52s)]
*  We deploy american troops all over the world to defend this consensus because they'd be greeted as liberators not occupiers [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5043.52s)]
*  I think all three pillars [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5050.8s)]
*  Have been refuted [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5053.04s)]
*  and the the person who has represented the shift in this consensus to i'd say a new agenda of [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5054.72s)]
*  economic nationalism [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5062.64s)]
*  And geopolitical nationalism is donald trump. Okay. Wow, I was gonna guess that [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5064.32s)]
*  Listen when you have [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5070.56s)]
*  End of history and the last man is a much more complicated [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5074.72s)]
*  Let me finish the point here because i'm kind of on a roll here. Yeah, keep wrapping bring it home when you have a bipartisan consensus [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5077.36s)]
*  that [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5086.48s)]
*  Included both bush republicans and clinton democrats around these three pillars of globalism [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5087.44s)]
*  And then i'd say that country turns against that [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5093.92s)]
*  That's not going to be a smooth process that is going to be potentially a violent process. It's going to be a disruptive process [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5097.12s)]
*  And you guys want to raise like all these nippy objections and prost or whatever [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5104.320000000001s)]
*  Donald trump is bringing that realignment. Well, the real question the real question is [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5108.320000000001s)]
*  Was that consensus correct or was it a failure? I would argue as a failure larry [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5113.92s)]
*  Let me ask you a question then when you see something like doge happening and people start taking a bit of a a more [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5118.240000000001s)]
*  unilateral a quicker a less veto [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5124.700000000001s)]
*  Based approach is that encouraging to you larry? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5127.6s)]
*  Do you think that's the right way to do it because we haven't been able to get the government smaller since clinton? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5130.8s)]
*  So are you pro-doge not doge and do you think this sort of objection to hey, we're going too fast too violently [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5136.56s)]
*  Maybe that's what we need to do at times and then i'll go back to you as to answer the same question [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5143.4400000000005s)]
*  I think that ezra is broadly right [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5147.52s)]
*  about the [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5151.2s)]
*  promiscuous distribution of the veto power [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5152.88s)]
*  He's broadly right that we need to be able to do more things [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5155.52s)]
*  more quickly [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5160.08s)]
*  In the state if we're to be an effective government [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5161.68s)]
*  I think we need much more [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5165.76s)]
*  Reform. I think democrats have allowed themselves [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5168.06s)]
*  excessively to become [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5173.1s)]
*  hostage to [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5175.18s)]

*  in important ways with an american mainstream [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5185.28s)]
*  And I think that in so far as the election outcomes in recent years have not been what they wanted [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5189.2s)]
*  That is an important contribution [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5195.76s)]
*  To how that has happened and I agree with david that donald trump [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5198.08s)]
*  represents a transformative [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5204.38s)]
*  and profoundly different ideology [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5206.88s)]

*  In governing america before [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5211.68s)]
*  I do believe that it is [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5214.8s)]
*  fundamentally [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5218.780000000001s)]

*  Of that approach [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5240.56s)]

*  Particularly when they have galvanizing personalities [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5244.64s)]

*  For a substantial period of time [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5250.56s)]

*  best judgment [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5262.400000000001s)]
*  Is that this project? [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5264.320000000001s)]
*  is [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5267.52s)]

*  and issues [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5279.44s)]
*  Of course, this should be much more aggressive [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5281.36s)]
*  Reform of the government than there is [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5283.98s)]
*  But that does not [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5287.84s)]
*  Excuse [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5290.3s)]
*  Or mean that it is likely to work out well [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5292.0s)]
*  for some [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5296.88s)]
*  Of the mindless savagery [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5298.96s)]
*  That the doze is bringing [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5301.6s)]
*  To traditional american institutions [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5304.56s)]
*  Is going to work out well and to take just one example [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5307.84s)]
*  My belief [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5313.28s)]
*  Is that the revenue loss? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5315.04s)]
*  From the doze's destruction [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5318.400000000001s)]
*  of [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5322.08s)]
*  Significant part of the functioning of our nation's tax collection system [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5323.92s)]
*  Is likely to exceed [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5329.12s)]
*  In terms of contributing more to the deficit [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5331.52s)]
*  than [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5335.04s)]
*  Any savings that is successfully realized what do you mean by that? [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5336.08s)]
*  What is they've identified the right thing but they're executing on it too much. Go ahead. No, no, no [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5340.32s)]
*  I have two questions larry just tactically. What do you mean by the destruction of the revenue collecting mechanism? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5345.12s)]
*  That's question number one, which was just I just want to understand what you meant higher but second question, which is more broadly [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5350.08s)]
*  If larry if you were president for a day just give us the [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5356.400000000001s)]
*  Larry summer's plan like what is the counterfactual to what's happening now? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5360.56s)]
*  You can include tariffs. You can include doge. I just want to understand how you would frame [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5365.68s)]
*  The solution to what ails us [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5371.280000000001s)]
*  So maybe tactically just talk about the the collections part because you referenced it and then just more strategically [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5373.84s)]
*  What the larry summer's 2.0 plan is? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5380.400000000001s)]
*  we are [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5383.360000000001s)]
*  firing on mass [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5384.56s)]
*  People whose job it is to audit people like you [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5387.200000000001s)]
*  and [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5391.84s)]
*  The results of that [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5392.72s)]
*  Is that we are losing revenue directly [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5394.64s)]
*  We are losing revenue further because people once audited go straight in subsequent years [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5398.88s)]
*  And we are losing revenue because more and more people are playing the audit lottery [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5406.0s)]
*  engaging in problematic practices [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5410.8s)]
*  In the expectation can I burst your bubble on this that they will not? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5413.76s)]
*  That they will not be caught. Let me tell you my experience. I get audited every year automatically [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5418.56s)]
*  And the reason you get audited every single year is typically the way that you acquire your wealth [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5424.400000000001s)]
*  creates complexity [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5429.52s)]
*  700 800 900 page [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5431.58s)]
*  tax filings [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5434.64s)]
*  Now you don't do that yourself. What happens is you typically pay a large big four accounting firm millions of dollars to do it [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5435.92s)]
*  Deloitte [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5442.24s)]
*  pwc anderson, etc [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5443.84s)]
*  Every year that i've been audited the biggest delta has been about a thousand bucks [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5447.04s)]
*  In this case, I actually was owed a thousand by the u.s. Government last year, which was what you spend it on incredible [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5452.8s)]
*  I'll spend it everywhere. So larry just so you know [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5458.56s)]
*  I'm well aware of everything you just said and I have no doubt about your personal integrity [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5462.0s)]
*  Factually you think it is less than a quarter of people with incomes over 10 million dollars are audited [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5467.44s)]
*  So it's just it's just not true. Let me ask everybody [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5474.8s)]
*  It's not true that everybody is uh that everybody is audited. I get the sense larry your you like doge [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5478.8s)]
*  But you don't like the execution got it [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5485.68s)]
*  Ezra you talk about your book. We got to move faster. We got to do things faster [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5487.84s)]
*  We got to take more risk [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5492.0s)]
*  So are you pro doge or not? And if you look at the democratic if you look at this administration [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5493.2s)]
*  I'm going to call it trump 2.0 for clarity [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5498.64s)]
*  These are I would say two out of three people around trump whether it's chamath joe rogan [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5501.2s)]
*  Besant howard [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5507.84s)]
*  even uh [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5510.32s)]
*  Trump himself are clinton democrats. I thought you were going to say you were going to say yourself [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5511.52s)]
*  I don't matter [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5517.76s)]
*  Ezra are you happy about doge your book seems to be a plan to do doge like things [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5518.96s)]
*  I think building state capacity is two dimensions. One is what the state can do [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5526.8s)]
*  And the second is the rules under which it doesn't [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5531.76s)]
*  Doge seems to me to be fundamentally destructive of state capacity [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5534.56s)]
*  first and this goes again to my [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5538.64s)]
*  Endless frustration that I feel like goals are not clearly laid out in the trump administration [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5540.8s)]
*  What are the measures we are looking at and how will they achieve them is it just trying to save a trillion dollars [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5544.96s)]
*  They've been very is that but that's not efficiency, right? I could save a trillion dollars [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5549.28s)]
*  No, I could save a trillion dollars in ways that will make the [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5553.44s)]
*  Let's put it this way what larry was just saying right if you cut everybody at the irs [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5557.28s)]
*  Right just cut every single one of them [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5562.24s)]
*  On the doge measure of how much did you save in headcount? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5564.639999999999s)]
*  That will look like it counted up towards your save a trillion dollars goal [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5567.92s)]
*  But in terms of what larry is saying which is the long-term efficiency of u.s [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5571.759999999999s)]
*  Tax collections you would have just made the irs much much much less efficient. We get that but they've also cut all these [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5575.28s)]
*  Software and consulting nonsense there is some stuff. I am not going to tell you that there are zero doge cuts that made sense [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5582.48s)]
*  But I am going to say that what I see them doing overall is highly destructive state capacity or similarly a lot of things happening [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5590.32s)]
*  Around usaid and say pepfar funding [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5596.0s)]
*  Um is pepfar efficient? I mean, yes you save money by not giving [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5598.48s)]
*  HIV retrovirals to children in africa, but I think it is good that you do that, right? [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5603.2s)]
*  So that's not the kind of efficiency i'm looking for. I am interested [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5607.76s)]
*  In state capacity that is connected to achieving specific goals [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5612.0s)]
*  I've talked to a bunch of people around doge and again here you get a lot of different ideas of what the goals are [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5616.56s)]
*  Some people say well what we're trying to do is save money [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5621.2s)]
*  But if what you wanted to do is save money you could say [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5623.84s)]
*  Go to congress and do a very big bill [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5626.64s)]
*  There was a lot of interest in congress people like rocana who wanted to work with doge [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5628.96s)]
*  To identify big spending cuts that both sides could agree on defense being a big being a big piece of this [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5633.84s)]
*  And then they decided not to do it. So doge to me [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5639.120000000001s)]
*  uh is a it would be great if somebody tried it, but I see this as much more of a [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5642.080000000001s)]

*  Appreciate you coming on the pod. Thank you. Thank you [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5794.32s)]
*  Spicy spicy episode here sax you wanted a chance to respond on the doge issue as as we wrap [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5797.44s)]
*  Wow. Well, yeah, I mean pretty productive episode. Yeah, let me um [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5805.2s)]
*  Let me partially agree with azura here. I mean, I think that uh, he's trying to introduce this idea of an abundance agenda to the democrat party [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5808.88s)]
*  I think that's a good thing. You know, I know you've talked about [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5815.68s)]
*  permitting reform and [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5819.120000000001s)]
*  Not tying up projects and so many hoops and so much environmental regulation and you know [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5820.96s)]
*  Even dei and all this kind of stuff. So I think that is all well and good [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5826.8s)]
*  I mean we should we should do those things the thing that I take issue with is that [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5831.52s)]
*  You're on the one hand saying [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5837.280000000001s)]
*  That there's way too much process around just getting things done [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5839.68s)]
*  Right when you're talking about public works [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5844.64s)]
*  But the objection you're making to elon [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5847.2s)]
*  Is that he's not following enough process, you know, it's not enough niceties [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5849.92s)]
*  Larry called it mindless savagery [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5854.72s)]
*  This is the problem is how do you expect anything to ever get done? [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5857.44s)]
*  The reason why your public works projects don't happen is because there's too many special interests who get organized and they stop it [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5860.88s)]
*  Okay, what elon is trying to do we have a two trillion dollar annual deficit. He's trying to figure out how to cut it [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5867.2s)]
*  Every single program that gets cut [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5874.5599999999995s)]
*  The interests who receive that money and we found out that it's hopelessly corrupt [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5877.12s)]
*  You know stacey abrams gets two billion dollars for her non-profit and you have all these ngos who are basically cashing in [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5881.92s)]
*  They're all going to do everything in their power to stop [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5888.4s)]
*  Those cuts from happening [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5891.84s)]
*  And they're the ones who are ginning up this hysteria, you know burning down car dealerships and so forth and so on [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5893.6s)]
*  so this is the problem that I see is that [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5900.32s)]
*  You don't really have a kind word to say for the people who are actually getting things done who actually are forming things [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5903.6s)]
*  Elon is one who's actually making as we have seen. Yeah, can you can you find any good in this? [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5910.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean you you sound like you're cherry picking you when when I brought it up and I questioned you like if you support [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5915.76s)]
*  Those your first thing is to say like well, here's my favorite pet projects. I want to keep those [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5920.8s)]
*  But yes, right like this is I think really important and weirdly it's the through line of almost everything i've said on the show today [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5925.2s)]
*  Knowing what you are trying to achieve [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5933.04s)]
*  Is the first part of achieving it? [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5935.84s)]
*  So doge is cutting things that I think do good in the world. I'm not going to say hey look [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5937.84s)]
*  They're making the government more efficient. We no longer have a you know, a strong [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5942.400000000001s)]
*  Foreign aid program or whatever it might be they've destroyed the department of education without knowing what they're cutting there [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5946.56s)]
*  I don't think doge is doing a good job because I don't think they have in a in a thoughtful way [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5951.360000000001s)]
*  Connected means and ends and weirdly my critique often of democrats is also that they have not been outcomes focused [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5956.8s)]
*  They've been process focused. So david's point here has actually not been the critique i've made here [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5963.599999999999s)]
*  I would make procedural criticisms of doge, but there's a world in which my take on doge [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5968.5599999999995s)]
*  Is look I agree with what they are trying to do, but I wish they would follow the law [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5974.5599999999995s)]
*  But that's not my take on doge if you had to pick [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5978.88s)]
*  Kamala harris continuing the spending that was going on or elon and doge cutting which would you choose I would absolutely [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5981.5199999999995s)]
*  I would absolutely prefer to kamala harris administration to the trump administration [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5987.92s)]
*  Would I like to see democrats be significantly more reformist? Yes, i've written a book about it [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5992.08s)]
*  i'm trying to persuade them of this argument your book is about a [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5996.32s)]
*  Getting rid of this red tape and you just said you want to keep the people who put us a trillion dollar. Hold on [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=5999.84s)]
*  You just yeah, you say you want to change [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6005.5199999999995s)]
*  This is radical change. I agree [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6008.48s)]
*  But you just said you would rather have had the person and the administration that put nine trillion on top of the debt [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6011.28s)]
*  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. This is why you'll never get that change as you guys all invited me here [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6018.08s)]
*  You'll never get the abundance agenda that you want. I don't think because it's people like elon or trump who get things done [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6021.44s)]
*  This is the way that politics work. You have to have a paradigm shift to get what you want [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6028.8s)]
*  Getting dumb things done is not good change, right? [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6033.04s)]
*  I I actually don't understand how this point is so hard to grok [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6036.5599999999995s)]
*  If you get a lot of change and the change is bad, i'm going to think that is bad. Not good [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6040.879999999999s)]
*  I would hope that is true for all of you that if kamala harris or some other democrat came in [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6046.08s)]
*  And began wrecking things that you wouldn't say well, we needed a bunch of change like let's break everything at sight [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6052.08s)]
*  I want to see things done. Well, there should be good permitting reform [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6057.5199999999995s)]
*  I think so. Let me give you an example of the kind of thing that I am looking for [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6061.36s)]
*  We talked about chips a bunch on this show [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6064.48s)]
*  I like the chips act [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6066.799999999999s)]
*  I did a big piece that coined the term everything bagel liberalism about the way in which the ideas inside that act when they began [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6068.0s)]
*  Building out the grant program layered on too many standards and programs and so on but one thing they then did [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6074.719999999999s)]
*  Was they passed a bill or biden signed a bill by ted cruz and mark kelly? [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6081.679999999999s)]
*  Taking chips out of the normal [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6086.639999999999s)]
*  environmental review [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6089.98s)]
*  Because they said look if this is a matter of national security and we're trying to build the semiconductor fab so quickly [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6091.2s)]
*  We cannot have this layered in years of environmental review which now take on average three and a half to four and a half years [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6096.88s)]
*  So because I care a lot about clean energy one of my arguments [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6102.88s)]
*  Is that we should have a speed run for clean energy? [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6106.72s)]
*  It should not go through the normal levels of review [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6109.28s)]
*  What is happening in california high-speed rail where it had 12 years of environmental review was not in my view a good idea [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6111.599999999999s)]
*  At the same time that doesn't force me to say well [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6117.5199999999995s)]
*  I think we should build a bunch of coal plants with that environmental review because I can make [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6119.68s)]
*  Distinctions between things I want to see happen in the world and things I don't I think you're totally right with that [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6123.26s)]
*  Let me give you the more practical day-to-day example because those are these albatross projects that are [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6128.5599999999995s)]
*  largely a byproduct of ineptitude and corruption [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6134.16s)]
*  but let me tell you a more tactical example so that [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6138.24s)]
*  You can understand why? [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6141.68s)]
*  what elon and [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6143.5199999999995s)]
*  Trump are doing is so necessary. So as I told you in 2020 [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6145.6s)]
*  On the back end of covet I started a business to build battery cathode active material in the united states. Okay? [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6150.0s)]
*  So that's a business we need so that when you want to electrify everything you want to electrify there are batteries that we can make [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6157.68s)]
*  That's not reliant on the chinese supply chain. It made sense [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6163.76s)]
*  The guy that I started it with [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6168.080000000001s)]
*  Worked for elon the other guy I started it with was a professor at stanford and the third guy I started it with was the [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6170.08s)]
*  head of battery engineering at toyota a more complete group of people I think you couldn't put together [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6175.2s)]
*  So we start to build we get a deal with general motors so far so good [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6181.76s)]
*  But eventually you hit a point where in order to really commercialize you need some form of government acknowledgement that you're good [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6186.0s)]
*  And the way that you do that is you apply to the doe [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6193.36s)]
*  And the doe has a very legitimate grant program that tries to accelerate these key things, especially things that are critical [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6196.160000000001s)]
*  We went through that program ezra. We paid a couple million dollars in consulting fees to the people that we were told to pay it to [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6203.280000000001s)]
*  And we were rejected [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6210.320000000001s)]
*  Okay, fine kept going. I kept funding the business [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6212.0s)]
*  And then next year last year we applied again [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6215.200000000001s)]
*  125 companies applied [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6218.540000000001s)]
*  25 were shortlisted [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6221.280000000001s)]
*  We all went through incredible diligence we won incredible validation [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6223.759999999999s)]
*  At the end of that entire process so really two years from when I started [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6229.92s)]
*  And millions of dollars we got a hundred million dollar federal grant from the doe and 50 million dollars from michigan to build a plant [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6233.84s)]
*  In michigan to help redomesticate battery cam in the united states [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6241.679999999999s)]
*  It turned out that in that same period while we were going through that rigamarole [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6248.48s)]
*  Stacey abrams got two billion dollars after 30 days [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6253.679999999999s)]
*  And I just asked the question [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6258.0s)]
*  What is broken inside of the government that that's possible that? [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6260.32s)]
*  Us hopelessly corrupt. That's exactly right. It's a company of 50 people 50 people [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6264.48s)]
*  Where none of this money goes into our pockets we take that money and we then have to raise more money [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6270.639999999999s)]
*  I have to put in more money [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6275.759999999999s)]
*  We try to hire people we try to build a battery factory [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6277.599999999999s)]
*  That can basically give us resilience against the chinese which I think is great. They're an incredibly forwarded, you know strong and viable competitor [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6280.88s)]
*  In 30 days, she got 20 times more than we did. How do you explain it? [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6290.320000000001s)]
*  So here's what i'll say on here's what i'll say on the two things and how do you fix it? [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6294.64s)]
*  I have not myself looked deeply into the stacey abrams story [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6298.320000000001s)]
*  But i'm very skeptical of the accounts I keep hearing about it [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6301.04s)]
*  I suspect that if she had made two billion dollars in 30 days, she wouldn't be now hosting a podcast on crooked media [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6303.4400000000005s)]
*  She'd be on an island somewhere. So I can't comment on that piece [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6308.88s)]
*  What I yeah the positive america thing [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6313.2s)]
*  It's a joke from donald trump actually [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6316.400000000001s)]
*  The broader thing here though, right? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6319.84s)]
*  Which is you're getting at you're frankly what I worry about is that what you had in that doe process was fairly quick for the government [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6321.92s)]
*  one of the things that I am targeting in the book [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6328.96s)]
*  Is the way that even when? [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6331.84s)]
*  members of [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6333.900000000001s)]
*  the administration [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6334.96s)]
*  When governors want things to happen [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6336.48s)]
*  They are not willing to upend the process to pass the new bills to reconstruct the architecture of the federal or the state government [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6338.96s)]
*  To get it to happen jerry brown and gavin newson wanted high-speed rail to happen knowledge [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6346.639999999999s)]
*  Can't you acknowledge it's insane that somebody can get two billion dollars after 30 days [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6351.599999999999s)]
*  I am not going to acknowledge a story. I've not looked into myself because i'm not sure I trust the account [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6357.2s)]
*  Okay, I don't think it's crazy [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6362.0s)]
*  I don't think it's crazy to get the money after 30 days [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6364.72s)]
*  But it depends on whether or not the process was good. Hold on [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6366.72s)]
*  I want to stop before you guys move around a bunch of like random. I want to stay on [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6369.28s)]
*  The thing that I want to stay on with abundance for a minute here [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6373.52s)]
*  Is that the thing that I think would be useful to do is actually build legislation? [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6376.4s)]
*  To make these processes work more quickly with more discretion [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6381.36s)]
*  From decision makers and then oversight after the fact rather than heavy process before the fact [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6384.64s)]
*  I was talking to somebody highly involved in the rural broadband programs under o'biden [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6389.92s)]
*  And one of the things they were saying to me was that there is this entire [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6393.6s)]
*  Edifice as he put it of policy that is here to make sure I do nothing wrong [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6397.76s)]
*  What would be better and I think this is right [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6402.8s)]
*  Is to allow me to act more and then look afterwards to see if I did something wrong and then hold be accountable for it [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6405.36s)]
*  I think too much of our regulation is precautionary as opposed to being able to to let people move quickly [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6410.96s)]
*  And make decisions in the real world and then go back and see how they worked out [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6417.12s)]
*  All right. I think that's a great point and I agree with you on that [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6420.64s)]
*  And I think there are a lot of people out there who would say that government's too too bureaucratic [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6424.8s)]
*  There's too much red tape in terms of getting things done any kind of project like the rural broadband takes 15 steps [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6429.200000000001s)]
*  Three of them were dei. That's crazy the environmental reviews and the lawsuits that bog these projects down for years make them [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6434.72s)]
*  unfinanceable [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6442.9400000000005s)]
*  There are people who agree with you on that, you know what they're called republicans [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6444.72s)]
*  Republicans agree with this [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6449.04s)]
*  But you know who doesn't agree with you aoc and elizabeth warren and bernie sanders [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6450.8s)]
*  So maybe you're in the wrong party because I don't think you're going to convince democrats of this. Well, we'll see [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6456.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, I wish you well on that. I hope you appreciate that. Yeah. No, I do [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6462.4800000000005s)]
*  I I think if you can convince democrats of this, I think it'd be a great thing [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6466.320000000001s)]
*  but look this is my issue with some of what you and larry are saying is that [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6469.360000000001s)]
*  You want elon and trump to abide by all of these? [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6474.8s)]
*  Procedural niceties you want them to play by? [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6479.200000000001s)]
*  Marquis of queenberry rules you keep saying this is my view, but it's not my view. You know who get things done [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6482.8s)]
*  And this is what we say in silken valley, you know who get things done disruptive people founders founder mentalities [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6489.12s)]
*  They're the ones who get things done your response as rsb rapper. I know you have to get getting [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6494.320000000001s)]
*  dumb things done [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6500.320000000001s)]
*  Quickly is not a good idea starlink is a much better idea than rural broadband [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6502.0s)]
*  Neither are batteries batteries are not dumb things. You're asking me about what trump and musk are doing right now [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6508.4s)]
*  We started here on the tariffs [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6513.04s)]
*  What what you're watching with trump is using expanded tariff authorities to do things that have a bad process behind them [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6514.96s)]
*  And we'll have a bad set of outcomes. So look i've asked you many many times here [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6521.92s)]
*  I don't really feel like I got the set of metrics I was looking for but we will maybe talk again in two or three [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6526.08s)]
*  Years and we can decide together [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6530.8s)]
*  Was this genius work by the disruptors or was this? [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6533.2s)]
*  A really really dumb approach to economic policy. What was the issue with the metrics that I gave you ezra? [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6537.04s)]
*  You don't think they're complete or I I I don't think I don't think they're you want the unit of measurement kilograms [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6542.08s)]
*  I don't think they're remotely complete [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6547.360000000001s)]
*  I think you're processing us you're doing to us exactly what the government bureaucrats did to rural broadband. What's your metric? [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6549.52s)]
*  How long is it going to take you to deploy this we have to go through a checklist? [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6556.8s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Come on. These are debate tactics. Here's all you need to know ezra. It's a hundred bucks to get starlink [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6559.92s)]
*  It's 15 000 to do fiber. You're trying to debate principles and you're trying to bog it down in procedural arguments [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6565.84s)]
*  Oh, hold on. This is amazing to me [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6572.320000000001s)]
*  You really think saying to you? [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6574.64s)]
*  In two years, what are three or four metrics that would tell us? [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6577.52s)]
*  What you gave me doesn't fit the poll, I mean look we don't need to do this whole thing again [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6582.88s)]
*  But what you gave me doesn't fit the policy. It's just reindustrialization. Hold on [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6586.639999999999s)]
*  We said that we want to reindustrialize america in critical industries, especially [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6590.96s)]
*  And reduce our dependence on foreign supply chains that are based in potential [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6595.599999999999s)]
*  Adversary countries concrete enough as well. Those are why isn't that a sufficient objective? [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6600.0s)]
*  Because the other thing that I the the part of you the part of it that I did not hear those things to be measured was [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6604.4s)]
*  Okay, where is the economy right? There's got to be some cost you don't want to know. So what metric would you want? [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6609.599999999999s)]
*  I'd like to see like okay. GDP growth has been x [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6615.12s)]
*  I will like to hear something about wages. Okay, we want positive GDP growth and we want resiliency for those four critical industries amongst others [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6618.4s)]
*  Okay, and and it'd be nice for the trade deficits come down and you know, especially with certain countries [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6624.24s)]
*  Yes, get back to work then we're all going to get back to work. We got the four critical industries [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6629.28s)]
*  We got the GDP increase and uh, yeah trade deficits. Yeah, it's it's an open debate. All right, Ezra Klein's new book [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6633.04s)]
*  Abundance is out in fine bookstores and amazon and all kinds of other places you can get it and you can hear him [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6640.799999999999s)]
*  on podcasts [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6647.36s)]
*  Incessantly, when are you gonna stop this podcast whereas? Oh my god. No, man [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6649.42s)]

*  Thanks, Ezra. All right. Thanks. How do you think the debate went? [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6658.96s)]
*  I think it's a good debate to have and we made progress here the [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6661.599999999999s)]
*  paradox of all of this is [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6665.66s)]
*  What they're describing in some ways is what trump and elon are doing. Yes, but it's a it's a bit too hot [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6668.3s)]
*  So if I were to give a criticism or room for improvement to the current administration [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6675.5s)]
*  To maybe pull some of these people over [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6681.34s)]
*  It's basically we're slowing down and explaining what's going on a bit better [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6683.98s)]
*  I give the administration like I give dojani plus plus it's obvious like they're doing the right thing [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6688.38s)]
*  I give the communication like a b like just increase the communication and you can see they're doing that [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6694.3s)]
*  Antonio went out and talked a bit about doge [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6699.02s)]
*  They did a round table and they're updating the website faster the more you do that the less [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6701.1s)]
*  The opposition's mind is going to wander the same thing with the tariffs if the tariffs will if that if if the scent was out [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6706.38s)]
*  There front and center every day talking about methodically what their plan was [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6712.700000000001s)]
*  Instead of the shock and awe. I think people would be able to process it quicker [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6717.5s)]
*  Let me just add one thing to that person's opinion, okay [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6721.18s)]
*  I like that obviously you can always say that communication should be better [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6723.66s)]
*  But but here's the reality of it take doge for example [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6726.54s)]
*  You have crazy leftist firebombing tesla dealerships [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6729.82s)]
*  painting swastikas on [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6734.94s)]
*  Tesla cars [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6737.18s)]
*  accosting tesla drivers, okay [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6738.86s)]
*  creating [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6742.2s)]
*  violence and chaos and trying to depress tesla sales, okay [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6743.26s)]
*  And crazy who's to blame for that and then what people say is well somehow elon's the disruptive figure here [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6748.06s)]
*  You have a crazy left wing that's reacting in crazy ways to sensible things that doge is doing and then [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6754.14s)]
*  What people do is they reinterpret this chaos that's been created by the leftists. They somehow put the blame for that on elon [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6760.700000000001s)]
*  I think your uh explanation there is even more reason to be proactively communicating decisions [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6766.860000000001s)]
*  So and that doesn't forgive anybody drawing swastikas on tesla's obviously they should go to jail and if anybody's coordinating it [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6773.34s)]
*  That should be like a rico case and we should find out who it is [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6780.780000000001s)]
*  Just if we're going to bring these two parties together, which I think we came close to here of like finding some common ground [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6783.9800000000005s)]
*  I think chamath you outlining your four bullets and then at the end as we're saying well [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6788.620000000001s)]
*  What's the impact on gdp and then you add into that sax? [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6792.700000000001s)]
*  Well, what's the you know input on the trade difference for the first time? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6795.26s)]
*  You know these two sides I think we outlined what should happen. What should the measure be in two years? [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6799.0199999999995s)]
*  Are have we onshore those important industries is gdp robust? [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6804.54s)]
*  And is the trade deficit deficit more balanced? This is the same debate. We always had over immigration [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6808.86s)]
*  Let's pick a number and work towards a number, right? [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6814.46s)]
*  And that's where the debate in our country breaks down in my mind is that we don't pick numbers [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6817.18s)]
*  We can agree that we need a ton of innovation [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6822.62s)]
*  segue jason go [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcmMOZKnKAk&t=6825.98s)]
