*  Appreciate the call half hour ago. Yeah [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=128.1s)]

*  Shows is magically gonna appear on YouTube and Apple podcasts and Jake house gonna be like what happened exactly [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=164.08s)]
*  So let's not you know [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=170.12s)]
*  Freeburg freeburg is Bernard and Arnaud during the takeover of LVMH, which is a great story if you've never heard about it [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=171.96s)]
*  He basically is like he says he's gonna partner with this Irish entrepreneur to basically buy LVMH and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, they're going through and at the 11th hour [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=187.22s)]
*  He pulls a rug out from him stabs him in the back [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=189.4s)]
*  Basically does the deal himself gets to own LVMH and the rest is history [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=192.04s)]
*  But this is you freeburg. You're pulling a Bernard Arnaud at the last minute. No. No, I would never stab Jake hell in the back [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  I would just you would pass him in the front. You'd [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=201.3s)]
*  Tell him you should show up to work [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  The front and seal the passwords. It's not it's not stabbing in the front. We showed up. He didn't yeah [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=207.8s)]
*  He's trying to exercise passive aggressive control over the pod. He's been outvoted. He does not control the pod [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=212.84s)]
*  We've done 135 episodes and every time we've suggested taking a week off as a group and he doesn't want to he says the show [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=218.76s)]
*  Must go on and he calls up a guest and he keeps the show going at his whim and his [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=226.28s)]
*  Discretion so this week we are doing the same the show must go on J Cal is enjoying a summer break wherever he is [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=232.16s)]
*  May he I think we're all on vacation this week, right? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=238.24s)]
*  I know he why he didn't want the show to go on is he has a deep insecurity that he might get replaced at some point [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=241.44s)]
*  Yeah by someone smarter than him [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=247.72s)]
*  Gerson you were supposed to replace me, but you might end up replacing Jake [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=254.56s)]
*  The truth is the truth is last year remember the fateful morning [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=260.68s)]
*  When I get a call from Chema and he said hey [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=266.84s)]
*  We need you to come in Jake house out we got [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  We need to win is the fourth and I think that I did Chema [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=274.96s)]
*  My my phone rings and it's Jake out and he said Friedberg's out [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=279.4s)]
*  I had both guys going at the same time and it's been that way for the last 12 months [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=288.32s)]
*  Yeah, I was in Vegas with when I had to sort this out it burned an entire day a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=295.92s)]
*  Year ago, it was a year ago. Well at least we got our at least we got our LLC Doc sign [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=303.36s)]
*  That's that's what came out of it [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=307.88s)]
*  It's it's literally like the show billions, you know [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=310.36s)]
*  Yeah, all the intrigue or whatever [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=314.48s)]
*  But that's why Jake I wanted to sabotage the show rather than have it go on without him because he's afraid that the audience [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=316.08s)]
*  Might like the show better without him [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=323.48s)]
*  There's certainly been a lot of commenters saying that sort of thing [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=325.92s)]
*  Oh, I guess we're gonna find out the fans need to let us know what they think of this episode. All right [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=329.52s)]
*  Well, let's kick it off first [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=334.12s)]
*  Topic on the docket today, which I think is a great one and Chema [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=337.0s)]
*  If you've been tweeting a lot lately as we just talked about I think that'll end up probably being our cold open [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=340.0s)]
*  but [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=345.12s)]
*  Zuck announced and Facebook meta announced the launch of threads Gerstner big shareholder of meta I think right [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=347.03999999999996s)]
*  reasonable reasonably sized shareholder [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=354.03999999999996s)]
*  This is like this morning announced 30 million downloads of the app overnight threads is [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=356.24s)]
*  Instagram slash Facebook slash Metas [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=362.92s)]
*  Competitor to Twitter looks almost like a clone [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=365.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean it is so similar in features in interaction in everything Brad [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  maybe you can kick us off and talk a little bit about the importance of threads and [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=374.72s)]
*  How this is important to Meta and then we can talk a little bit about the app itself [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=378.44s)]
*  Well, I mean the first thing is if rumors are true [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=382.88s)]
*  They develop this over a period of six to nine months with 20 people [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=386.68s)]
*  Okay, and so the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=391.76s)]
*  Extraordinary pace that's now occurring with inside or inside metal [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=394.84s)]
*  We've heard from several people inside that said people are pumped. They're actually updating real-time [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=399.62s)]
*  User counts there over 30 million users already on Instagram and it just gets back to this culture [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=405.88s)]
*  of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=412.59999999999997s)]
*  Flattening the organization speeding up the organization. I think everybody's excited [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=413.2s)]
*  You know the best engineers in the world want to see their products set free [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=417.68s)]
*  And so, you know, I think threads is really interesting for a couple reasons [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=421.71999999999997s)]
*  number one [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  If we flash back to what went on in China with toti on doya and remember that text-based social networks were where? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  Kind of it started there and so it's a bit anomalous [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  Doya which is the tick-tock equivalent in China was started based on toti out which was a text-based newsfeed and [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=437.8s)]
*  So it doesn't surprise me to see the social graph being leveraged into a text-based [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  Feed I think initially they're seeding it obviously with all your friends [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=451.92s)]
*  So it's it's it looks more like celebs and entertainment and it's my team is like it's easier to use [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=456.12s)]
*  It's faster. It feels more free [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  I think you know Adam is sorry he posted on threads that he stayed up all night last night [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=466.6s)]
*  So excited with a product launch. He and Zuck are responding to people actually live on threads [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=473.08000000000004s)]
*  And so I part of this just goes to the pulse of the company over the next four to six weeks [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=479.6s)]
*  They're gonna have massive launches out of the AI side of the business [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=484.44s)]
*  I expect a lot more support for their open AI model or for their open [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=488.48s)]
*  LLM I also think they're gonna launch a bunch of agents on whatsapp and Instagram [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=493.64s)]
*  So what I see is just velocity and cycle time within the business improving and then one final thing [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  in the age of AI [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=504.08s)]
*  right you want to collect as much data as you can from your users and [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=506.23999999999995s)]
*  We know that [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=511.2s)]
*  Facebook is very heavy on video and pictures [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=513.04s)]
*  but what they're light on is text and so in a world where the most important [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=517.12s)]
*  Thing on the internet to train your model is this is the word [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=522.84s)]
*  Right now they're gonna collect a lot of words a lot of conversations a lot of sentiment among the users [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=527.2800000000001s)]
*  and you know, maybe we'll come back to this, you know, I just want to kick it back and get people's thoughts on the product but [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=533.5600000000001s)]
*  Already by my estimate these guys get to a hundred million which is looks like they may be able to get to tonight [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=539.88s)]
*  Based upon the monetization that Twitter has that's already a business [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=545.4s)]
*  That's doing something like two and a half billion dollars in revenue if they chose to monetize it [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=550.28s)]
*  1.2 or 1.5 billion in EBIT apply their current multiple to that [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=556.12s)]
*  That's about a 20 billion dollar increase in enterprise value built by if rumors are true 20 people over a course of six months [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=560.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty impressive. I remember in the early days of Friendster and myspace and then even Facebook [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=569.28s)]
*  These social networks launched and everyone thought it was going to be a conversational system and [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=576.16s)]
*  So much of the usage and the page views and the minutes spent ultimately accrued to photos and over time video [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=581.12s)]
*  And now it's almost like this interesting reversion back to the origin that it's back to this conversational system [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=588.92s)]
*  But these systems always seem to kind of evolve to hey just images or what when and what? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=594.48s)]
*  Kind of gather up all the the mind space. I mean Chum up having worked at Facebook [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=599.28s)]
*  Maybe you can share a little bit about your point of view on threads as a product and [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=603.56s)]
*  as an evolution away from social network on Facebook to Instagram and now the threads I [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=608.36s)]
*  Think what people don't understand is that? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=614.68s)]
*  the successful category winner in each of these categories [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=617.68s)]
*  Needed to invent something de novo that nobody else had in the case of Facebook [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=622.36s)]
*  We invented photo tagging when it didn't exist and then we invented the newsfeed [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=626.76s)]
*  When it didn't exist and then there was a bunch of people that copied it [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=631.12s)]
*  But it didn't matter because we had refined and owned that use case already [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=634.68s)]
*  So I think the real challenge for Facebook isn't can 20 people copy Twitter. I [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=639.92s)]
*  Mean, you know mastodon is a copy of Twitter. There's a bunch of parlors a copy of Twitter truth social is a copy of Twitter [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=645.92s)]
*  The challenge is going to be can you invent some de novo feature that makes people actually want to use this? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=654.24s)]
*  and [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=661.2s)]
*  You know rage quitting Twitter because you're not a fan of the product right now or Elon isn't a successful [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=661.8s)]
*  Long-term use case because all of those people will eventually come back [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=670.24s)]
*  So, I don't know. I'm a little bit more skeptical of the whole thing. I think that [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=674.52s)]
*  Right now what you see is not even a full copy of the system [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=679.08s)]
*  It's you know a 50 60 percent copy with a lot less usage and so as a result a lot less traffic [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=682.66s)]
*  But I think you need something new, you know tick-tock the reason why it became successful [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=689.2s)]
*  Was it was a fundamentally new use case relative to the alternatives and I think that that captures people's imagination and mind-share [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=694.44s)]
*  so this is not what threads does and so [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=702.5200000000001s)]
*  In as much as it's a copy of something that is already an established behavior [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=706.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't think it has very high chances of success, but don't stories and and and reals undermine that argument [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=710.96s)]
*  I mean reals was a copy of tick-tock and stories was a copy of snapchat and they're both giant products today [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=717.92s)]
*  I think that you can definitely copy features into an existing product with new distribution [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=725.12s)]
*  But to invent a new product fully from scratch, that's a carbon copy of something [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=730.76s)]
*  But again reals attaches onto Instagram, which is a unique use case [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=735.36s)]
*  Right. And so I think that again it goes back to you have these five or six [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=741.04s)]
*  established [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=746.12s)]
*  modes of social media that essentially are from large pieces of content to small pieces [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=747.3199999999999s)]
*  That's probably the best organizing principle that we have and then that's one axis and the other axis is text video audio and [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=753.0s)]
*  Along that spectrum you can basically compartmentalize all these things and then there are about four of them [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=760.04s)]
*  that have real scale and [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=765.68s)]
*  And so in as much as you have established distribution, yes [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=768.0s)]
*  You can copy a feature from somebody else and it will get used but that's not what this is [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=771.68s)]
*  So if this instead gets integrated instant Instagram [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=776.04s)]
*  I think it's much more dangerous to Twitter than as a standalone product as a standalone product [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=779.64s)]
*  I tend to think it's to a for the most part unless again it invents something [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=785.8s)]
*  Totally new that we're missing [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=792.0s)]
*  Sex you're an advisor to Twitter. What do you advise Elon and you know, how do you think about this as a competitive threat? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=794.28s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not a formal advisor to Twitter. I was just a guy hanging around during the transition [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=800.04s)]
*  No, look, I mean I tend to agree with with Chamath the thing that Facebook did really well here is there's a one-click [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=805.06s)]
*  Sign-up flow from Instagram where you just click to download threads and then you can log in with your [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=812.7399999999999s)]
*  Instagram account and port over your bio and all of your data and your social graph [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=819.78s)]
*  So it's super easy to get set up but by the same token [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=824.8199999999999s)]
*  You know if they have 10 million or even 30 million signups [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=828.9799999999999s)]
*  That's really just a 3% conversion rate on the billion, you know users at Instagram house [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=833.02s)]
*  So a lot of people are just gonna make that a click because they're curious [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=839.66s)]
*  They want to find out what threads is I wouldn't be surprised that I got 100 million users or 200 million users [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=843.86s)]
*  That way just people, you know clicking over from Instagram to see what this new thing is [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=849.42s)]
*  The question is what's gonna be the habit-forming behavior here and the people who use Twitter are really addicted to using Twitter [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=854.54s)]
*  It's where the conversation is there is a strong network effect [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=862.74s)]
*  They're not just around the users and the social graph but like the habit of daily use [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=866.1s)]
*  So, you know how many of these people who are signing up are actually gonna go use it every day [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=872.94s)]
*  Are they gonna take the time to copy over to kind of copy paste all of their? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=877.38s)]
*  Twitter posts over to this new medium and then what about all the comments or replies? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=883.3s)]
*  So I wouldn't just look at the signups here [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=887.66s)]
*  I think you have to look at like the amount of posting and the actual usage before you know that Twitter has a threat [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=890.28s)]
*  Right. Did did any of you guys use it this morning or last night? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=897.6s)]
*  Yes [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=902.88s)]
*  What I mean, what do you think we had in the UX, you know, we had we had our team playing with it [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=904.9599999999999s)]
*  You know all morning and I started sharing with you [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=909.28s)]
*  You know there it feels to our team like common words being used were snappier faster lower hurdle [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=912.9599999999999s)]
*  Like it felt more fun and social therefore you it wasn't as [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=920.3199999999999s)]
*  Considered a post right because most of the posts at least [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=925.0s)]
*  You know that our team engages in on Twitter are for mostly business purposes, right? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=929.6s)]
*  And so there's politics and business and more serious topics, right? Instagram is the home for fun [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=935.4399999999999s)]
*  It's for frivolity. It's showing pictures of your friends [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=941.6s)]
*  And so I think it's going to orient more in that direction [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=944.36s)]
*  And again, there's probably room in the world for a tech space social network around [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=947.92s)]
*  Entertainment and culture and food and and the fun stuff and there's probably room for one [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=953.4399999999999s)]
*  That's more about politics and business and you know more serious topics and perhaps they'll converge more over time. I [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=957.92s)]
*  You know, I think it's an interesting thing. Yes, it's one click, but you have to download a new app [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=964.56s)]
*  I mean this isn't you know, just open up your Instagram and all of a sudden click on a new tab [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=969.8s)]
*  Right and by my account [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=975.7s)]
*  I think it's just in the US that they launched this so their conversion rates probably over 10% already in [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=977.1s)]
*  24 hours and you got to download an app to get there [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=982.7s)]
*  You know that feels to me like a little bit more of a hurdle [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=986.26s)]
*  But I agree with both of you at the end of the day [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=988.82s)]
*  It's going to be about engagement not about how many people you got to download the app and if they get high engagement [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=991.02s)]
*  You know, and I think there's plenty of surface area for these guys to monetize [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=996.7s)]
*  That combined with you know, Chamath pointed out, you know [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1001.1800000000001s)]
*  As much as we love Elon certainly there are people Chamath you brought up with respect to Tesla that are orienting a way because of the brand [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1004.9s)]
*  Right, like it may make sense or not, but we know it's happening. And so I do think that there's a natural momentum [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1012.78s)]
*  I think this was you know, like if this was the cage match, right if this was the MMA between the two of them [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1019.02s)]
*  This is certainly, you know an offensive blow that that you know meta just landed here and I expect that you know [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1026.1399999999999s)]
*  It's gonna amp up the heat [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1033.36s)]
*  So it's interesting because at the same time as threads is launching to compete [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1035.1999999999998s)]
*  with Twitter [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1042.1999999999998s)]
*  There's some really interesting data coming out showing declining usage of chat GPT [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1043.7199999999998s)]
*  And interest level in Bard [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1050.32s)]
*  So both if you look at Google Trends as well as data coming out of similar web which tracks usage across sites [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1052.04s)]
*  Chat GPT usage seems to be falling [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1059.44s)]
*  from a peak in May [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1063.76s)]
*  And it had a modest increase from March to April and then an even less modest increase from April to May and May to June [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1066.44s)]
*  We're actually seeing a decline in usage. The question is is this driven by [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1073.04s)]
*  Educational usage so a lot of kids were using chat GPT to write essays and to use it in school and that seems to be a primary [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1078.04s)]
*  use case or does it speak to a more broad kind of [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1083.1200000000001s)]
*  Challenge with chat GPT really disrupting search and disrupting [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1087.04s)]
*  Other ways that people are kind of accessing and browsing the internet [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1091.48s)]
*  That it that as an interface [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1095.72s)]
*  Maybe it's a little bit too challenged and it doesn't replace the the simple two-word keyword click and click on the result [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1097.64s)]
*  I'd love your guys point of view on the product and the experience as well as why do we think that there's declining usage? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1104.96s)]
*  In chat GPT well you had these products launch in a in a moment where there was in many ways a usage vacuum [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1110.6399999999999s)]
*  What I mean by that is if you look back over like the last 15 or 20 years [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1119.48s)]
*  There were these waves that would create these layers of innovation that consumers would infatuated with and try [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1124.76s)]
*  Actually came right it came right on the heels of a pretty massive head fake [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1130.92s)]
*  Which was around VR and that was supposed to be this next big tidal wave of consumer innovation [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1135.92s)]
*  Which turned out to be just a total fart in the wind [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1142.76s)]
*  And so I think that there was a setup here [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1146.3600000000001s)]
*  Where consumers were you know? [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1149.96s)]
*  Hanchering for something really interesting and unique and so I think that there was a set up here where consumers were you know? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1152.28s)]
*  Hanchering for something really interesting and unique and new a novel a [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1158.92s)]
*  lot of people wrap those labels around the chat versions of [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1163.0s)]
*  these LLMs and [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1169.0800000000002s)]
*  So you had again this explosion of usage, but I think what we're going to find there [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1171.0800000000002s)]
*  Is that there's some pretty useful use cases, but narrow [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1176.96s)]
*  where these chat interfaces are very [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1182.4s)]
*  Useful and [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1185.24s)]
*  The usage will decay to that number and that number is probably a fraction of what the peak was [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1186.52s)]
*  Mean so then people will get disillusioned and the press will say this was you know another fad from Silicon Valley [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1194.48s)]
*  But then I think the reality is that the real stuff which is around enterprise software [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1201.0s)]
*  health care [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1205.92s)]
*  the physical sciences [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1207.72s)]
*  That's where the real AI [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1210.0s)]
*  Leaps I think will have really momentous value [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1212.0s)]
*  Those are still 18 to 24 to 36 months away from seeing the light of day in [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1214.92s)]
*  In terms of real products that that actually work so [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1219.24s)]
*  Yeah, again, you know it's part of the hype cycle and we all kind of fell for it the only winner here is Nvidia [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1223.72s)]
*  I think the loser here are most of the VCs who pumped in hundreds of millions to billions of dollars in rando stuff too early [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1228.88s)]
*  And the consumers they tried it they didn't like it they moved on they're waiting for the next [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1236.76s)]
*  Zach's agreed disagree [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1243.2s)]
*  Well, I think that's that's going a little bit too far [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1245.6s)]
*  I mean I I think that there may be a couple of things going on here one is that the curiosity factor [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1247.96s)]
*  May have been played out. I mean the novelty has worn off a little bit. I think there was a lot of people [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1253.68s)]
*  Using it initially just to see what it could do and hearing about it and wanting to test it out [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1259.64s)]
*  So I think people have sort of scratched that itch also school is now out of sessions [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1264.3200000000002s)]
*  So for all the people who are using it to do some kind of academic research, there's not a need to do that right now [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1269.0800000000002s)]
*  I I do agree that the use cases that are most exciting to me are our enterprise uses [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1275.88s)]
*  And I agree with Tomas about that and I think that is all still to come. I think in terms of the consumer I [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1282.3200000000002s)]
*  Don't think it's going away. But I think that [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1289.0400000000002s)]
*  They're gonna have to improve the the accuracy they're going to improve the performance the speed of it [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1292.06s)]
*  Maybe improve the interface add some more features if they want to get to the next level of usage [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1297.78s)]
*  I mean think about think about the product today, you know 100 million downloads the whole [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1302.86s)]
*  The whole downtick here is explained by kids being out of school [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1308.54s)]
*  I mean it's down 10% and [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1311.78s)]
*  Like kids have to be more than 20% of the usage of this. They don't like they [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1314.02s)]
*  So I think you said that say but just think about how hard it is to use this product, right if you [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1318.74s)]
*  Most people you have four million people paying 20 bucks a month [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1324.3s)]
*  Could you imagine people paying 20 bucks a month to use Google then on top of that try downloading plugins? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1327.02s)]
*  It's still a pain in the ass [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1333.06s)]
*  And if you don't have a plug-in, I think there are only five hundred thousand people using plug-in [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1334.18s)]
*  If you don't have a plug-in you have no new data past [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1338.22s)]
*  2021 which makes it dead on arrival as a product [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1341.58s)]
*  So I don't even think I think we're so early in this that to judge the chat interface based upon the product that exists today [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1344.6599999999999s)]
*  I think it's a huge mistake. I [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1351.8999999999999s)]
*  Think that what we're going to see is kids come back to school [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1354.4199999999998s)]
*  You're gonna see the normal uptick in traffic [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1358.26s)]
*  It probably hangs out around this hundred million hundred and fifty million level in terms of usage [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1360.26s)]
*  I think the next 10 X for a chat based interface at least is it in so far as it concerns the consumer is [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1365.4199999999998s)]
*  when we move to from information retrieval to action and [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1373.54s)]
*  You've heard Zuckerberg talk about this on the Lex Friedman podcast. You've heard [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1379.34s)]
*  You've heard meta talk about you know this outside of that context and then you've heard Mustafa talk about it from pie [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1386.1399999999999s)]
*  Which is this idea that I say hey show me the five best hotels in Milan [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1393.4599999999998s)]
*  It shows you five hotels and then you say book me [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1398.26s)]
*  The chip Riani for these dates and it actually will book it directly with the hotel engaging with an agent there [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1403.22s)]
*  No Mustafa from pie says this is months away [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1408.9399999999998s)]
*  Zuckerberg alludes to the fact that they're gonna have action bots on WhatsApp and Instagram in the not-too-distant future [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1412.58s)]
*  I think all of the you know, all the links exist in the world to do this today [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1419.46s)]
*  So I would say look for that as the next 10 X feature for consumer facing chatbots [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1424.36s)]
*  And then finally I just say I was at the snowflake summit last week. There were 600 applications [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1429.52s)]
*  So new startups that applied [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1435.6799999999998s)]
*  For their startup contest they were each using an application of chat GPT build on top of snowflake data [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1438.6s)]
*  600 new companies and this is it, you know, they just they just launched their application layer [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1446.8s)]
*  So there's a tremendous appetite for people to help enterprises right access that information and build much more seamless [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1451.8999999999999s)]
*  Discovery on top of it. I I tried to use chat GPT the mobile app on July 4th [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1459.86s)]
*  I was just trying to find a good quote to use in a you know [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1465.06s)]
*  But like an American patriot or founder or framework of the Constitution something like that [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1468.9599999999998s)]
*  To use to tweet out for July 4th and it just aired out on me [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1473.4599999999998s)]
*  And it was like one of these error messages that you can tell an engineer road [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1477.1799999999998s)]
*  It's it's totally not anticipated error and I tried it like two or three different ways a couple of different chat threads [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1480.42s)]
*  Just didn't work. It's completely inexplicable. So when you have those kinds of experiences [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1487.3000000000002s)]
*  It makes you just want to go to Google which is what I did, you know [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1491.8600000000001s)]
*  I actually went to Google to find what I was looking for [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1495.26s)]
*  I thought chat GPT could do a better job because I thought it could help me think find things that would be [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1497.7s)]
*  Specifically appropriate for July 4th. So I was curious to see what opinion it might have [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1504.0600000000002s)]
*  But Google is just much more performant [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1509.1s)]
*  So they have to like work out those kinks. I mean, that's that's pretty clear [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1512.34s)]
*  I think like natural language prediction as a capability is [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1516.9s)]
*  Certainly here to say to stay along with the agents and the action bots that can integrate behind the scenes to do things for you [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1521.5s)]
*  The real question for me is is this a winner interface if I think back to you? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1529.14s)]
*  User interfaces user experience in the history of computing [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1534.66s)]
*  We can kind of go back to the original terminal interface on DOS and you would you know [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1538.1s)]
*  Have like lines that you would type and you know [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1542.58s)]
*  You would kind of program the computer to do stuff [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1544.54s)]
*  That was almost like the first real computing interface that people could use and then there was windows and when windows came along [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1546.22s)]
*  It was a new type of interface a new type of interaction model [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1553.42s)]
*  And then we had the icons that arose with the iPad iPhone revolution [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1556.66s)]
*  And obviously the internet the browser was a was a new UX and the browser provided hyperlinks and in one window you would click [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1562.42s)]
*  Through and go to lots of different things and then that browser interface eventually integrated images and video and then the interface that [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1569.22s)]
*  We're almost used to lately that we all probably spend most of our time on is the scrolling interface [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1575.94s)]
*  Where there's infinite personalized content created for you and you just keep scrolling whether that's on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1580.8600000000001s)]
*  or what have you and that's where we spend a lot of our time now and [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1587.02s)]
*  If you think about the transition you're getting more for less meaning you're getting more content [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1590.58s)]
*  You're getting more output with less input the challenge with the chat interface [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1595.6200000000001s)]
*  Is that you're getting almost today in its current iteration a little bit less output because it's mostly textual and it's requiring more [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1599.98s)]
*  Input you're having to write sentences and ask it stuff [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1607.7s)]
*  And so I think if you think about the evolution of user interfaces in computing [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1610.7s)]
*  Chat as an interface faces quite a bit of friction the output of it [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1616.06s)]
*  However is so compelling in certain use cases that Chabot points out that there's certainly going to be places where it's absolutely going to [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1619.9s)]
*  Replace the current modality and then the back end of it can do incredible things that no other computing interface can do [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1625.5s)]
*  But it needs to have you know kind of a revision or a rebuild on the front end for it to really work that [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1632.8600000000001s)]
*  That's my point of view and how I think about kind of the long trajectory of where we've all been trained [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1638.18s)]
*  Mentally with respect to computing interfaces and how this might kind of be challenged [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1642.22s)]
*  I think that's the key how you know four older guys have been trained watch how kids interact with their phones first [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1646.42s)]
*  They're never on a computer [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1654.0600000000002s)]
*  They're always on their phones and they're always talking to their phones and it's always chat based and so I think we have a new [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1655.66s)]
*  Generation that like it's so native to the way that they interact with the world and you know to be honest [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1661.66s)]
*  I was sitting there this morning prepping for the for the pod and I had a brilliant [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1669.42s)]
*  Conversation with chat GPT about what happened with rates and inflation etc in 2000 2001 2002 is interactive [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1674.1000000000001s)]
*  I was using my voice. I wasn't typing anything. I thought it was terrific way better than the experience [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1681.26s)]
*  I would have on Google. So again, I think we're early in the evolution of this [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1686.42s)]
*  But you know, I think that you know for my kids. This is completely native [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1690.6200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think for kids it's amazing [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1695.98s)]
*  I just don't think kids will have 20 30 40 bucks a month to spend on this [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1698.2s)]
*  I mean they some kids will but that that'll just further exacerbate [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1701.7s)]
*  The divide of the kids that can versus the kids that can't but I don't think that that's what's gonna create [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1705.7s)]
*  Evaluation framework for a multi-deck a billion dollar company if you want to see a well-used education product, you know [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1712.42s)]
*  Chegg's got something probably [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1718.7s)]
*  You know, this probably is good and that's a three or four billion dollar market cap company last time I checked yeah [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1721.5s)]
*  Well Brad you mentioned yet you were doing a little research for the pod talking about rates [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1727.66s)]
*  Obviously that was in anticipation of the discussion on [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1733.82s)]
*  the Federal Reserve [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1738.42s)]
*  Meeting minutes that came out a couple days ago. I'll read a few excerpts from the published minutes [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1740.22s)]
*  Were obviously the Federal Reserve meets to discuss overnight rates whether to raise rates and their outlook for rates [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1748.46s)]
*  Driven in part by current economic data including their view on inflation their view on economic activity [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1756.02s)]
*  Etc reading from the notes directly [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1763.1000000000001s)]
*  Participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high and noted that the data including the CPI for May [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1766.66s)]
*  Indicated that declines in inflation had been slower than they had expected [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1771.98s)]
*  Participants observed that although core goods inflation had moderated since the middle of last year [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1776.66s)]
*  It had slowed less rapidly than expected in recent months despite data and reports from business [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1780.8600000000001s)]
*  Contacts indicating that supply chain constraints had continued to ease [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1786.5s)]
*  In their discussion on the household sector [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1790.26s)]
*  They noted that consumer spending so far this year has been stronger than expected and that aggregate household wealth remained high as [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1792.26s)]
*  Equity and home prices had not declined much from the recent highs and a few participants mentioned that while overall the household [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1799.46s)]
*  sector [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1805.98s)]
*  Still retain much of the excess savings in it accumulated during the pandemic [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1807.18s)]
*  There were signs that consumers were facing increasingly tighter budgets given high inflation, especially for low-income households despite savings [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1810.98s)]
*  So Brad, maybe you can give us your quick read on the minutes and they did say that they're not raising rates [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1817.94s)]
*  But they do expect two more [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1822.22s)]
*  25 basis point rate hikes later this year [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1824.54s)]
*  Maybe you can tell us what market data is indicating is that actually the case and is the Fed not giving a [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1826.74s)]
*  Clean reading on economic activity and inflation as it's being published in other places than what the Fed is currently reading [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1832.46s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think the most interesting thing here and perhaps the most non consensus thing [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1839.7s)]
*  Here is the Fed kind of seems to be orchestrating a pretty soft landing [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1845.9s)]
*  Right. Nobody wants to hear it the market fought it for the first half of the year [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1851.02s)]
*  The NASDAQ was just up 39% in the first half and most people didn't participate [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1854.7s)]
*  So everybody wants to talk this down and say that inflation is still out of control Chumas been talking about [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1859.62s)]
*  Inflation higher for longer, but notice he doesn't say that's a problem or the economy therefore is going to crash [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1865.5s)]
*  Just like inflation is going to be a little stickier on the way down [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1871.22s)]
*  Rates are going to be a little bit higher for longer [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1875.06s)]
*  I think when you look at this in totality the reason they hit pause is because they've come a long way quickly [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1877.62s)]
*  They know that things are starting to trend in the right direction [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1884.5s)]
*  So their own forecast for CPI is that it comes down a lot by the end of the year [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1888.14s)]
*  Goldman Sachs is now at 3.3% [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1893.5400000000002s)]
*  And I know we have readings like true inflation that say the inflation today is actually lower than that [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1895.66s)]
*  But you don't even need to get to the debate between true inflation and CPI [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1901.1000000000001s)]
*  They're both trending a lot lower, but we got a really interesting reading this morning because like why do we want to you know? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1905.14s)]
*  Raise rates well we want to cool off the economy and so everybody's looking for that indication that the economy is cooling the leading [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1912.3s)]
*  indicator for this is jobs [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1919.5s)]
*  So we had a really hot ADP jobs report this morning, right over [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1921.6599999999999s)]
*  450,000 new jobs created and everybody got nervous the 10-year shot up to over 4% the market turned down at the start of the day [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1927.54s)]
*  And then we got the jolts report now Larry Summers has described jolts as a much more [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1935.54s)]
*  That's job openings. Okay, so this is more of a leading indicator like how many of the job openings are we consuming? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1941.5s)]
*  And that actually came in better than expected [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1948.18s)]
*  So what it suggested is that more people took jobs? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1951.02s)]
*  Then we had anticipated and remember jolts peaked closer to 12 million and now we're at about [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1955.18s)]
*  9.8 million and so when I look at that [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1962.46s)]
*  You know and then look at the jobs report ADP jobs report over half of the new jobs created were in hospitality and leisure [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1966.02s)]
*  So think about what was happening a year ago [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1973.62s)]
*  Airlines were trying to hire people restaurants were trying to hire people hotels were trying to hire people and nobody took the job for two reasons [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1976.2199999999998s)]
*  Number one they were afraid of kovat, but number two they were getting stemmy checks from the government. They didn't need to work [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1983.34s)]
*  Now what we see is people are starting to take jobs those show up as higher employment numbers [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1990.06s)]
*  In ADP but in lower jolts, right? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1995.8999999999999s)]
*  So fewer job openings to me again that probably speaks to a you know, healthy trend in the economy [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=1998.9399999999998s)]
*  But clearly the economy is not crashing [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2007.1s)]
*  We had a lot of people who said that the economy was going to hit the skids in Q1 or Q2 of this year due to [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2009.62s)]
*  These higher rates the economy is incredibly resilient [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2015.3s)]
*  But if I had to describe, you know the rate trajectory the Fed has said listen, we may have two more rate hikes [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2018.74s)]
*  That's basically priced in and if you look at real rates [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2024.74s)]
*  So this is the the interest rate that really acts as the brake on the economy [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2028.34s)]
*  So this is effectively the 10-year versus future expected inflation [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2034.6200000000001s)]
*  It's now at one of the highest levels we've had since 2008 2009 back closing in on 2% [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2039.66s)]
*  So, you know, it seems to me that the feds got its foot pretty strong on the brake [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2046.82s)]
*  It's job-burning the economy saying we'll do more if we have to but the things that they're looking at job openings are coming down [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2051.58s)]
*  Inflation is coming down [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2059.5s)]
*  So I don't know [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2060.74s)]
*  I think you have to leave open the possibility that the fat part of the distribution curve [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2061.7s)]
*  Looks like a softer landing than most people want to want to admit. Yes, so Chimath Gersner is predicting a soft landing [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2066.1s)]
*  Do you agree? I mean you've said we're gonna see rates stay high for a very long period of time [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2072.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think I've said this for the last few weeks [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2077.02s)]
*  So I'll just say it again, but I think that it's there's no hard landing, right? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2079.46s)]
*  That's the hard landing was sort of the Druckenmiller thing that said I think that you know, I said I think it was a few weeks ago [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2083.78s)]
*  It's very difficult to see a hard landing [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2090.6600000000003s)]
*  when China stimulates [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2093.94s)]
*  Just because of their natural gravitational pull in the world economy and you know [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2096.26s)]
*  We can talk about that again because it just looks like China's in super super super trouble [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2102.58s)]
*  Meanwhile, I sent this little image to you and Freeberg you may just want to throw it up here just to look at but [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2107.94s)]
*  You know when you look at inflation [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2114.1800000000003s)]
*  we've done the best job of the developed nations in getting this thing under control and so I [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2116.2200000000003s)]
*  Think now it's just about [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2122.1400000000003s)]
*  Making sure that we adequately contract the money supply and making sure that we have [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2124.5800000000004s)]
*  Bullets in the chamber in case things get bad. What do I mean when you look at this chart? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2130.5800000000004s)]
*  The thing that I think about is I'm glad rates are almost at 6% [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2136.5800000000004s)]
*  Why because when you look at the UK Italy Germany most of the euro area France Japan and then you know [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2140.1800000000003s)]
*  China it's non-existent, but China is a different issue [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2148.54s)]
*  the reality is that you know a [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2152.34s)]
*  Pretty bad set of economic circumstances [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2156.38s)]
*  Could actually touch the Western developed nations if you start to see some of these countries [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2158.78s)]
*  Rip rates higher to like seven eight nine percent the UK it seems like I don't know what you guys think [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2164.02s)]
*  It's definitely going to seven and it could go to eight. I mean it could be a very bad situation for the UK [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2169.66s)]
*  They're in a lot of trouble. And so I think it's important that the Federal Reserve [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2175.7799999999997s)]
*  Have tools [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2181.2999999999997s)]
*  So by continuing to constrict the money supply have rates that are relatively elevated [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2182.8599999999997s)]
*  Maybe a quarter or two longer than they need to it gives them a lot of positive [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2187.9s)]
*  Optionality if they need to step in if something bad really happens, and so I generally think they've done a very good job [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2192.6200000000003s)]
*  To my not to interrupt to your point what's really interesting is the symmetry with what happened in 2000 [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2201.82s)]
*  So I think I think we had all agreed that the last time we saw the zaniness that we saw in [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2207.46s)]
*  2021 in the ZERP environment was probably like [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2214.54s)]
*  1999-2000 era well in 2000 remember we had this huge asset bubble and the Fed raised rates from five and a half to six percent [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2218.38s)]
*  in [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2225.94s)]
*  2000 okay in the first half of 2000 and they were saying that they're gonna stay high for long and [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2226.8199999999997s)]
*  Remember in 2001 we entered a recession and we end in [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2232.7799999999997s)]
*  2001 with rates all the way down at one point seven five percent [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2237.2599999999998s)]
*  Those are the bullets in the chamber that you're talking about that then pulled us out of the recession [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2241.6600000000003s)]
*  You know and some people blame them that they caused that reception recession [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2247.1400000000003s)]
*  But you know when you look back from this case it looks like yeah in this case [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2251.06s)]
*  It looks like the recession is really not of our making but you know [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2255.46s)]
*  We may actually have a soft landing [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2258.4s)]
*  But the economy could actually contract because when you look at these Western economies turning over it's it's not a good situation [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2260.1000000000004s)]
*  I think the eurozone fight on a seat is probably a quarter into a recession already, so you know we have [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2267.06s)]
*  Six or seven of the really important countries [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2276.14s)]
*  Probably in a recession the UK in really big trouble the US relatively keeping things [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2279.5s)]
*  You know in a pretty good place [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2286.54s)]
*  China [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2288.38s)]
*  Economically, I don't know where the demand is gonna come from you know on the same time that there that their internal demand is imploding [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2289.7s)]
*  They're creating all these export controls that I think guys are not going to actually help them solve the problem because it just accelerates [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2296.2200000000003s)]
*  Western economies desire to delever from China [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2304.82s)]
*  So the whole setup. I think is very complicated one, but the US looks really good frankly [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2308.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, look I don't think we're out of the woods quite yet, so so Druckenmiller by the way said that [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2315.06s)]
*  He was predicting a hard landing in the second half of the year [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2320.98s)]
*  We're just starting the second half of the year, so he's still got six months to be proven correct [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2323.66s)]
*  I find his analysis compelling or I did at the time I heard it, but think about our situation [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2328.38s)]
*  We still have an inverted yield curve. It's the most inverted. It's been I think this is the longest. It's been inverted [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2334.18s)]
*  Now the Fed is signaling that we're gonna get two or three more [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2340.14s)]
*  Quarter point rate hike so it's about to become even more [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2343.94s)]
*  Inverted and what that does is it puts incredible pressure on the banking system because the whole banking business model is [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2347.58s)]
*  to borrow short which is [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2353.7799999999997s)]
*  From depositors and lend long and if short rates are higher than long rates that whole business model doesn't work [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2356.38s)]
*  so either they can't engage in lending activities meaning there's a credit crunch or [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2361.8599999999997s)]
*  Deposits leave the system and then that's happening too. So any business out there that's dependent on credit the real estate [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2368.38s)]
*  industry or auto industry [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2376.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean any industry that depends on loans and credit they're gonna continue to be hammered by this so I mean [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2378.3s)]
*  To your point sex. I'll just read the minute commentary on this the meeting did include a discussion on the stress on the banking sector and [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2386.42s)]
*  economic activity in general because of decreased lending [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2394.94s)]
*  Participants generally noted that banking stresses had receded and conditions in the banking sector were much improved since March [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2398.42s)]
*  Participants generally continue to judge that a tightening and credit conditions [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2404.38s)]
*  Spurred by banking sector stress earlier in the year would likely weigh further on economic activity [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2407.6600000000003s)]
*  But the extent remained uncertain [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2413.38s)]
*  So obviously a wait-and-see and that they mentioned the credit conditions had not appeared to have tightened significantly beyond what would be expected in response [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2415.06s)]
*  To the monetary policy actions taken since early last year [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2422.1s)]
*  So at this point saying it's a wait-and-see does not seem to have overstretched in terms of credit tightening at this stage [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2425.1800000000003s)]
*  but well [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2431.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean so [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2433.22s)]
*  Here's the thing is that the Fed engaged in an extraordinary intervention a few months ago [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2434.8199999999997s)]
*  to save the banking system with the [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2441.9399999999996s)]
*  Bank term funding program right where they basically said to all the banks that if you have US Treasuries [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2444.2999999999997s)]
*  And I think it also applied to mortgage-backed securities as well [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2451.18s)]
*  We will we will basically take all of those assets and give you par value will give you a hundred [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2454.02s)]
*  Cents on the dollar yeah in exchange for I guess you have to pay you the bank would have to pay the [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2459.94s)]
*  the one year I [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2466.82s)]
*  Think it was the what what the 12-month interest rate with like 10 10 base points something like that [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2469.34s)]
*  So if you're sitting on bonds that have gone down 20 or 30 percent in value [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2475.58s)]
*  You can go get all that money back by your presenting to the Fed and then you just have to you know [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2481.06s)]
*  You have to then take the hundred cents on the dollar you get and make sure you loan it out [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2487.5s)]
*  at higher than the one year [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2492.46s)]
*  Interest rate which is around I guess five percent right which you can still do in residential right because [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2495.26s)]
*  Mortgages are still something like they're over seven percent [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2500.86s)]
*  So the Fed has provided a lot of liquidity to the banks through this [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2503.34s)]
*  BT [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2509.86s)]
*  It hasn't helped the [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2512.26s)]
*  Commercial real estate guys. I don't think that's why they're they're still I think huge problems in the commercial real estate sector [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2513.9s)]
*  But the Fed did engage in a huge intervention to save the banking system and they may not be done with that yet [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2521.06s)]
*  You got so I just wonder yeah, you know [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2527.82s)]
*  I just wonder if the if you didn't have all these distortions [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2529.86s)]
*  What are the real shape of the economy be you know another one on the side? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2533.5s)]
*  On this on the fiscal side was the whole [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2537.06s)]
*  Binds energy bill which was supposed to be 350 billion [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2540.0200000000004s)]
*  But as our energy investor friends are saying it's probably gonna be more like a trillion when they add it all up [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2543.6600000000003s)]
*  No, but that's honestly hold on those guys are being hyperbolic [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2548.3s)]
*  And they're just stupid and wrong because I know which friends they are [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2551.3s)]
*  And I know them to be mostly stupid and mostly wrong most of the time look the the good thing to know about oh my god [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2555.5s)]
*  I'm getting I'm gonna get a text after this well [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2561.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you should because he doesn't know the fuck he's talking about and he keeps saying there's a lot of stimulus is the point [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2564.0200000000004s)]
*  Whether it's half a billion. Sorry half a trillion or a trillion [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2568.3s)]
*  He's just talking he's just talking his book [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2571.98s)]
*  But where can I just go back to where you're fundamentally right and where I think both of us can can be in unison on this [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2573.82s)]
*  Which is there is a looming credit crisis in the United States and you know, we we've talked about this before [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2581.46s)]
*  I tweeted something a few weeks ago [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2588.1400000000003s)]
*  but the the the debt wall that corporate America is about to hit is pretty meaningful and [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2590.5s)]
*  To your point David a lot of these companies will have to thread a needle because if rates don't go down [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2598.38s)]
*  Materially in the next 18 to 24 months [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2603.98s)]
*  These folks are going to be paying rates that they cannot [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2606.86s)]
*  bear [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2610.1400000000003s)]
*  And they'll probably go into still breach a covenant of some of the debt [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2611.6200000000003s)]
*  So, you know one thing that's important here is that there's some very strict guidelines and covenants that debt [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2615.9s)]
*  Issuers sign up for and one of them is you know, how much debt can I have as a percentage and or as a multiple of? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2622.42s)]
*  My EBITDA and so that's the way that bondholders govern the risk that you don't overborrow [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2628.7400000000002s)]
*  Now the problem is if you have a ratings, you know an earnings recession and or rates go up [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2634.46s)]
*  You can get one of these two things to go wrong and all of a sudden now you have [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2639.78s)]
*  Seven or eight times your EBITDA and you're in a very very bad state [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2643.54s)]
*  So I do think that that that's possible [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2647.5s)]
*  But at the same time I don't think that that's a calamity that touches the entire economy [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2650.14s)]
*  I think there are a whole portfolio of over levered companies in real estate and [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2654.3s)]
*  There's a whole portfolio of over levered companies in private equity [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2658.74s)]
*  those folks will have to get recapped and [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2662.26s)]
*  That will probably cost trillions of dollars of capital impairment [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2665.9s)]
*  But I do think that that can relatively be done without impairing the the economy with March [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2669.46s)]
*  I'll make a prediction right now [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2673.78s)]
*  My prediction is the federal government is gonna help to monetize that debt and [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2675.54s)]
*  They're gonna help to support that commercial real estate sector through some sort of structured lending program. I don't see why do you think that? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2679.7s)]
*  Why do you think because because of the donors because I think that there's a significant amount of capital that gets donated [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2686.66s)]
*  So you think there's gonna be a time for like program for real estate private equity a real estate [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2692.62s)]
*  Tarp, no, you think there's gonna be a tarp like program for real estate assets and for private. I'll take the other side of that [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2698.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'll say real estate assets. I don't know about the private equity assets [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2704.84s)]
*  But I think for the real estate asset just because so much of it is hell [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2707.5400000000004s)]
*  Let's bet it and I'll tell you I'll tell you thousand to the SPCA. Yeah, I'll do that. Oh wait. What's the time frame? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2709.92s)]
*  Maybe you do tell me you want to let in it. No, we'll do it until the Fed starts [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2715.8s)]
*  No until the Fed starts producing rates. So once the Fed does their first rate cut, that's the end of our battle [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2720.84s)]
*  Wow, that's an easy one. I'm in I'm in for 25 [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2725.8s)]
*  I take a hundred [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2730.6400000000003s)]
*  For the SPCA myself for the SPCA for a second, can I just take the action for myself? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2732.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm doing it for the dogs. Yeah [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2739.3199999999997s)]
*  You know Friedberg on that. Oh, sorry. Let me just let me just tell you why sorry [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2741.8399999999997s)]
*  In addition to the significant donor dollars that come from real estate [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2746.16s)]
*  to politicians campaigns [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2750.44s)]
*  But so much of those assets so many of those assets are held in life insurance companies on banks balance sheets [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2753.56s)]
*  I mean you guys may have seen this report this week that because of the rise in interest rates [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2760.2799999999997s)]
*  There are several insurance companies that now be tech may be technically insolvent according to DOI Department of Insurance regs in their respective states [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2764.08s)]
*  Because the impairment on the bond portfolio has declined as caused them to now not have enough capital reserves [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2772.2s)]
*  To pay out the claims they have so the same I think ultimately will come true once you have to do a mark-to-market [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2778.9199999999996s)]
*  on all these real estate assets [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2784.16s)]
*  That there's a significant number of those real estate assets that are held in pension funds that are held in life insurance companies [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2786.92s)]
*  That are held as securities in large pools of capital that are meant to support people's long-term [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2792.12s)]
*  Needs and the government isn't gonna let the federal government isn't gonna let that [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2797.52s)]
*  You know just get written down and have people's future pensions or insurance claims [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2801.8s)]
*  You know get hampered [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2806.92s)]
*  So that's why I think there's gonna be a moment or two where there's gonna be some step in and some structured program to support [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2808.36s)]
*  This I just don't think it's that draconian rates are not that high [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2814.0s)]
*  You know, we're still talking about a 10-year that's flirting with 4% [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2817.52s)]
*  And the fact I'm just talking about commercial real estate because there's also a demand problem, right? Yeah [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2821.1600000000003s)]
*  I know but the the other side of this is [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2825.8s)]
*  The trend again, there is no doubt [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2829.92s)]
*  Oversupply and a problem particularly in a place like San Francisco where we're gonna see some blow-ups because nobody wants to you know [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2833.56s)]
*  To enter a long-term lease in a city that's under siege [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2840.12s)]
*  I understand that but the fact is that the market is telling you that rates are gonna start going down [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2844.04s)]
*  Right that the feds gonna come in battle until the edge, right? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2853.04s)]
*  And then they're going you know, feds are gonna come rates are gonna come down a little bit [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2856.68s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2860.12s)]
*  Because if they have two more quarter point rate increases now you have restrictive rates at something like 200 basis points [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2861.16s)]
*  That's higher than the Fed wants that's the foot really hard on the break [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2867.84s)]
*  So it's not like the markets crazy and thinking that we're going to have a couple rate cuts next year [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2871.8s)]
*  I just told you in 2000 we went from 6% to 2001 ending the year at 1.75% [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2876.7200000000003s)]
*  And the Fed was doing the exact same jawboning in the summer of 2000 [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2882.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay, so they they do evolve rate policy based upon what's happening in the economy [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2887.32s)]
*  All of the things are rolling over CPI is rolling over Jolt's is rolling over etc. So again, I just don't see the heightened [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2893.94s)]
*  Concern I think to the bank issue sacks to me that was you know, that was the much scarier [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2902.46s)]
*  Concern Druckenmiller actually pulled forward his hard landing [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2909.5800000000004s)]
*  Expectation to q2 of this year as a result of the bank crisis and now has pushed it back out to q4 of this year [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2914.1000000000004s)]
*  I think if we have another, you know black swan like banks or something that I can't foresee today [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2921.18s)]
*  Then you know that could certainly be the thing that would be the catalyst to toss us into a hard landing [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2928.06s)]
*  Barring that I think that by the way [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2934.14s)]
*  The probabilities the fat part of the curve is that we have a softish medium, you know sort of landing here [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2937.8599999999997s)]
*  I think you're right. I think you're right. And by the way, like if if the UK had not [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2943.58s)]
*  Left Europe [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2949.5s)]
*  Then the whole contagion of Europe [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2951.86s)]
*  Could be one of those black swan events that we would all be talking about as theoretically possible [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2955.26s)]
*  But it looks like the UK is [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2961.78s)]
*  probably gonna [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2965.02s)]
*  It's really bad [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2966.5s)]
*  I think [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2967.9s)]
*  Britain is now the only major economy where inflation is still rising the the OECD said Tuesday that you're in your inflation in the [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2968.62s)]
*  G7 fell to four point six percent in May down from you know, five percent in April [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2974.94s)]
*  So inflation is is tempering a bit but UK consumer prices rose to seven point nine percent in May [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2979.62s)]
*  Which is up from seven point eight percent in April. So an acceleration [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2987.58s)]
*  In the UK, it seems like it's a pretty nasty spiral problem [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2991.7400000000002s)]
*  This is where you know the benefit of being part of a larger economy [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2995.5s)]
*  Really pays dividends, right? Obviously there's a lot to do with you know language and currency [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=2999.54s)]
*  There's a whole bunch of issues rolled up into why the UK left the European Union [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3004.66s)]
*  But my gosh, one of the real obvious advantages is you know, you're smoothing out the variants [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3009.2599999999998s)]
*  Right and smoothing out variants is really valuable. So if you think about like all of these economies in Europe [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3015.2599999999998s)]
*  You know like [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3023.8999999999996s)]
*  PMS in a hedge fund, right Brad? You can you know, you know this it's like you you sometimes some guy crushes it [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3025.42s)]
*  You know, look how Millennium or? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3032.7s)]
*  SAC or [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3035.22s)]
*  Citadel makes the real money. It's by smoothing out variants and [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3036.7999999999997s)]
*  That's a great thing about being part of an economic union like the EU offers and in the absence of that in times like this [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3041.2599999999998s)]
*  Is it really exposes the weaknesses of a small subscale economic system, which unfortunately the UK has? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3048.14s)]
*  Right. The church Europe is going into recession, too [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3055.54s)]
*  I mean Germany has huge problems that again stems from the cutoff of cheap Russian gas [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3058.94s)]
*  Economies in the EU they're going into recession as well [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3065.58s)]
*  So it's not it's not what this not with the same levels of inflation [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3068.26s)]
*  My point is like, you know, it's one thing for an economy to start to recede but here it's you don't [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3071.46s)]
*  Have the benefit of balance sheet borrowing of the scale of the EU nor do you have the disinflation of the EU? [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3078.54s)]
*  And I think that's problematic much more for the UK than it is for any individual country in Europe, that's just my point [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3085.6600000000003s)]
*  That's all [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3091.42s)]
*  Can I can I you know one just philosophical thought you know, because if we rewind the clock to the beginning of the year [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3092.42s)]
*  You know, there was absolute consensus in the markets [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3099.02s)]
*  Right and you can go back and look at all the headlines Mike Wilson's consensus [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3102.46s)]
*  Was that we were gonna have a hard landing in q1 hedge funds long only funds had their exposure super low [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3107.1000000000004s)]
*  Everybody had post-traumatic stress from last year [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3114.58s)]
*  It is a sure strategy to lose a lot of money or not make money [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3117.58s)]
*  If you're trying to always call the market as though, you know, you have no idea [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3122.74s)]
*  Right q1 and q2 sure there was a possibility we could have a hard landing [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3128.22s)]
*  Right and the bank crisis made that look as though as a possibility. What we try to do is look at that distribution of [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3133.38s)]
*  Possibilities right it's a distribution curve and so I put up on the on the screen here what the markets implied [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3140.18s)]
*  Fed fund rate changes are from today [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3148.5s)]
*  So what the market is betting on which from my perspective is better than any one of us trying to forecast [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3151.46s)]
*  Right what's gonna happen with future rate increases? It's saying yeah [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3158.06s)]
*  We're going to go from five point zero eight percent today to something like peaking at five point four five percent [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3161.54s)]
*  November of this year and then at some point beyond November could be December could be q1 of next year [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3168.1s)]
*  Right. We'll see enough turning over of CPI [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3175.82s)]
*  Enough turning over of jolts that now will say the balance of risk has shifted to being too punitive on the economy [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3179.18s)]
*  So we're gonna reel back in one of those rate increases [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3187.22s)]
*  Okay, and I think that you know, so Friedberg just to clarify on the bet [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3190.38s)]
*  We just made which I'm excited about you have to have this tarp, you know commercial real estate rescue program before [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3195.48s)]
*  They reel back one of those rate increases which the markets telling you could be as early as December [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3202.28s)]
*  Yeah, but I encourage everybody who listens, you know, like don't listen [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3207.16s)]
*  You know [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3212.08s)]
*  It's not like go all in because Druckenmiller says hard landing or don't go all in soft landing because we say soft landing [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3212.64s)]
*  All right [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3218.88s)]
*  Our net exposure has come down over the course of the year at altimeter [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3219.6s)]
*  Because we've moved the markets have moved up a lot. They're pricing in more of a soft landing today [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3224.04s)]
*  So the idea is to have high exposures when the world's panic and then to reel in your exposures a little bit [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3229.64s)]
*  But never be all or none. I mean the the fascination with calling the big short the big hard landing soft landing [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3236.0s)]
*  It's just a sure way not to make much money [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3242.1s)]
*  Today there was a red hot [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3245.56s)]
*  US jobs report Brad US job openings dropped below 10 million in May [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3249.2400000000002s)]
*  But the labor market remains piping hot. Like I said, you know the market I think is you know, it's it's reading way too much [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3254.68s)]
*  I mean, it's wasn't even a I mean we'll get the official [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3262.36s)]
*  Jobs numbers out of the out of the federal government tomorrow. This was an ADP report [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3265.32s)]
*  Which are have been not particularly good, but I are already explained. There's a rationale [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3270.0s)]
*  Look peel behind the G the ADP report [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3276.32s)]
*  250,000 of the 400 and you know thousand odd jobs that were created were in hospitality and leisure [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3281.36s)]
*  I mean these were desperately needed because we have a peak summer travel season going on [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3286.7599999999998s)]
*  So you have hotels that hire a bunch of people those show up in the ADP job numbers, right? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3291.32s)]
*  But the great news is the Joltz job openings goes go down and you know [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3296.38s)]
*  Summers was complaining last year that Joltz wasn't going down fast enough. He also said something that was really interesting [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3300.68s)]
*  When Joltz [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3308.2s)]
*  When he said when Joltz goes down by over 10% [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3309.8799999999997s)]
*  So think we've had a move from 12 million to nine point eight million. He said when Joe goes down by over 10% [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3313.2799999999997s)]
*  We have a reduction or an increase in the unemployment rate by two and a half percent in the subsequent 12 months [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3320.56s)]
*  So Joltz is a leading indicator [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3328.4s)]
*  You got a real in those job openings and then you start seeing unemployment bump up [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3330.56s)]
*  So with a tight economy, you know the foot on the feds foot on on rates some of the contraction that day that sax has [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3334.76s)]
*  Been pointing out and then we start to see these early indicators in Joltz [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3342.04s)]
*  I mean people need the job clearly or they wouldn't have taken them their STEMI has run out [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3346.36s)]
*  All of these things are are what the Fed is trying to manufacture, right? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3351.04s)]
*  I don't look at that jobs number. In fact, we were doing just the opposite [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3355.68s)]
*  You know in the market this morning to you know what the market was giving us [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3359.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't I don't think that was a very good read through at all. Okay. I want to talk a little bit about jobs [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3363.7999999999997s)]
*  the Florida State Senate bill 1718 [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3369.24s)]
*  Went into effect on July 1st [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3374.04s)]
*  This bill now requires that any company with more than 25 employees [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3376.3599999999997s)]
*  Use the e-verify system to verify the legal immigration status of their workers of their employees and [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3382.04s)]
*  This will create a real impact on [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3389.72s)]
*  businesses that employ more than [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3394.52s)]
*  800,000 illegal immigrants in the state of Florida [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3397.88s)]
*  To do a lot of work and a lot of labor [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3401.08s)]
*  It's unclear how many of those eight hundred thousand illegal immigrants that are working in Florida today are [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3403.0s)]
*  Working at a firm with more than 25 employees [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3409.12s)]
*  But the impact is going to range from the construction industry to farm labor [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3412.16s)]
*  And a lot of other manual labor [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3417.72s)]
*  sectors [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3420.48s)]
*  In a state that has 2.3% unemployment [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3421.72s)]
*  DeSantis has made this, you know an important speaking topic when he's spoken publicly [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3425.84s)]
*  He did quite a bit of press around the passage of this bill as a way to counter Biden's quote open immigration policy [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3431.52s)]
*  Sax I know that you've talked about DeSantis in the past [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3438.48s)]
*  Do you have a read on the impact that this immigration policy will have do you agree with it would love your thoughts? I [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3441.2400000000002s)]
*  Mean, I don't think this is a [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3449.36s)]
*  Jobs bill. This is a immigration bill or it's an immigration issue and [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3451.4s)]
*  Look, I don't know what the impact on Florida is gonna be from this. I don't trust a single [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3457.92s)]
*  Story that's out of I guess there's just a story in the Wall Street Journal about it [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3463.52s)]
*  I mean this feels like a campaign story. So [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3466.84s)]
*  I want to see more stories before I reach the termination on what the impact is gonna be but [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3469.5600000000004s)]
*  Politically, do I think this is smart? Yeah, because the border is the number one issue in the country right now [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3475.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't think you guys are as [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3482.0s)]
*  Clued in to like how on fire the country is about what's going on at the border fundraiser [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3485.0s)]
*  RFK talked about the the border because he went there. There's a bunch of really good clips online [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3491.32s)]
*  I [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3496.84s)]
*  Don't care who you are. You can't listen to that accounting. It's just an accounting, right? So anybody could do it [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3498.2400000000002s)]
*  So it doesn't matter what your political [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3505.5600000000004s)]
*  Perspective is on RFK anybody who listens to that accounting can't be anything but shocked [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3509.48s)]
*  What he described is what our case described is he went to the border at Yuma and there are literally holes in the wall [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3517.44s)]
*  You know from Trump's wall and [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3525.1s)]
*  Literally the building materials to finish the wall and plug those holes are sitting there on the ground and the Biden administration refuses to [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3527.54s)]
*  Use them and plug the hole because they don't want to give any credit to Trump presumably [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3535.42s)]
*  I mean literally that's how petty it is or it's actually their policy. They actually like having an open border [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3540.08s)]
*  so something like seven million legals have come in through the southern border since by and spent an office and [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3546.2999999999997s)]
*  They're not and they're not they're not from Central America it turns out these folks are from [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3552.94s)]
*  Eastern Europe and Africa predominantly many men at military age [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3558.62s)]
*  And it's an entire business that's run by the cartels and as he describes it. It's it's really just [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3564.38s)]
*  Plainly shocking [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3571.34s)]
*  One of our if one of our enemies wanted to get thousands of sleeper [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3573.58s)]

*  Okay, can I can I just think about that? Um, yeah, I get it. Yeah [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3582.38s)]
*  Can I pivot away from the border policy question to one of labor? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3585.1800000000003s)]
*  We obviously as evidenced by the jobs report from ADP this morning [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3589.7400000000002s)]
*  remain in a very tight labor market in the u.s and we as a group often talk about h1bs and the importance of [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3594.46s)]
*  Allowing educated immigrants into this country to meet our our knowledge workforce needs [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3600.94s)]
*  But there obviously is a pretty sizable manual labor workforce need in this country and a very tight labor market to fulfill that need [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3607.02s)]
*  Ranging from construction where we have, you know deep [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3613.9s)]

*  For those businesses to meet their economic objective to be able to be profitable and we simply may not have enough of a [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3629.9s)]
*  labor force [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3636.46s)]

*  Is it that we are supposed to take anyone that's illegal in the country? [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3644.3s)]
*  And make it impossible for them to work here [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3648.54s)]
*  And is that not going to have a very adverse effect on these important segments of our economy that today rely on? [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3651.18s)]
*  That labor force [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3658.62s)]
*  That is here illegally [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3660.14s)]
*  And i'm not listening. I think I'm not stating an opinion. I'm asking the like the important [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3661.82s)]
*  I get what you're saying. I think we can start to resolve that issue when you solve the border crisis [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3665.42s)]
*  The problem is the average american doesn't want to hear anything about [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3670.46s)]
*  You know quote-unquote comprehensive solutions to the border crisis or immigration or what do you want? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3673.82s)]
*  I'm not talking about politics. I'm not talking i'm just talking about your personal point of view [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3680.78s)]
*  My personal point of view is we need to seal the borders. So we stop having this problem [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3685.26s)]
*  Okay, but what about the work? What about the labor? Yeah, yeah, let me uh, i'll take a crack at it free bird [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3689.58s)]
*  Okay, i'm just trying to i'm trying to diagnose the difference between the the border policy question and the real economic question [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3694.7799999999997s)]
*  I know the california ag sector very well. There's an important migrant visa [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3701.34s)]
*  um that the entire farming economy depends on in the california and um, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3706.14s)]
*  These are illegal immigrants that are legally allowed to work in the farming sector [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3710.86s)]
*  And it allows farms to be able to do the work they need to do because there is absolutely no labor to do that work without [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3715.18s)]
*  This immigrant population [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3721.34s)]
*  And there's other elements of this that are critical across the economy. Sorry brad. Go ahead [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3723.34s)]
*  No, so why why can't we have a common sense migrant? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3727.02s)]
*  You know worker program worker visa, you know predicated on that right? [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3730.22s)]
*  The problem is I think where you know, most people are in agreement [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3734.54s)]
*  That if you have a relatively secure border, right then you design good policies [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3739.1s)]
*  we should have a policy for people who want to come and work and earn some money and [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3744.3s)]
*  You know, we we have job openings in this country and then return home, right? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3749.66s)]
*  Or go through a normal process, right to get in line to citizenship. But the problem is people [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3755.02s)]
*  cutting the line [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3762.2200000000003s)]
*  You know skipping the system and given the social safety nets that states on the border have lined up and we as a [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3763.66s)]
*  You know a nation have lined up that's just unsustainable in a world where we're already whatever 35 trillion dollars in debt [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3770.86s)]
*  So I think these things can coexist you can [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3777.82s)]
*  Treat labor humanely you can create a safe harbor for labor to come to the country [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3780.94s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that you should just have holes in the wall and anybody who wants to come here can come here in whatever capacity [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3787.02s)]
*  they want [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3793.02s)]
*  Chamath assuming that the border is closed and we fix that problem [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3794.3s)]
*  What do you think the right solution is to the millions of illegal immigrants that are residing? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3798.62s)]
*  I'll answer that but let me let me ask you a question. Do you think we should seal the border? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3803.34s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. And why do you think we should seal the border? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3807.26s)]
*  So that we have a system that we can use to manage the flow of labor and decide what's appropriate for our country [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3811.26s)]
*  And we can actually have a conversation about what qualifies someone to come across the border and to immigrate into the us [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3816.78s)]
*  I totally agree with you. Yeah, I agree. I think that looks like but [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3823.98s)]
*  Saying that you assume that the border was sealed. What would you do about you know, low-skill immigration? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3828.54s)]
*  That's kind of like asking other than that. How is the play mrs. Lincoln? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3834.86s)]
*  I mean, this is the hair on fire political issue is that we can't get the border sealed [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3838.78s)]
*  That you've had [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3843.7400000000002s)]
*  7 million plus illegals come across it [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3844.94s)]
*  during the biden administration [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3848.38s)]
*  And the administration obviously doesn't have the will to do anything about it [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3850.62s)]
*  So you're kind of assuming away the central issue [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3854.86s)]
*  This is the issue one of the main main issues. I got trump-elected in 2016 was building the wall [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3859.5s)]
*  No, but I think wait, I think we're all saying that hasn't gone away. We need to seal the border [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3863.9s)]
*  We're all saying that right? Does anybody think we shouldn't seal the border? No, I agree [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3868.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think we all yeah [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3872.2200000000003s)]
*  But then why isn't the analysis on why that doesn't happen when everyone in the country agrees that should happen to just about everybody? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3873.42s)]
*  But I do think that there's a that there's a low-scale labor market need that's not met in this country. There isn't a public restaurant [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3878.7000000000003s)]
*  Um company that doesn't talk about the challenges that they're having with labor. They cannot fill the jobs that they well [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3885.1800000000003s)]
*  Let me all right if you want to talk about that issue [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3891.66s)]
*  I want to flag a report that was presented to congress and this is about 15 years old back in 2007 [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3893.42s)]
*  By heritage, but I don't think the numbers have changed much in the interim. In fact, they've probably gotten worse. Um [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3900.06s)]
*  The point that this researcher made is that if you look at the cost of low-skill immigration [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3905.18s)]
*  the average low-skill immigrant household receives [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3912.2999999999997s)]
*  Approximately thirty thousand dollars in direct benefits from the government by contrast these households only pay about ten thousand dollars [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3916.54s)]
*  in taxes [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3924.38s)]
*  so even though [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3925.74s)]
*  Those low-skill immigrant households, let's assume that they're working and do contribute to the economy in the way that you're saying [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3927.9s)]
*  there's still [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3934.86s)]
*  a twenty thousand dollar gap [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3936.86s)]
*  between [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3939.42s)]
*  Uh what they contribute and what they receive from the government and that is a big problem for [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3940.7s)]
*  the country [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3946.54s)]
*  My guess is that the counter argument would be that more than twenty thousand dollars of economic benefit [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3947.74s)]
*  Accrues to the businesses that employ that labor because they can now be profitable [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3953.5s)]
*  They can now get the work done that they need to do they can grow their revenue [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3958.06s)]
*  They can expand their footprint [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3961.5s)]
*  They can service their customers all the things that otherwise they might not be able to do without having access to that [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3963.02s)]
*  I think that's a big assumption. I think that's a big assumption one of the problems [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3968.22s)]
*  With the system that we have is that there's a lot of government benefits, right? [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3972.4599999999996s)]
*  And it and so if you want to have a more open immigration policy [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3977.2599999999998s)]
*  That's sort of inconsistent with the idea of having a super generous. No, I think I think yeah [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3982.8599999999997s)]
*  I think there there are three distinct things [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3987.3399999999997s)]
*  One is is it open or closed and you know second if it's closed [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3989.18s)]
*  What are the qualification criteria and how many and I think that's totally reasonable [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3992.2999999999997s)]
*  The third is what benefit what government benefits are provided and you could reduce the government benefits if it's too costly [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=3995.98s)]
*  you could improve the qualification criteria and increase the number of of [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4001.34s)]
*  You know, I know folks that are coming in. I know this may sound crazy, but [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4005.7400000000002s)]
*  I think that tying together immigration and jobs [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4009.34s)]
*  um [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4012.94s)]
*  Is like the best way to ensure that nothing actually happens on immigration, right? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4014.3s)]
*  and what I mean by that is that when you go to a restaurant for example, and [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4019.26s)]
*  The service has decayed because they can't they can't get enough staff [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4023.6600000000003s)]
*  right [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4028.7000000000003s)]
*  You don't walk out of that restaurant thinking well, wow, we need comprehensive immigration reform [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4030.7000000000003s)]
*  You say thumbs down on yelp. I'm never going back here again [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4036.06s)]
*  And so unfortunately, if it's that if it's service sector jobs in particular, by the way [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4040.86s)]
*  There is no closed loop way where you actually tie these two issues together [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4047.34s)]
*  and so [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4053.02s)]
*  The issue becomes stranded which is what it has which is why I think what [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4054.46s)]
*  Brad said and sac said is right, which is there's an order of operations here where the american people [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4058.6200000000003s)]
*  probably want [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4064.36s)]
*  an immigration system that says something like [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4066.06s)]
*  Here's some you know a point-based approach right where we try to attract the world's best think about it like a draft [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4069.6600000000003s)]
*  Right and we want to attract the world's best athletes to come play on our team team america team usa [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4076.1400000000003s)]
*  We have all of the capabilities to do that [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4082.86s)]
*  But before we do that, we have to kind of close the border and I think that that's the only way it's ever going to get [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4085.9s)]
*  done [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4090.1400000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4090.94s)]
*  The problem with the job thing is a bit of red herring towards immigration because people just don't tie the two things together practically speaking [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4092.1400000000003s)]
*  Well, I was going to say one final point on this is that when you admit lots of low-skill immigration [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4098.7s)]
*  Or labor into the country you're creating wage pressure [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4104.38s)]
*  for americans at the lowest end of the totem pole [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4107.42s)]
*  And that is why they are so resistant to it. This is why [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4111.34s)]
*  average working-class americans are [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4114.7s)]
*  Very upset about the border. It's also a security issue and there's drugs pouring across as well [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4117.74s)]
*  You know the fentanyl crisis that we see but it creates a lot of wage pressure for americans who are at the lowest end of the [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4123.74s)]
*  the latter [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4130.22s)]
*  I mean, what's wrong with just paying them a little bit more, you know, so so here's some statistics for you guys [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4131.66s)]
*  The total population of unauthorized immigrants in the u.s. Peaked in in 2007 has declined slightly since [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4137.42s)]
*  California felt it first from 2010 to 2018 the unauthorized immigrant population in the state declined by 10% [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4144.52s)]
*  To 2.6 million mostly impacting the farm economy [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4150.38s)]
*  um, so the state california state reports [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4154.38s)]
*  That from 2010 to 2020 the average number of workers hired by california farms for crop production [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4157.66s)]
*  Declined to 150 000 from 170 000. I talk with a lot of people in the farm economy as you guys know [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4163.099999999999s)]
*  And this is an endemic problem in california agriculture is that the lack of a labor force that [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4169.42s)]
*  Allows the farms to be profitable is really impacting folks ability to operate and to grow and you know [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4175.74s)]
*  That ultimately translates into consumer prices and so on so there are huge consequences [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4181.74s)]
*  As to having effectively an open border policy that go beyond [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4186.38s)]
*  Just you know farms or you know vineyards not being able to hire enough cheap labor [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4190.38s)]
*  I mean look at what's going on in france right now. Yeah, you've basically got [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4195.58s)]
*  riots you've got a [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4199.32s)]
*  Civil war going on. There's a large unassimilated poor immigrant population in that country [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4201.18s)]
*  That's where open borders gets you. That's the end result. So there are huge consequences to [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4207.0199999999995s)]
*  Allowing in huge numbers of low skilled immigrants [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4212.38s)]
*  Yeah, especially illegal ones [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4215.26s)]
*  I don't think there's a lot this is where we get to you know last week [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4217.58s)]
*  We had the canada h1b and announcement about their technomatic visa program and I sent it to two members of congress [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4221.900000000001s)]
*  I sent a tweet that I just just recap for us what happened brett. Okay. So in canada last week [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4228.9400000000005s)]
*  Um, you know the government announced an aggressive push to recruit [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4234.780000000001s)]
*  Uh technology workers from around the world to canada so they made it easier [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4239.26s)]
*  For uh tech workers to get what they are calling a digital nomad visa [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4244.22s)]
*  So you can now go and work [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4250.94s)]
*  You know in canada, uh, if you have a job offer and then they also in kind of a gangster move [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4254.139999999999s)]
*  Um said if you already have an h1b visa in the united states and it's starting to run out [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4260.62s)]
*  Just bring you and your family to canada and work from here, right? [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4265.18s)]
*  So it was like we've been talking about we need h1b visa reform [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4269.34s)]
*  We need to recruit the world's best and brightest and artificial intelligence, etc to the united states and they were you know [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4273.58s)]
*  They were doing it quite aggressively. Now. The point is I sent that to two members of congress [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4279.820000000001s)]
*  A democrat member of the house a republican member of the senate and I got back nearly identical answers from both of them [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4285.1s)]
*  They said no chance that happens here dead on arrival because nothing's going to move until we have a comprehensive [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4291.900000000001s)]
*  immigration [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4298.54s)]
*  Policy in this country and then I said well, why isn't that happening? [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4299.84s)]
*  They said elections, right? Show me the incentives and i'll show you the outcome. The problem is all four of us agree [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4304.0s)]
*  we should have [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4310.64s)]
*  You know, we should have sealed borders, but at the same time immigration is what makes this country great [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4312.24s)]
*  We want to treat people humanely. We need migrant workers like this is not that hard a problem [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4317.52s)]
*  Uh to solve in this country, but there's not even a conversation the farce that is washington dc on this topic [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4323.12s)]
*  Is there's not even an honest conversation or attempt to get to an ass to get to a solution here [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4330.400000000001s)]
*  So with a presidential election, you know less than you know, uh a year and a half away [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4337.12s)]
*  We're just back to the same old tribal war that we've had before now [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4343.12s)]
*  I understand sac's point is like listen nothing happens until [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4346.64s)]
*  We have closed borders and maybe sequentially that's what we have to do [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4350.879999999999s)]
*  But it doesn't stop there. I think we all agree that what makes this country special is that we you know [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4355.44s)]
*  Fourth of july, you know, we throw open the doors and we welcome [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4362.5599999999995s)]
*  Uh, you know folks from around the world to contribute to this great experiment [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4367.04s)]
*  Some of them are on a path to citizenship and some of them are not [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4371.2s)]
*  What doesn't sit right with anybody is breaking the rules and skipping the line [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4374.879999999999s)]
*  I understand the desperation and the motivation of some people to do that [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4379.599999999999s)]
*  But that is not ever going to be a system that works for the majority [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4383.92s)]
*  So it sounds like why is that happening? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4388.24s)]
*  What the reason that's happening is right sex. Yes. Yes the way I interpret [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4390.32s)]
*  Listen when you say that we can't do anything until we have comprehensive immigration reform by the way I heard [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4396.0s)]
*  future [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4402.5599999999995s)]
*  Democratic nominee Gavin Newsom say the same thing on Hannity [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4403.68s)]
*  What the party in power is doing is holding the country hostage and saying that we're not going to close the border [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4407.4400000000005s)]
*  We're going to use the the border as a bargaining chip [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4413.84s)]
*  Until you give us the immigration package that we want but that really shouldn't be allowed because really it's the obligation of the federal government [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4417.84s)]
*  To have a secure border. That's not something you trade. That's something that we should already have [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4425.200000000001s)]
*  That's what we pay for [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4430.32s)]
*  That's what we pay for [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4431.84s)]
*  So that when they talk about comprehensive immigration reform, that's basically what they're saying is we're not going to give you a secure border [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4433.2s)]
*  until you give us enough policies that we want just to give you guys the [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4438.64s)]
*  and and freeburg and sax are immigrants, but you guys [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4443.76s)]
*  Got your citizenship through your parents [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4448.08s)]
*  Um, I actually did the process myself as an a tn visa holder [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4450.8s)]
*  Who then went to an h1b? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4455.84s)]
*  Um, why then I think went to eb1 [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4458.24s)]
*  So, you know, i've had to go through this [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4461.4400000000005s)]
*  And i've literally had to wait in line [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4464.64s)]
*  And you you can't I can't describe to you [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4467.2s)]
*  the anxiety you have [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4470.4800000000005s)]
*  When you know, you know your visa is running out [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4472.56s)]
*  you're waiting for [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4475.6s)]
*  customs and integration to basically give you the meeting so that they can actually approve or [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4477.4400000000005s)]
*  Tell you that your h1b is approved or your eb1 is approved [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4482.88s)]
*  And you go to this website, it's arcane you refresh it every day you do it for six months straight every day a few times a day [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4486.4800000000005s)]
*  You go into the forums where all these other immigrants are talking about how frustrated they are and how scared they are [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4495.04s)]
*  But we all stood in line [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4500.08s)]
*  And I think what people don't understand who think that the southern border should be totally open [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4503.92s)]
*  Is is the anxiety that those of us who actually played by the rules went through? [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4508.88s)]
*  For months and in some cases if you come from countries like india and china years, right by the way, that's not fair [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4514.64s)]
*  What you're saying is exactly why the hispanic population the hispanic citizens of the united states are increasingly voting republican [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4522.16s)]
*  Because they have gone through the process [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4531.2s)]
*  they have suffered the the rigmarole and they don't want to see an open border policy that um, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4533.28s)]
*  You know isn't fair and doesn't feel right, you know, we're first generation [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4539.759999999999s)]
*  Americans and I remember when my parents went through the process [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4543.34s)]
*  I think my dad got a green card based on being a doctor before we came here and then after five years [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4546.719999999999s)]
*  Became citizens. It seemed a lot more orderly back then by the way, totally the process just seemed to work [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4552.16s)]
*  I've seen all the statistics showing the insane percentage of silicon valley startups that had at least one [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4556.8s)]
*  immigrant co-founder it's something like 40 to 50 percent [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4563.82s)]
*  Of unicorn of unicorn companies in silicon valley have at least one co-founder who's first generation [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4568.0s)]
*  American or or an immigrant? So I understand full well the benefits to the country and our economy by [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4573.92s)]
*  Being able to have immigrants come to america, but generally speaking those are high-skilled immigrants [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4581.92s)]
*  And we should be able to have that as a feature of our system without having an open border [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4588.48s)]
*  And the problem is all these things get conflated right now [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4593.76s)]
*  And I think what's happening is it shouldn't be so hard to get extensions to h1bs [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4596.16s)]
*  It is really crazy [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4599.92s)]
*  That we're giving canada this opportunity and that we're potentially driving out really talented high school workers [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4601.92s)]
*  But the problem right now is that the southern border is such a mess that the african-american doesn't want to hear anything [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4607.76s)]
*  about h1bs or [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4613.2s)]
*  Any bring they don't hear about any of it. They're just like I would I would encourage people to [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4615.44s)]
*  To listen to that rfk clip where he describes, you know, and he's one of the rare [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4620.4s)]
*  Presidential candidates that has taken the time and gone down there and he just describes it very plainly [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4626.7s)]
*  So irrespective of what you think of him [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4632.08s)]
*  Uh listen to it because it's pretty factual and it's very scary [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4634.24s)]
*  This seems to me to be of such significant strategic national interests similar to the national debt [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4638.72s)]
*  Um that there really should be a commission of centrist folks [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4646.4800000000005s)]
*  Uh, you know appointed by whatever president this president the next president [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4651.6s)]
*  Um that tries to craft something we can pass break it down into two or three bills [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4656.4800000000005s)]
*  Um, but it you know, this is really undermining our ability to compete in the world [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4662.24s)]
*  And we need to solve this problem and I think we've been discussing this, you know for as long as uh, you know [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4668.16s)]
*  We've been in silicon valley, but certainly it's become an incredible problem in the age of ai, etc [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4675.12s)]
*  and you know, um, you know having the tit for tat of what's going on these news articles shipping off, you know illegal immigrants to [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4681.84s)]
*  Uh to martha's vineyard, you know, I happen to be on martha's vineyard right now. I think they sent 49 [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4691.2s)]
*  You know folks here, uh venezuelan most of them central american and i'll tell you this island is made better because of you know [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4697.12s)]
*  It has a tremendous number of portuguese and central american workers [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4704.72s)]

*  I mean I want to do a just do a quick recap on the whole chinese spy balloon thing [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4915.84s)]
*  I actually think there's a serious [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4919.76s)]
*  Statement here about how our political system works [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4921.820000000001s)]
*  But do you want to tee this up for your burger or do you want me to go for it? Yeah lead in yeah [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4926.0s)]
*  Go for it. All right [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4930.320000000001s)]
*  So basically you guys remember a few months ago that we had this whole chinese spy balloon thing that went on for a week [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4931.280000000001s)]
*  I mean we had 24 7 wall-to-wall cable and use coverage of this thing [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4937.280000000001s)]
*  and [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4942.16s)]
*  the administration was [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4943.12s)]
*  Accused of being soft on china and and allowing the spy balloon to traverse across the united states and people were posting [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4945.36s)]
*  photos [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4954.08s)]
*  Yeah, then finally the the white house deployed some [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4956.48s)]
*  F-16s to shoot down some 16 [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4960.0s)]
*  dollar hobbyist balloons with [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4962.94s)]
*  400 000 sidewinder missiles to show that they were really tough [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4964.64s)]
*  Anyway, it was this whole farce now it turns out that the pentagon just released a statement [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4967.68s)]
*  So pentagon press secretary brigadier general pat rider said the balloon not only did not transmit data back to china and never collected any [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4972.32s)]
*  And he said we're aware that it had intelligence collection capabilities [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4981.76s)]
*  but it has [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4986.96s)]
*  Been our assessment now that it did not collect while it was transiting the united states. So if it [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4988.16s)]
*  Wasn't collecting any data. It wasn't transmitting back to china [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4994.8s)]
*  And then i've also heard that it didn't contain any special equipment at all [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=4999.04s)]
*  It just i've read articles saying that was just standard equipment that you could buy [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5002.16s)]
*  How is it still a spy balloon? [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5006.96s)]
*  Yeah [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5009.2s)]
*  And everybody got worked up about this thing that turned out to be [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5010.16s)]
*  But is it chinese was it actually chinese? I think it was chinese with american technology [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5013.6s)]
*  So so now all the reporting off the shelf equipment [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5019.12s)]
*  Yeah, like now all the reporting is covering the fact that it had quote american technology on it [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5021.2s)]
*  Like sax's point is you could just buy the stuff off the shelf [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5026.96s)]
*  And if you guys remember around the time that it was discovered we talked about this [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5030.719999999999s)]
*  But it wasn't widely covered in the media that there was an upgrade to the domestic radar system [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5035.759999999999s)]
*  Where they increased the resolution and the frequency of capture of these radar images [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5042.24s)]
*  So they were starting to pick up more fine-tuned smaller objects that were otherwise being missed including things like little [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5046.719999999999s)]
*  You know weather balloons or you know stuff that that otherwise wasn't getting paid attention to and that this you know balloon [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5052.959999999999s)]
*  May have been the sort of thing that could have been a blip and ignored [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5059.2s)]
*  In the prior system, but then when they upgraded the system it became a thing and to sax's point [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5062.799999999999s)]
*  What's interesting is how it got spun? [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5066.799999999999s)]
*  Into a you know domestic threat [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5068.959999999999s)]
*  By the chinese well, we had this debate on the pod months ago where I was like look [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5072.0s)]
*  This is just this cannot be true. It's just it makes no sense. I mean the chinese have spy satellites [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5076.16s)]
*  So if they wanted to spy on us, they would just use imaging from space. So then people started speculating. Well, this is this [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5082.48s)]
*  spy balloon must have new kinds of equipment, you know new sensors or [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5089.839999999999s)]
*  Sound maybe they're trying to collect sound patterns make recordings [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5095.5199999999995s)]
*  So in other words over farmland over northern canada and then farmland and yeah [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5100.0s)]
*  Like there's a lot of interesting stuff to pick up there instead of recognizing that the story was completely far-fetched [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5104.799999999999s)]
*  They had to invent a narrative about why it made sense [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5110.259999999999s)]
*  And then you know if you basically raise any questions whatsoever about this narrative [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5114.66s)]
*  They you were looked on as if you were like chinese spokesman like a spy or something sax this this pentagon statement [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5118.98s)]
*  Came right after tony blinken's visit to china, right? [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5126.82s)]
*  He just got back from china [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5130.0199999999995s)]
*  And there was a lot of closed door meetings and then they gave the usual hoopla about what was discussed and there was nothing new [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5131.86s)]
*  That was introduced in the public statement about what was discussed behind the closed doors [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5137.459999999999s)]
*  But do you think that maybe there was something that was negotiated behind closed doors where they said [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5142.179999999999s)]
*  Our this balloon was not a domestic threat. You guys made it out to be you need to make a statement to correct the record [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5147.54s)]
*  Yes, I actually think that's exactly what happened is we know blinken went to china. He had seven hours of meeting meetings the [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5152.82s)]
*  Readout from those meetings said that they were very candid conversations. That's usually diplomatic code for [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5159.94s)]
*  A row of fight [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5166.66s)]
*  Yes, exactly. Exactly [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5168.179999999999s)]
*  And I think I think the chinese were very upset that the story was relentlessly pumped for days and days that they were spying on [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5169.7s)]
*  America and I think they demanded a correction and I think that [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5176.24s)]
*  That is exactly what the pentagon did is they put out this press release they put out the statement [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5180.339999999999s)]
*  But the way that the media covered it it's like the back page correction of a front page story [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5184.099999999999s)]
*  I mean this chinese spy balloon story went on for days and days and days and the correction gets no coverage [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5188.9s)]
*  now look it's also possible that [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5195.54s)]
*  That somehow the statement is not true now [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5198.740000000001s)]
*  I mean look either they were hoaxing us then or they're hoaxing us now because the statement they're saying now [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5200.820000000001s)]
*  Is incompatible with what they were saying three months ago [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5206.740000000001s)]
*  But I believe the statement now and not what they're saying three months ago because it just makes a lot more sense [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5209.14s)]
*  Um, but you know remember a few months ago [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5214.900000000001s)]
*  Uh, we had you know mids on twitter here. Let's just [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5218.34s)]

*  It's up to remember remember when mids on twitter [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5225.9400000000005s)]
*  You know when I invented that I came up with that my take was errant balloon major provocation could incite war blown up pipeline [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5229.46s)]
*  Referring to nord stream which also got blown up around in that time [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5236.34s)]
*  Not a provocation can never incite war get it straight and then the mids on twitter were you know, you think it was errant really? [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5239.3s)]
*  And he learned a new vocabulary word [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5250.900000000001s)]
*  But in his view errant was not a strong enough word to describe this [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5253.139999999999s)]
*  unprecedented national security threat by the way for those of you listening, uh, the the mid that responded to sax was jason calacanis [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5258.879999999999s)]
*  formerly of the all-in-pot [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5266.74s)]
*  Oh my god, so funny [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5268.82s)]
*  It shows how farcical our political system is because you know [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5270.9s)]
*  I here's what I think actually happened is that the story just picked up steam because it just it was it's too good [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5273.86s)]
*  Not to right so cable news starts picking it up [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5280.0199999999995s)]
*  and [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5282.740000000001s)]
*  Everyone's always trying to pump up the threat that china represents because our central global competitor now [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5283.620000000001s)]
*  And the white house I think very early on had a decision to make which is do you try and fight the story? [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5290.18s)]
*  Or do you just roll with it? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5296.900000000001s)]
*  And I think they just decided to roll with it because they would be seen as being soft on china [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5298.900000000001s)]
*  If they try to fight it and say it wasn't true [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5304.58s)]
*  And so then you had this whole farce of them shooting down all these balloons and so forth [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5307.54s)]
*  This is the whole course and trajectory right now of the united states [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5311.62s)]
*  democrats and republicans both sides of the aisle [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5316.58s)]
*  have this vested belief that we are on a collision course with china and [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5319.54s)]
*  You know whoever kind of steps it up first ends up having [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5324.820000000001s)]
*  Uh the better footing and so every opportunity that exists whether it's on chips or taiwan or human rights [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5328.1s)]
*  Or the the spy balloon [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5335.22s)]
*  Is going to be levered and amplified in some way to paint china [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5337.7s)]
*  as this conflicting force against the united states in some way [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5342.5s)]
*  And it's not going to get toned down anytime soon. Clearly. This is part of a [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5347.62s)]
*  continuous escalation cycle that may take [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5352.42s)]
*  Years may take a decade or two [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5355.3s)]
*  But ultimately, uh, there's going to be a point where this all comes to a head [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5357.94s)]
*  And it's really unfortunate to see that rather than have this, you know, deeply cooperative relationship [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5361.9400000000005s)]
*  Uh, and sorry you think you think this thing with china is going to come to a head [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5367.3s)]
*  At some point, I think we're just going to continue to escalate the tension. I'll take the other side of that, too [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5371.14s)]
*  What do you mean? Like you think it's going to be peace and and prosperity forever? [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5375.62s)]
*  No, I mean, I I think i've talked about this a little bit [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5379.3s)]
*  But I think china has just got so many internal issues. They're not going to be fighting wars. They're not gonna look [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5381.700000000001s)]
*  Like well, but my my my sorry chum off chum off. Hold on. My point is more around the orientation [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5386.58s)]
*  of the the um politicians and the orientation is we have this escalating [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5392.1s)]
*  Force in china and we need to kind of be ahead of the game [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5397.7s)]
*  I think i'm not sure who's doing that. I don't I don't well [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5400.98s)]
*  Well, I think the the point free bird is making is that the domestic [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5404.82s)]
*  politics the politics inside the united states [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5408.88s)]
*  Um leads to a [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5412.26s)]
*  A cycle of republicans democrats constantly trying to one up each other in terms of who's more hawkish towards china [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5414.42s)]
*  Right exactly that that's what I think's going on regardless of what happens on the chinese side [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5421.62s)]
*  And by the way, I mean their domestic politics probably have the same tendencies. I'm sure that [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5425.86s)]
*  Xi's got hardliners and hawks around him who don't want to back down [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5432.0199999999995s)]
*  And so I think I think in a few years from now, we won't be talking about this [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5436.58s)]
*  We talked about japan for [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5440.259999999999s)]
*  Eight nine years. We were worried. They were the boogeyman. They turned out not to be and we all moved on [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5442.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good data point. So yeah, I mean you're referring to a period [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5447.78s)]
*  I think it was like the 1980s where japan was seen as a giant [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5451.46s)]
*  Yeah, but it was never seen as a security threat to the united states [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5457.139999999999s)]
*  and [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5461.46s)]
*  China is a different kind of geopolitical competitor, right? There's a very vigorous security competition [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5462.339999999999s)]
*  They have a nuclear arsenal they have a nuclear arsenal they have more people but we have military bases in japan [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5467.94s)]
*  It was it's it's a client in the united states. It was never a security threat to the united states. That was resolved [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5473.0599999999995s)]
*  No, I think that that's fair. I just think that dollars tend to leave these things and I think that in [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5477.86s)]
*  Uh the next five to six years five to ten years. We're not going to be talking about china the same way [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5483.7s)]
*  We are today. Okay prediction made we'll come back episode eight [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5488.74s)]
*  1247 [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5493.5199999999995s)]
*  Uh, brad do our outro. I gotta fly in three hours. I'm fine [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5495.6s)]
*  Brad's gonna do brad's gonna do a really quick thing. I gotta go fun [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5499.76s)]
*  Um, have a great time brad's gonna do a quick science corner for us and then we're gonna wrap brad. Go ahead [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5502.88s)]
*  Well, you know one of the things I love about this pause we cover everything's from science to politics and and chamath last year [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5508.72s)]
*  Um, you know in his biohacking series told us all to get pre-nuvo scans, which I did which is interesting [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5516.240000000001s)]
*  And I think I don't know tamath maybe 10 people have sent you notes and said hey you helped me discover a tumor [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5522.0s)]
*  You know really amazing. Well, so this year and I did that [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5528.96s)]
*  Um, you know this year you've been talking a lot about heart flow [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5532.56s)]
*  So I said to my general practitioner at my annual checkup. Hey, I want to do this heart flow [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5534.88s)]
*  And she said oh you don't need to do a heart flow your ldls all your stuff looks really wait. Wait, wait, wait [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5539.52s)]
*  Wait, you have a female gp [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5544.08s)]
*  She's fantastic [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5547.68s)]
*  Fantastic stanford educated really terrific. I don't care where she went, but who does the prostate test? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5549.2s)]
*  He does hey listen, it's it you know some perks that come along with the psa [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5555.36s)]
*  I'm, I mean, no, but seriously you have it really I do I do that's a level of intimacy. I didn't expect for me. Wow, and so [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5561.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, but what I found interesting is when I suggested I get the heart flow. She said oh, you don't need it, etc [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5569.28s)]
*  Your ldls are low. You're you're very fit [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5575.92s)]
*  And she said but on second, you know, maybe you could go get this calcium score test [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5578.48s)]
*  right, um [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5583.5199999999995s)]
*  I didn't know anything about this [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5584.96s)]
*  But you know, I did a little quick research and it turns out a big jamma study in 2017 [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5586.24s)]
*  Over 50 percent of men and women over the age of 40 carry plaque [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5591.679999999999s)]
*  Blacks the number one killer. It's a source of heart disease and and heart attacks [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5596.96s)]
*  And as chamas been talking about there's you know a a prophylactic called statin which is basically like a supplement [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5601.759999999999s)]
*  Very little downside no long-term downside effects, but it immediately starts cutting down the amount of fatty cells and [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5608.799999999999s)]
*  And and plaque that's carried in your blood. So I thought it was interesting. I went and I had chamath [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5616.0s)]
*  As you know the core the coronary calcium scan it takes five minutes [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5621.2s)]
*  It costs between 100 and 400 dollars [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5624.96s)]
*  The fact that we don't have every person taking this over 40 is crazy and frontline doctors should all be prescribing it [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5627.2s)]
*  But particularly if there's family history, sorry, but did you also do a contrast ct with heart flow? [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5633.44s)]
*  Yeah, so I started with the calcium score 150 bucks over at stanford took five minutes and you know, it told me [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5638.16s)]
*  Uh, you know, which wasn't terribly surprising. I was one of the 50 percent [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5645.44s)]
*  That did carry some level of calcium. So it was called a non-zero score [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5649.76s)]
*  And then what they suggest is because you have a non-zero score you get this, you know, chamath [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5654.8s)]
*  You told me go do the contrast ct [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5660.4s)]
*  Which then will image what this looks like actually in your arteries [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5663.2s)]
*  So this past week in boston, I did the contrast ct again. This took 10 minutes non-invasive [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5667.44s)]
*  Like, you know, it just they run you into it. Well, no invasive because you have to put the dye [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5673.92s)]
*  So they put they yes [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5679.2s)]
*  So a tiny bit I suppose they shoot a little dye into you but you know, um, uh, didn't feel like anything [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5681.12s)]
*  I was in and out of the of the place in 40 minutes and what it found is [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5688.88s)]
*  You know fortunately that very little of this calcium had turned into what they call stenosis any narrowing of of the arteries [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5694.32s)]
*  Okay [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5702.24s)]
*  But then it gave you just a very clear picture [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5703.04s)]
*  That if you are one of the 50 percent [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5706.400000000001s)]
*  Who carry plaque over the age of 40 you should be on a prophylactic statin [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5709.280000000001s)]
*  So as chamath knows I signed up to 10 milligrams of crestar which i'm taking daily has had zero [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5713.84s)]
*  You know zero adverse consequences and in two or three months, they'll test the amount of you know, we'll revisit this calcium score [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5720.0s)]
*  Um, but when I talked to the head of cardiology what was so interesting he said [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5727.92s)]
*  Every one of his friends over the age of 40 he has them do this calcium coronary scan [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5732.4s)]
*  It's so cheap and if they're zero on their calcium reading that that's the end of the line [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5738.56s)]
*  But if they have a non-zero reading then he'll do the the ct coronary scan, which is again very cheap [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5743.6s)]
*  Um more expensive than the calcium test but very cheap and when you think about the cost [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5750.16s)]
*  Of the patients in this country [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5755.68s)]
*  Right in our health care system due to heart disease and when you think about the needless lives cut short [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5757.84s)]
*  I was shocked [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5763.92s)]
*  How easy all of this was and how empowered I feel by the data? [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5765.4400000000005s)]
*  And how fortunate I feel that i'm actually taking a supplement [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5770.16s)]
*  I call it a supplement instead of statins because I think statin has some spooky name [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD-b-Zl7yso&t=5773.360000000001s)]
