*  Yes, yes. I did the series A I believe for the day. What did [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=170.7s)]
*  you do? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=174.57999999999998s)]
*  We were in the B. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=175.22s)]
*  You were in the B. Yeah. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=176.14s)]
*  Okay. Yes. You were in the Shervin round. Okay. Well, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=176.94s)]
*  welcome to the program, Antonio. And we've got a full docket [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  today. And we might even have a special caller from the White [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=185.26s)]
*  House today. No promises, but you never know. We are 17 days [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=188.78s)]
*  into the Trump 2.0 presidency. And seems like the main character [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=193.17999999999998s)]
*  gentleman is Doge, the Department of Government [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  Efficiency. And they seem to have found a little known [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=200.42s)]
*  agency USAID. Let's unpack it and talk about USAID and Doge [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=204.98s)]
*  maybe in three acts. The first one, let me just educate the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=210.66s)]
*  audience on what USAID is and then get y'all's general reaction [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=214.82s)]
*  to it. Most Americans probably haven't heard of USAID. It [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=218.73999999999998s)]
*  stands for the United States Agency for International [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=222.66s)]
*  Development. It was established by JFK by an executive order [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=225.45999999999998s)]
*  back in 1961. Wall Street Journal summed up its purpose [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=228.62s)]
*  as quote, make friends and influence countries in the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=231.74s)]
*  American interest. According to the US Gov website, the purpose [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=234.66s)]
*  of USAID is to extend assistance to countries recovering from [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=238.5s)]
*  disaster. You got a budget of about $45 billion a year under [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=242.94s)]
*  Biden, and that's about 150 bucks per American per year. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=246.54s)]
*  They have at least 10,000 employees or did. And as of [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=251.38s)]
*  2023, they had programs in 130 countries. Obviously, there's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=255.06s)]
*  195 countries in the world. And the budget doubled under Biden [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=258.94s)]
*  from 26 to 45. The budget was between 15 and 20 billion during [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=264.98s)]
*  Trump's first term. But the White House and I guess Elon and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=269.26s)]
*  the Doge team found out about this USAID went in there and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=275.3s)]
*  found all kinds of interesting spend. $2.5 million to fund EV [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=280.62s)]
*  charging stations in Vietnam, 2 million for sex changes and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=285.5s)]
*  LGBTQ activism in Guatemala, 1.5 million to a Serbian LGBTQ [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=289.06s)]
*  group, 70k for a DEI musical 47k for a transgender opera in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=295.78000000000003s)]
*  Columbia. The DEI musical, by the way, is in Ireland. So if [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=300.5s)]
*  you get if you make it to Galway, you can see that DEI [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=304.74s)]
*  musical this one on and on and it has become quite a story. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=307.26s)]
*  Antonio, you're our guest here this week. You and I and Sax and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=313.94s)]
*  Elon spent a little time at Twitter during the takeover, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=318.82s)]
*  where I think a lot of these techniques were first put into [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=322.22s)]
*  action. Your thoughts on what's happening with Doge? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=326.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, look, Jason, at first, I want to thank you guys for [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=330.54s)]
*  having me. It's great to see everyone. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=332.26s)]
*  You can see the musical. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=335.3s)]
*  I like to see me. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=337.3s)]
*  No, I booked it. We're all going to the musical in Galway. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=337.98s)]
*  Is there actually a name of the musical? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=342.86s)]
*  Yeah, DEI, comma, the musical. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=345.46000000000004s)]
*  Oh, man. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=349.42s)]
*  It's a heartwarming story. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=350.02s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=351.78s)]
*  Of getting a job. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=352.42s)]
*  Sorry, guys. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=353.66s)]
*  That you're not qualified for. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=354.14s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=355.62s)]
*  Yes. I think the Doge story maybe starts with the Twitter [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=356.34s)]
*  takeover. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=360.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=361.21999999999997s)]
*  Right. So Twitter was spewing the woke mind virus in the [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=361.66s)]
*  world, which is why Elon did begin with. And you know, when [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=364.82s)]
*  we got there, as you know, it was basically breaking even [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=368.54s)]
*  and then there's there was going to be 12 and a half billion [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=371.02s)]
*  dollars at the end of the company. So a billion and a half [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=373.5s)]
*  dollars in interest costs that there was no money to pay, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=375.46s)]
*  which led to the turnaround, I think, which was the biggest [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=378.26s)]
*  turnaround, like of all time. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=380.18s)]
*  It's literally the biggest turn I think ever in history. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=381.86s)]
*  Second biggest tech deal ever done. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=384.14s)]
*  80% of the people gone. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=386.98s)]
*  That doesn't include all the contractors that were there. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=388.74s)]
*  And you know, the company is now servicing its debt and they [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=390.86s)]
*  just priced yesterday, their one of their bank deals at 97 [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=393.18s)]
*  cents. So this is a huge win. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=397.86s)]
*  Means the company is doing extremely well. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=400.74s)]
*  Other people bought the bank debt and then the bank traded [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=402.26s)]
*  up to a little over 98 to 98 and five eights. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=405.46s)]
*  You know, a giant business success, a rousing business [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=409.02s)]
*  success. And Jason, you were there for part of it. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=411.26s)]
*  You saw it. It was a disaster. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=413.34s)]
*  This place was, you know, it was tampons in the bathrooms and [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=415.5s)]
*  every woke thing you possibly imagine and no one in the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=418.09999999999997s)]
*  office. It was so bad that the pens had gone dry in the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=419.74s)]
*  conference rooms, which I think is incredible. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=423.46s)]
*  And I think that, you know, that's how the. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=425.82s)]
*  So you mean the pens had gone dry because they were never [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=427.53999999999996s)]
*  being used or because they were being used so much. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=429.5s)]
*  They were never been used. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=431.82s)]
*  We got there on the Halloween weekend and we started [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=432.86s)]
*  whiteboarding and, you know, the way no, no, no, no, no. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=436.62s)]
*  Next time. No, yeah, yeah. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=440.9s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, everything it was, it's incredible. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=442.74s)]
*  And but, but, uh, flowers were impeccable food being made fresh [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=444.54s)]
*  every day for thousands of people and thrown away, um, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=448.26s)]
*  three times a day, tossing the garbage, wouldn't give it to [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=451.06s)]
*  the homeless. It was just, it was shockingly bad bureaucracy [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=453.1s)]
*  gone mad, bad incentives. People don't care. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=456.54s)]
*  So it was both, I think this turned into two things. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=460.02s)]
*  One was just stop the wolf virus. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=462.46s)]
*  You know, the interesting thing is, uh, the, the, they do [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=464.26s)]
*  extra brand safety checks there now and they have 99% [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=467.14s)]
*  rating and brand safety, uh, now. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=469.41999999999996s)]
*  Right. So stock the one, buy my version going in the world. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=471.65999999999997s)]
*  Number one, number two, fix the company and both have happened. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=473.97999999999996s)]
*  It's been a couple of years now, right? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=477.06s)]
*  Three years now and both have happened. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=478.09999999999997s)]
*  Um, not even three years, two and a half years really. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=479.74s)]
*  And both have happened. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=481.53999999999996s)]
*  And I think you take that, that that was sort of the warmup act [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=482.62s)]
*  for what's going on at Doche, which is either the president [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=485.41999999999996s)]
*  of the United States, um, president Trump wants to make [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=488.06s)]
*  America great again. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=490.78000000000003s)]
*  And that I think begins with making the government great [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=491.66s)]
*  and you gotta fix it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=494.02s)]
*  It's a turnaround. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=494.9s)]
*  This is the biggest turnaround of all time. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=495.5s)]
*  And president Trump has the courage to do it. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=497.82s)]
*  And he's got a great ally in Ilan to make it happen in Doche. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=500.42s)]
*  And so the numbers are pretty easy, right? [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=502.98s)]
*  Uh, we're spending, uh, six and a half trillion. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=505.38s)]
*  We bring in four and a half trillion. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=508.38s)]
*  We've got to find $2 trillion somewhere. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=509.9s)]
*  Interest costs $2 trillion a year. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=511.46s)]
*  The bond markets were going up. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=513.38s)]
*  The bond was going up a lot because people didn't believe [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=514.58s)]
*  that you couldn't stop spending, creating inflation. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=516.86s)]
*  You see those trading down now as Doge is starting to take effect. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=518.94s)]
*  We'll see it's real. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=521.74s)]
*  The stuff you're talking about, it's sort of extraordinary. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=522.34s)]
*  What's happening in the, you know, Ilan said it's probably [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=525.34s)]
*  the right fraud, waste and abuse. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=527.82s)]
*  He needs kind of 10% of the budget is probably fraud. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=529.38s)]
*  I think it might be low actually. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=532.34s)]
*  So you're talking about, you know, six, 650 billion, a trillion waste. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=534.82s)]
*  I think that's probably about right. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=538.74s)]
*  That alone fixes the problem, but it's really serious about it, Jason, for me. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=540.0600000000001s)]
*  And what scared me when I, when we first started thinking about this, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=543.1800000000001s)]
*  and I'm not there full time, you know, I'm in and out a little bit and [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=546.14s)]
*  trying to help where I can, but I'm not there full time. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=549.9399999999999s)]
*  When I thought that when this started, I thought we had a democracy [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=551.9s)]
*  that had turned into a bureaucracy. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=555.34s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=556.78s)]
*  What I'm afraid of now is we have a bureaucracy that is about to [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=558.6999999999999s)]
*  turn into a kleptocracy. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=563.14s)]
*  I mean, a Latin American style kleptocracy. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=565.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=566.98s)]
*  The stuff you're talking about, that is pure fraud. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=567.14s)]
*  And you're making, you're making some jokes out of it, the DIA musical. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=570.3s)]
*  But if you go into the data that's coming out of USAID, which you find is [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=573.06s)]
*  you know, there's a lot of political contributions going on there. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=576.8199999999999s)]
*  Politico itself being funded by USAID. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=578.42s)]
*  I mean, that is pure corruption. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=581.62s)]
*  That's like a Latin American style autocracy and we cannot let it go there. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=583.02s)]
*  I mean, I think we've, I think this happened just in a good time. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=587.38s)]
*  And I'm super grateful to all the people there. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=589.78s)]
*  There's, you know, 80 plus people there, all patriots gone full time. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=591.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=594.9s)]
*  So Chamath, you've been watching this here from Antonio, what's your general [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=595.22s)]
*  take on what we saw in the first, I don't know, 20 days of Doge? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=599.5s)]
*  Or no, 15 days, sorry. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=604.1s)]
*  It's 15 days of Doge. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=605.3000000000001s)]
*  So let me try to give you a little bit of historical context, because I [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=607.22s)]
*  think that that's important. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=611.1800000000001s)]
*  I think whenever I hear so many people breathlessly saying some version of WTF, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=613.02s)]
*  as if this is totally new, it's not new. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=620.46s)]
*  And I'll give you two examples, but one that I really want to double click on. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=624.5400000000001s)]
*  The two examples I'll give you is that in 1941, the first one was [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=629.02s)]
*  the Truman committee was formed because there was a fear that the spending by [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=633.5s)]
*  the defense department was completely out of whack. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=640.82s)]
*  And over the next six or seven years, and this is really what gave [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=645.82s)]
*  Truman the credibility to then become Roosevelt's vice president was they [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=650.18s)]
*  found incredible levels of waste, fraud, and abuse during the war. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=654.94s)]
*  Before the war effort and then after Pearl Harbor during the war process. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=660.42s)]
*  Over seven years, that committee, and this is in 1941 dollars, they were [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=665.5s)]
*  tasked and budgeted with only 20 or $30,000. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=671.82s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=676.22s)]
*  Over the next six years, they spent less than a million. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=676.9399999999999s)]
*  Inflation adjusted to 2023. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=679.62s)]
*  This is where I found the data was about six and a half million they spent. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=682.58s)]
*  You know how much they saved? [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=686.3s)]
*  It's estimated they saved somewhere between 10 to $15 billion in 1941. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=687.42s)]
*  That's a quarter of a trillion, 20, $23. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=693.98s)]
*  The second example is we did this under president Clinton, and that was called [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=698.3s)]
*  the national partnership for reinventing government. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=703.34s)]
*  So the first thing that I think it's important to acknowledge is this is not [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=706.9399999999999s)]
*  new we've done doge twice before, but we've done it twice before, and we've [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=711.3s)]
*  done doge twice before both had been successful. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=716.0200000000001s)]
*  The Harry Truman one was incredibly important because it really set guard [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=720.1800000000001s)]
*  rails for how this can be done. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=725.0200000000001s)]
*  Everything in that committee was a Senate committee was unanimous. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=726.4200000000001s)]
*  So it was Republicans and Democrats that found waste, fraud, and abuse everywhere. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=729.94s)]
*  They saved an enormous amount of money. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=735.2600000000001s)]
*  The second, which is interesting is these last two versions of doge were [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=738.3000000000001s)]
*  driven and led by Democrats. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=742.5400000000001s)]
*  The same people today who are basically saying, Hey, hold on a second. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=744.26s)]
*  We have congressional committees or we have inspector generals. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=748.4200000000001s)]
*  And they lack the awareness to know that their own party was the driving [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=753.1800000000001s)]
*  force for this two times before. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=757.5400000000001s)]
*  And I think it's important to just acknowledge that those methods are not [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=760.4200000000001s)]
*  good anymore, right? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=764.82s)]
*  Because I think what we're finding early days is the rot is super pervasive. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=766.34s)]
*  There's no accountability. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=771.02s)]
*  And so I think you need people to look at it with fresh eyes. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=773.14s)]
*  And what is doge at the end of the day? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=775.66s)]
*  What they are, are read only auditors of the truth. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=777.5s)]
*  And the press secretary in the white house made this very clear. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=781.6999999999999s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=785.66s)]
*  The power that read only access gives you all that allows you to do is just [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=786.5s)]
*  take the data and present the data. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=791.18s)]
*  They can't manipulate it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=793.8199999999999s)]
*  And what they're able to do is publish all of this stuff in real time. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=795.3s)]
*  And that's why this is so important because if it went into a congressional [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=798.2199999999999s)]
*  committee, to be honest with you, it would sit there and stew for six, seven, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=801.42s)]
*  eight, nine months, you would maybe get small little tidbits of it, but now [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=808.02s)]
*  instead you're just getting the full thrust of it. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=812.14s)]
*  And what is the biggest thing that I find concerning? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=814.18s)]
*  I think it's what Antonio said, which is that the media who are supposed to be [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=819.66s)]
*  this intermediary layer that's totally objective between the government and [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=825.9s)]
*  the people were not independent at all, but had all kinds of hidden incentives. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=831.34s)]
*  $8 million to Politico, several million dollars to the BBC. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=837.5s)]
*  I think it's important to ask what's going on. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=841.7800000000001s)]
*  And by the way, that also has historical context. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=843.86s)]
*  This is exactly what happened in the sixties and seventies where it turned [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=847.98s)]
*  out that record companies were paying DJs to pay songs. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=851.6600000000001s)]
*  There was a huge set of lawsuits and trial cases. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=856.7s)]
*  And the result was a change in the law. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=860.3399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=862.78s)]
*  And we call that payola now, which is you cannot take this [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=862.9799999999999s)]
*  money without disclosing it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=865.5799999999999s)]
*  And so had this money been absorbed by these entities and actually disclose, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=867.66s)]
*  maybe we'd be okay, but Nick, I sent you a link. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=872.38s)]
*  Maybe you can throw it on the screen for these guys. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=874.4599999999999s)]
*  It's a very simple manifestation of this cycle. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=876.7399999999999s)]
*  We talked about this guys and we didn't realize how connected it all was, but we [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=880.02s)]
*  were asking ourselves during the election cycle last year, why are all these [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=886.42s)]
*  articles buried? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=889.58s)]
*  Why aren't we really getting the truth? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=890.5400000000001s)]
*  And it turns out that the people who were responsible for telling the truth [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=892.7s)]
*  somewhere along the chain were cajoled or just told not to tell the truth, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=897.1s)]
*  influenced by all of this back channel money that was going back and forth [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=901.34s)]
*  from the government to these folks. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=905.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=906.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=907.34s)]
*  Let me just give some numbers to what you were referencing there. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=907.58s)]
*  The U S aid organization has been giving money, uh, as have other agencies, two [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=912.7800000000001s)]
*  journals, databases, and subscriptions. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=919.86s)]
*  There's probably some amount of that that makes sense. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=922.2600000000001s)]
*  However, when we look at this during Trump, one spend on political was averaging [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=924.5400000000001s)]
*  around 1.3 million a year, but it suddenly ballooned up to 8 million a year under [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=929.5400000000001s)]
*  Biden, and you can see the quarterly payments here on this chart. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=933.6600000000001s)]
*  So there's some normal amount of spend on publications or for a library at an [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=937.54s)]
*  organization. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=942.9799999999999s)]
*  And so what we're looking here is all federal agencies. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=944.02s)]
*  And suddenly during Biden, there is a very suspicious ramp up in spend to [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=947.06s)]
*  Politico. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=952.26s)]
*  All of this is breaking. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=953.06s)]
*  A lot of this hasn't been verified yet, so we'll, we'll put that caveat on it. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=954.14s)]
*  And then there is a number of 34 million that's been floating around. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=959.74s)]
*  That's all years back to 2008, not just 2024, less people have that number [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=963.4200000000001s)]
*  juxtaposed or, or, or, um, misattributed. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=970.62s)]
*  When political was acquired back in 2021, they were doing about 200 million in [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=974.6600000000001s)]
*  revenue. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=978.02s)]
*  So this would be about 4% of their revenue. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=978.6600000000001s)]
*  It's pretty significant. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=981.5s)]
*  The BBC also received 2.7 million in funding from USAID in 2023. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=982.46s)]
*  That was 8% of their annual income. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=987.74s)]
*  That's a little suspicious. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=989.74s)]
*  Thompson Reuters, which is the consulting arm of Reuters. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=990.86s)]
*  They've received $120 million from the federal government since 2011. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=995.0600000000001s)]
*  That's got to be looked at and double clicked on. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=999.38s)]
*  And half of that came during the Biden administration. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1001.74s)]
*  New York times. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1004.66s)]
*  Hasn't actually received all that much. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1006.62s)]
*  370 K from the federal government last year under Biden, it went from a [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1008.3000000000001s)]
*  hundred K a year to like 300. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1011.62s)]
*  So the New York times data has been cleaned up a little bit. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1013.3000000000001s)]
*  All of this is to say there's spending going on with the press that certainly [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1017.62s)]
*  doesn't look good and should be verified and challenged obviously. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1022.62s)]
*  And we are in a breaking news environment. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1027.94s)]
*  So we'll see how that information shakes out over time, which is one of the great [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1029.46s)]
*  things I think about Doge is they're getting this information out there and [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1035.34s)]
*  citizen journalists are looking at public databases, Friedberg, and we're [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1038.54s)]
*  having a conversation about this. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1043.94s)]
*  A conversation two years ago, Friedberg, when you kept harping on every episode [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1045.46s)]
*  about our debt and, uh, you know, about the interest payments two or three years [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1049.8200000000002s)]
*  ago, you were way ahead of the curve. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1053.8200000000002s)]
*  And now here we are. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1056.3000000000002s)]
*  We didn't think anybody would ever take this cause up. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1057.7s)]
*  And now it is the cause of the moment. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1060.46s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the first two weeks of Doge Friedberg? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1062.8600000000001s)]
*  Magnificent. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1066.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1067.94s)]
*  Magnificent. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1068.22s)]
*  I mean, what else is there to say? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1069.94s)]
*  Yeah, this is the eggplant emoji. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1072.66s)]
*  It's what we needed. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1074.18s)]
*  If you zoom out on what Doge is doing, I think the best way to describe it [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1075.1000000000001s)]
*  is zero-based budgeting. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1078.3400000000001s)]
*  And in organizations that go through zero-based budgeting, you do a cycle [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1079.8200000000002s)]
*  typically annually where you take all of your op-ex, all of your expenses and [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1083.3000000000002s)]
*  running a company or running an organization down to the studs, you take [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1087.0600000000002s)]
*  it down to zero and you rebuild it up and you say, what are we trying to [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1090.0600000000002s)]
*  achieve this year from first principles based on that set of objectives, those [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1092.98s)]
*  goals, what do we need to do? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1096.7800000000002s)]
*  What's the minimal expense we need to run? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1097.8600000000001s)]
*  You don't start with last year's numbers and say, what else do we need to do? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1100.3000000000002s)]
*  And start to add on top of that. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1103.62s)]
*  You really do a hard level, high degree of scrutiny on every dollar moving out. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1104.74s)]
*  And that's what Doge is effectively doing. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1109.22s)]
*  They're doing a zero-based budgeting on the federal government. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1110.82s)]
*  They're looking at every line item and they're asking the fundamental question, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1114.06s)]
*  which I don't think we talk about in the public discourse enough, which is what [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1116.8999999999999s)]
*  is the essential role of government? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1120.9399999999998s)]
*  And there is a great debate to be had around that point. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1123.62s)]
*  Should government be providing humanitarian aid in international markets? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1126.78s)]
*  That's a good debate to be had. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1131.1399999999999s)]
*  Should the government be providing security to nations that can't provide [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1133.06s)]
*  security for themselves? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1136.5s)]
*  Does the U S government have a role in that? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1137.94s)]
*  Should the government be providing loans for people to go to universities? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1139.54s)]
*  Should the government be providing loans for people to buy homes that are [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1143.22s)]
*  overpriced, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1146.1000000000001s)]
*  And as we start to ask the questions of how we're spending money, I think it [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1149.18s)]
*  ends up leading to the most important questions, which is what is the essential [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1152.38s)]
*  role of government, which I think is the debate that needs to be had in order [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1156.1000000000001s)]
*  for the democracy to last. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1159.7s)]
*  So I'm very happy to see the effort of Doge. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1161.26s)]
*  And I think that it's the beginning of what I hope will be kind of a longterm [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1163.46s)]
*  process of asking the fundamental questions about essential government. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1166.18s)]
*  And Antonio, zero-based budgeting was the first thing you sort of introduced [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1170.5800000000002s)]
*  when the Twitter takeover happened. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1175.38s)]
*  Just what do we need in terms of design? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1177.7s)]
*  What does the sales team need to hit these sales numbers? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1179.54s)]
*  How many servers do we need? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1182.06s)]
*  And my Lord, the waste fraud and abuse at that company was shocking. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1184.3400000000001s)]
*  They had buildings that were a hundred dollars a square foot, if I remember [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1190.22s)]
*  correctly, that were used for storage of the furniture from the previous building [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1193.98s)]
*  that had been upgraded and were storing them in class A office space. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1199.34s)]
*  You reference the commissary. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1204.74s)]
*  Twenty people were having lunch a day, but they had never ratcheted down the [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1207.74s)]
*  amount of food they were making. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1212.3s)]
*  So each meal was about $800 on average when you, when you did the math for those [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1213.42s)]
*  20 meals, just in the San Francisco office, maybe you could talk a little bit about [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1218.42s)]
*  how the shock and awe campaign of just freezing spending and then seeing, hey, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1223.66s)]
*  what actually is necessary to accomplish this task worked out at Twitter and then [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1231.7s)]
*  how you see that being executed inside of our government. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1237.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Jason. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1242.8600000000001s)]
*  It was pretty extraordinary, actually. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1243.5s)]
*  The Twitter experience, the first thing you do in a journal like that is try and [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1244.9s)]
*  get the checkbook and just turn payments off and then see what happens because [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1248.7800000000002s)]
*  there are lots of people that shouldn't be getting paid and sometimes they [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1252.6200000000001s)]
*  complain and sometimes you find that people that complain the loudest are the [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1255.46s)]
*  ones who are committing the worst fraud. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1257.94s)]
*  They're the worst fraudsters in the whole game, right? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1259.94s)]
*  The worst grifters are the ones who are saying they're crying the most amount of [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1261.7800000000002s)]
*  foul and the problem, at least in Twitter, there were financial statements. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1265.6200000000001s)]
*  Like we could actually, there was an audit financial statement and they were [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1271.02s)]
*  basically, they weren't in some ways correct. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1273.02s)]
*  I would say there were some issues with the user growth and dollars, et cetera, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1275.46s)]
*  and the incentive plans, but the actual, the cash flow numbers were pretty much [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1279.26s)]
*  correct. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1282.42s)]
*  Here, the problem is much, much deeper and it makes this zero debt based [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1283.34s)]
*  budgeting question much harder, which is the way the government works, a [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1287.9s)]
*  department just basically asks for money from treasury and they send it out. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1292.62s)]
*  We all run businesses. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1296.58s)]
*  There's a reconciliation process. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1297.86s)]
*  You have a contract, you issue a PO against it. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1299.46s)]
*  Something comes in, you check that it came in, services is rendered, and then [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1302.6200000000001s)]
*  you issue a payable and then a month later you pay it, right? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1306.58s)]
*  That doesn't happen with US government. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1310.3s)]
*  That process is broken. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1311.78s)]
*  It used to happen. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1313.6200000000001s)]
*  It's broken now. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1314.66s)]
*  And so literally money's flowing out. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1315.7s)]
*  I used to ask myself this question, why are the numbers always revised? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1317.78s)]
*  Why are they always wrong? [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1320.98s)]
*  How can the government know how much money it's made? [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1321.74s)]
*  Just hit the button in the computer and figure it out. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1322.98s)]
*  Problem is that button doesn't exist. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1324.98s)]
*  We spent time early on. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1327.26s)]
*  I was at Mar-a-Lago with Elon trying to track through like, how does the money [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1328.42s)]
*  actually flow? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1331.6200000000001s)]
*  No one could tell us how it actually flows. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1333.14s)]
*  Where is it going out? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1334.3000000000002s)]
*  People didn't know. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1335.98s)]
*  And it's totally crazy. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1337.02s)]
*  And it's the reason. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1338.18s)]
*  You all go through treasury, Antonio, or like, can you just explain that to us? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1339.26s)]
*  Well, so I will try to explain it to you. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1343.0600000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1344.78s)]
*  I have full command of it. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1345.18s)]
*  I'm not sure anyone does quite yet. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1346.14s)]
*  It goes to treasury ultimately, but it was supposed to flow through the way it [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1348.26s)]
*  was supposed to work in the, it was changed in the seventies, in the seventies in 1973. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1352.0600000000002s)]
*  The Nixon administration at, in 71, let me go back, they came off the gold standard, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1357.3400000000001s)]
*  which allowed deficits. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1360.7800000000002s)]
*  In 73, at the nader of the Nixon presidency, Congress took away from the presidency, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1361.5s)]
*  the executive power, this thing called the portionments, which was the power of the [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1366.74s)]
*  executive to stop spending. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1369.66s)]
*  So Nixon was abusing it by stopping what he didn't want. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1371.22s)]
*  And so Congress took away from him. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1373.74s)]
*  What that means today is the executive, as he reaches in, it's very hard to just [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1374.7s)]
*  stop payments. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1379.5s)]
*  So what's happening is the, the government is, is put in a process where they would [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1380.98s)]
*  just have an authorized executive kind of stamp a bill that got paid that broke. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1386.26s)]
*  I don't know when it broke, but it broke sometime. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1392.3s)]
*  So the money flow now department gets a budget authorized to it by Congress. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1394.18s)]
*  It goes to OMB, OMB allocates the budget. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1400.58s)]
*  That department then just sends a money request to treasury to pay. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1403.14s)]
*  It is not reconciled against what happened. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1408.18s)]
*  This is one of the reasons. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1410.14s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1412.1s)]
*  There's no, there's no, there's no controller. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1412.7s)]
*  There's no controller function. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1414.8999999999999s)]
*  Like there isn't a normal company. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1416.1s)]
*  100%. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1417.34s)]
*  There is no control. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1418.1399999999999s)]
*  There is no controller. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1418.8999999999999s)]
*  There's no reconciliation. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1420.22s)]
*  The reason they can't pass audits. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1421.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1423.3799999999999s)]
*  There, the reason this happens is because you can't audit something you haven't [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1423.62s)]
*  reconciled. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1427.34s)]
*  You're the only audit that I've seen is actually from the social security [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1428.86s)]
*  administration. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1431.54s)]
*  And when you read it, I've got one, I part is you've read the thing. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1432.4199999999998s)]
*  Uh, it has, it's just riddled material weaknesses that are probably all [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1435.06s)]
*  individuals that have made like millions or billions of dollars from miss payments [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1439.1s)]
*  overseas. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1443.9s)]
*  Like, is this kind of what's gone on in the missing money in Ukraine? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1444.5800000000002s)]
*  Do you think like it's kind of found its way to the wrong places? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1448.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1450.8600000000001s)]
*  I mean, so what I would, I don't know what happened in Ukraine. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1451.1000000000001s)]
*  I don't. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1453.5800000000002s)]
*  It's a crazy story. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1453.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1454.8200000000002s)]
*  It is shocking about Ukraine. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1455.26s)]
*  I will say that I have expensed experience trying to work in businesses that had [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1456.3000000000002s)]
*  Medicaid and Medicaid Medicare's payments. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1460.74s)]
*  I wanted to make that better. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1462.5800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1463.74s)]
*  We, we use this to make the world better and we just stopped because we [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1463.98s)]
*  sounds, we found so much fraud. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1467.5s)]
*  I mean, I'm, I'm certain we literally have a rule here. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1469.46s)]
*  Uh, government pay or in those areas, if it's more than like a third of the [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1472.7s)]
*  business, we don't do it. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1475.94s)]
*  And in the services space, this is, this is why we just sound, we found [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1477.0200000000002s)]
*  continuous fraud in the companies we were looking at investing in. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1480.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1484.14s)]
*  Just threading these things together. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1484.2600000000002s)]
*  You know, you, the really interesting thing with the Twitter pausing of [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1485.94s)]
*  payments was, you know, at some point we were in a meeting, you know, at one [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1491.22s)]
*  AM on a Saturday and it was like, Hey, let's turn the credit cards off to see [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1494.66s)]
*  what bounces and, uh, you know, and what happens. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1499.18s)]
*  And then of course we start getting calls and people started routing, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1502.62s)]
*  obviously because they knew Saks was there. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1506.58s)]
*  You were there. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1508.62s)]
*  I was there. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1509.02s)]
*  Hey, you know, a company who I shared an investor with, or, you know, in [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1510.06s)]
*  another company said, Hey, you know, we're not getting paid for this. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1514.94s)]
*  And it was like some SaaS software that nobody was using, et cetera. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1517.7s)]
*  So you start figuring out to your point. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1521.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1523.42s)]
*  Is this software even being used? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1523.8999999999999s)]
*  There was so much software and services that had been paid that nobody had [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1526.06s)]
*  ever logged into set up. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1530.78s)]
*  So it was just paid as pure graph. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1532.98s)]
*  Now you said, Antonio, correctly, the people who come first, like they're [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1534.98s)]
*  probably the ones who are in on the biggest grift because, Hey, you know, I [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1539.54s)]
*  figured out how to grift this money. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1543.06s)]
*  How us aid got to the top of the Doge list, I think is one of the most [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1544.62s)]
*  interesting aspects of this story. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1549.3799999999999s)]
*  So if you remember on January 21st, Trump decided he would do a bunch of [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1551.6200000000001s)]
*  executive orders, right? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1556.5s)]
*  And one of them was to pause foreign aid for 90 days. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1557.9s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1561.26s)]
*  This seems reasonable. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1561.78s)]
*  We got to take care of our country. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1563.18s)]
*  That was part of his mandate for becoming the 47th president of the United States. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1564.46s)]
*  So a couple of days later, the white house said, Hey, this USAID leadership is [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1568.78s)]
*  trying to circumvent the executive order there. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1574.18s)]
*  In other words, they're just going to keep paying people, even though the [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1576.58s)]
*  executive order came out. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1579.42s)]
*  That alerted the Doge team. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1581.58s)]
*  So Elon confirmed this on X. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1583.42s)]
*  He said, quote, all Doge did was check to see which federal organizations were [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1585.5s)]
*  violating the president's executive orders. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1589.66s)]
*  The most turned out to be USAID. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1592.42s)]
*  So that became our focus. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1595.06s)]
*  And according to NBC security officials at USAID tried to prevent Doge from even [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1597.18s)]
*  getting into the building or accessing the systems to your point, Antonio, the [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1602.1000000000001s)]
*  person probably who's got the most to hide is the one who's going to fight the [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1606.74s)]
*  most over the weekend. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1610.9s)]
*  Doge gained access to USAID. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1612.14s)]
*  And then people started tweeting out all of this, you know, crazy spend and things [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1614.7s)]
*  that any American who looks at it and says, wait a second, if we haven't fixed [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1620.8200000000002s)]
*  the goddamn water in Flint, Michigan, why are we sending money to Galway or in [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1625.38s)]
*  Ireland to do a DEI musical? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1629.74s)]
*  This makes no sense. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1631.5800000000002s)]
*  And that's, I think the key piece of this, Antonio is can you win the hearts [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1633.1000000000001s)]
*  and minds of Americans? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1637.1s)]
*  Because some of this stuff, I don't know if it's legal or it's not legal or it's [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1639.82s)]
*  against protocol or it is protocol. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1644.74s)]
*  We're going to find out there's been tons of legal cases and lawsuits that have [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1646.7s)]
*  been filed. But to your point, this is how Elon found out about USAID. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1651.58s)]
*  J. Cal, let me ask you a question. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1657.26s)]
*  Where does that place you in your political philosophy around the importance [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1658.5s)]
*  of human rights abroad? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1663.9s)]
*  Great question. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1664.94s)]
*  You know, I've always felt that the West should act in unison. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1667.3s)]
*  And if the United States is the greatest economy or the strongest, we should lead. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1671.3s)]
*  There is something called the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1675.5s)]
*  The United States, Eleanor Roosevelt wrote this at the UN and everybody tries to [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1678.3400000000001s)]
*  hit those notes. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1682.66s)]
*  I think it's great that we try to reduce suffering in the world, but I think we [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1684.06s)]
*  should be doing it not unilaterally and not to try to manipulate governments. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1687.8200000000002s)]
*  And that's the piece of this that USAID is obviously a grift where people are [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1692.42s)]
*  trying to steal money for their pet projects. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1696.94s)]
*  And I don't think they're acting in unison and above board to look and say, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1699.66s)]
*  okay, where's the most suffering in the world? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1704.26s)]
*  How can we help that? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1706.7s)]
*  You know, that, that to me seems like a noble thing to do. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1707.78s)]
*  And if the United States has the budget to help fight AIDS in Africa or, you [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1710.46s)]
*  know, poverty, you know, that's fine. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1714.9s)]
*  There's a chance that some of these human rights issues are going to be [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1716.5s)]
*  Well, I do think the, you know, I did this tweet recently. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1719.22s)]
*  So yes is the answer. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1722.1000000000001s)]
*  If you look at Amnesty International, Amnesty International, where I worked was [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1723.8600000000001s)]
*  one of my first jobs. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1727.3s)]
*  They were worked working on people who were imprisoned, tortured, raped, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1728.66s)]
*  murdered, systematic murder of dissidents for freedom of speech, freedom of [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1732.8200000000002s)]
*  assembly, religion, et cetera. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1738.14s)]
*  And then somewhere along the line, you know, the actual, the actual [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1740.02s)]
*  And that's the big focus. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1744.18s)]
*  This is a very small amount of, you know, people on the planet. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1745.02s)]
*  And I don't think that those human rights violations in any way relate to [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1748.9s)]
*  the tragedy we're seeing of people being murdered, tortured, raped, and [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1753.26s)]
*  caned and beheaded in certain places in the world. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1757.1s)]
*  So there is a way to look at suffering and say, okay, I'm going to be [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1760.06s)]
*  a victim of this, but I'm going to be a victim of this, but I'm going to be [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1764.58s)]
*  a victim of this, but I'm going to be a victim of this, but I'm going to be [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1768.58s)]
*  And so this thing has gotten the other fascinating thing I think about USA [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1772.3799999999999s)]
*  and I'd like to get your thoughts on to Chamath is at what point did this [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1777.34s)]
*  switch from being the left say that, you know, we should be the left? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1782.54s)]
*  And I think that's the thing that's really fascinating about USA and [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1787.4199999999998s)]
*  which I like to get your thoughts on too, Chamath is at what point did this [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1791.3s)]
*  switch from being the left say that, you know, we should be the left? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1795.98s)]
*  The left saying we should not intervene, right? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1800.5800000000002s)]
*  The left's position always in the 80s, 90s when we were growing up was we [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1804.46s)]
*  shouldn't be doing these operatives in other countries. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1808.02s)]
*  We should let democracy flow. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1810.66s)]
*  Let these countries figure it out for themselves. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1812.14s)]
*  We shouldn't be doing empire building. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1814.1000000000001s)]
*  We shouldn't be doing imperialism. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1815.74s)]
*  And then all of a sudden now it's just such a griff that I think everybody's [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1818.0600000000002s)]
*  got their hands in the pie. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1821.38s)]
*  Lindsey Graham's on some nonprofit that gets money from this. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1822.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't know if that's above board or not. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1825.78s)]
*  Everybody, a lot of people who are formerly in government seem to be [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1828.18s)]
*  part of this NGO train. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1832.1s)]
*  So the whole thing's just turned out to be a grift and it's a [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1833.8999999999999s)]
*  bipartisan grift, obviously. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1836.26s)]
*  I think the biggest thing that we will have to confront is that many of the [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1840.18s)]
*  things that we thought were issues or problems may have actually been somewhat [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1845.82s)]
*  embellished because of this money cycle. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1854.1399999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1858.5s)]
*  And I think that that's going to cause a lot of people to feel really, they'll [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1859.1399999999999s)]
*  probably feel really foolish about some of the decisions they made, all the [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1864.4199999999998s)]
*  attempts at cancellation are going to look really dumb in hindsight. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1868.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1871.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1873.06s)]
*  I might just say a shout out to our friend David Sacks here who's coming online. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1873.6599999999999s)]
*  Oh, okay, here he is. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1875.86s)]
*  David, looking good. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1876.3799999999999s)]
*  And the one thing I want to point out, this goes way back, I think maybe [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1877.86s)]
*  more than a decade ago, David tried to explain to me that neocons had taken [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1882.78s)]
*  over American foreign policy and they were, well, your question about why did [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1887.66s)]
*  the Democrats change, why do Republicans change, et cetera, the neocons took over [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1891.78s)]
*  foreign policy on both sides, Democrats and Republicans, and populated out this [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1895.3799999999999s)]
*  very activist muster stance, which is bad for America. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1899.22s)]
*  And I think Jason, that answered your question as to why the Democrats shifted. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1901.8999999999999s)]
*  All right. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1905.06s)]
*  With us is David Sacks. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1905.22s)]
*  How are you doing, brother? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1907.22s)]
*  Are you literally in the White House? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1908.06s)]
*  I'm in the EOB. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1910.6599999999999s)]
*  Ah, okay. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1913.7s)]
*  There's like a podcast studio actually in the EOB. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1914.82s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1917.5s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1917.74s)]
*  And you're wearing a suit every day. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1918.46s)]
*  I know you're right. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1920.1399999999999s)]
*  I have to wear a suit and tie every day. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1920.6599999999999s)]
*  I was just listening on your conversation about Doge. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1922.34s)]
*  Jacob, I'm surprised that you never figured out a way to get involved in this USA. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1925.98s)]
*  I mean, everybody's on the take except you. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1930.3799999999999s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1932.5s)]
*  If I had known, I would have started an NGO. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1933.02s)]
*  Where's my NGO? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1935.78s)]
*  You had everything except the money laundering. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1937.18s)]
*  You had the grip. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1938.94s)]
*  You had the virtue signaling. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1939.9s)]
*  Ha. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1941.38s)]
*  You had it all except the actual money. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1941.78s)]
*  Let me up level this for a second. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1943.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1945.38s)]
*  So we knew the US government runs a $2 trillion deficit every year. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1945.7s)]
*  We're in debt, almost $40 trillion. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1951.3s)]
*  And we also knew that anytime anyone tries to cut anything in Washington, the [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1953.9s)]
*  whole city screams bloody murder. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1957.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1959.3400000000001s)]
*  So the question is just why. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1959.66s)]
*  Well, now we know the money is all going to them. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1961.38s)]
*  It's like round tripping to them. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1963.8200000000002s)]

*  Like 11 out of 12 publications, Ukraine getting paid. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1975.86s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1978.54s)]
*  Viktor Orban, who's the prime minister of Hungary, was saying that he's very popular [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1979.1399999999999s)]
*  in Hungary, his political opposition funded by USAID. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1983.3s)]
*  In Poland, the left-wing political opposition funded by USAID and on and on and on it goes. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1987.86s)]
*  BBC. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1993.9399999999998s)]
*  BBC. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1994.6599999999999s)]
*  You wonder why everyone in the UK. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1995.1399999999999s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1996.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1997.3s)]
*  Like every left wing organization in the world seems to be getting paid by this [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=1997.6999999999998s)]
*  slush fund at USAID, which disperses about 50 billion a year. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2005.58s)]
*  That's a billion dollars a week. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2009.3s)]
*  That's actually a lot of money. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2010.82s)]
*  And so it just, it makes you wonder, you know, the left in general tries to portray [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2012.9399999999998s)]
*  itself as a movement of the people, that it's grassroots. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2017.3s)]
*  This is the exact opposite. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2021.26s)]
*  This is AstroTurf. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2022.34s)]
*  This is basically money coming from the top down out of Washington to fund all of these [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2023.34s)]
*  groups, maybe not even in the United States, like all over the world. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2028.06s)]
*  So it makes you wonder, what is the real level of local support for these left-wing [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2030.78s)]
*  policies all over the world? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2037.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2038.86s)]
*  Crazy. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2039.3799999999999s)]
*  So you did a big announcement this week on crypto and creating a framework. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2040.22s)]
*  Finally, I caught some of it. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2045.1s)]
*  Maybe you could just tell us, you know, from the bottom up, what is the mandate from [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2047.82s)]
*  the president and what is your advice to him on how to make crypto move out of the [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2052.3s)]
*  shadows offshore, ICOs craziness to legitimacy? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2058.34s)]
*  What's the plan here to legitimize and regulate crypto? [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2063.38s)]
*  Well, the plan was really spelled out by President Trump in his week one EO on [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2067.54s)]
*  crypto, and it's all spelled out in there. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2071.7400000000002s)]
*  The principles, the administration on crypto, the president said he wants to support the [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2073.54s)]
*  responsible use and growth of digital assets and blockchains across every sector of the [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2077.1s)]
*  economy. So the principles are all there. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2083.74s)]
*  And yesterday I was invited up to Capitol Hill to meet with the chairman of the important [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2086.3399999999997s)]
*  committees that will be that basically govern crypto. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2092.94s)]
*  And so we had a press conference there to announce the legislative plan. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2096.7s)]
*  You can see there there's Chairman Tim Scott, who's the chair of the Senate Banking [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2100.74s)]
*  Committee to my left and then to my right is French Hill, who's the chairman of the [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2105.58s)]
*  House Financial Services Committee. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2110.14s)]
*  And then to his right is John Bozeman, who's the chair of the Senate Agriculture [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2112.06s)]
*  Committee. And then to the left of Tim Scott is G.T. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2118.02s)]
*  Thompson, who's the chair of the House Agriculture Committee. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2123.14s)]
*  He's out of frame right now. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2126.7s)]
*  But those are the four committees that govern crypto. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2128.22s)]
*  And you may ask, why is the Agriculture Committee involved in crypto? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2130.42s)]
*  And the reason is because the ad committee supervises the CFTC, the Commodities Futures [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2133.26s)]
*  Trading Commission, because commodities all came out of agriculture. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2139.38s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2143.46s)]
*  You need four committees across the House and Senate to get legislation done on crypto. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2145.0200000000004s)]
*  It's not just House and Senate. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2150.94s)]
*  It's actually two committees in each of the House and Senate. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2152.34s)]
*  And so this is the first time where we've had four chairman of the four key committees all [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2155.0600000000004s)]
*  come together and say that they're ready to support crypto legislation. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2160.5s)]
*  There are a lot of people on X who felt like this wasn't, you know, a mind blowing [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2164.58s)]
*  announcement. They wanted something that they could trade on right away. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2168.58s)]
*  That's not what this was. This was basically a statement of commitment from the chairs, the [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2171.54s)]
*  four committees that were to get legislation done this year, maybe in the next six months. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2176.86s)]
*  I mean, that's really the goal. And we've never had that before. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2181.26s)]
*  So that is pretty monumental. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2183.78s)]
*  I used to work in this because when I first launched Climate Court back in the day, we [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2185.58s)]
*  actually were selling commodity contracts online. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2190.18s)]
*  So we set ourselves up as an exempt commodity trading platform. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2192.58s)]
*  And so I remember all this old legislation. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2198.54s)]
*  There was the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, if I remember, when they deregulated the [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2201.3799999999997s)]
*  energy markets. But one of the features of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act was that [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2206.58s)]
*  they created this concept of an exempt commodity contract, which was where you're not [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2212.18s)]
*  delivering a physical good. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2216.14s)]
*  And that's basically what weather derivatives were and energy derivatives and other kind of [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2218.1s)]
*  indices were created that didn't have a tangible physical supply. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2222.66s)]
*  And it was still kind of shoveled in the in the commodities world. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2227.22s)]
*  That's why the legacy of all this stuff kind of sitting with agriculture. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2230.46s)]
*  Is that the way this is likely going to move forward? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2233.7s)]
*  Is it's going to look like a new extension of exempt commodities and kind of treated like that [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2235.58s)]
*  versus being securities? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2239.98s)]
*  The question you're describing is called market structure. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2241.74s)]
*  You know, what are the definitions going to be? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2245.1s)]
*  Because digital assets can be many things. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2247.34s)]
*  You can have some digital assets are crypto currencies. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2249.78s)]
*  They're actually currencies. Then there's things that are crypto securities. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2252.42s)]
*  Then there's things that are commodities. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2256.06s)]
*  Bitcoin actually is regulated as a commodity right now. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2258.2200000000003s)]
*  And then you've got things that aren't securities or commodities or like collectibles, you know, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2261.2200000000003s)]
*  like NFTs, things like that. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2266.1s)]
*  So there's all these different categories. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2267.86s)]
*  And one of the things that the market needs is just clarity around the definitions so that [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2269.78s)]
*  founders know what the rules of the road are and they can actually just comply with them. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2274.1800000000003s)]
*  So giving them those definitions and describing how a crypto project could start, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2277.94s)]
*  for example, as a security and eventually the protocol could become decentralized enough or [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2285.3s)]
*  maybe it becomes a commodity. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2291.06s)]
*  That whole idea that's called market structure. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2292.7400000000002s)]
*  And there was a bill in the last Congress by French Hill, who is the chair of the House [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2297.06s)]
*  Financial Services Committee now, that passed the House with 71 Democratic votes. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2301.2599999999998s)]
*  So it was fairly bipartisan. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2307.02s)]
*  But then it went nowhere in the Senate because, frankly, the Bank Committee at that time was [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2309.3799999999997s)]
*  run by Sherrod Brown, who is anti-crypto. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2314.22s)]
*  So it got stopped in the Senate right away. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2316.54s)]
*  Now we have Republican control of the Senate. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2319.1s)]
*  And Tim Scott's the new chair of the Senate Banking Committee, and he's expressed support. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2321.7s)]
*  So I think now we could get a bill on market structure like FIT 21, again, which was [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2325.14s)]
*  French Hill's bill last Congress. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2329.94s)]
*  I think we could do a revised and updated version this Congress. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2332.1800000000003s)]
*  And that was one of the things they all, the chairman expressed support for. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2335.7000000000003s)]
*  So I think there's a pretty good chance we could get this done in the next six months. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2339.2200000000003s)]
*  What's the opposition, Sachs? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2342.1800000000003s)]
*  I guess it feels to me like with the market structure question being addressed and answered, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2343.58s)]
*  you would have also more protection for consumers because now businesses know the rules of the [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2348.98s)]
*  road. They follow the structure that protects consumers, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2353.06s)]
*  Why would people be opposed to moving this forward, moving the legislation forward, getting [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2356.86s)]
*  this all behind us? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2360.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think this is an area where there's a really good chance of having bipartisan [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2361.9s)]
*  support. We did in the last Congress, like I mentioned, that the House bill got over 70 [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2367.54s)]
*  Democratic votes. I think in the Senate, we're going to need seven votes, seven [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2372.38s)]
*  Democrat votes to get to 60, right, which is the number you need if you don't go through [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2377.38s)]
*  the reconciliation process. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2381.86s)]
*  And I think there's a good chance this passes with significant Democratic support as well as [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2383.78s)]
*  Republican. It's not going to be unanimous or anything like that because there are still [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2388.0600000000004s)]
*  forces that are hostile to crypto in Washington. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2393.3s)]
*  You think it's going to be a discreet bill or do you? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2398.34s)]
*  I mean, it seems like you're going to have to get a border security and energy and [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2400.5800000000004s)]
*  budget bill passed. So it seems like everything's looking towards reconciliation. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2407.98s)]
*  In which case, would this be an adjunct like an add on? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2413.86s)]
*  The question is what you can get through reconciliation. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2417.98s)]
*  So in order for a bill to go through the reconciliation process where you only need [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2420.26s)]
*  basically 50 votes, it has to have a budgetary impact or predominantly a budgetary [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2424.42s)]
*  impact. I think it's called the Byrd rule. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2430.1800000000003s)]
*  And that rule was definitely pushed pretty hard in the last administration. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2432.6600000000003s)]
*  Remember that the Biden administration got the Inflation Reduction Act passed through [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2437.5800000000004s)]
*  reconciliation and all those subsidies for clean energy or whatever. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2442.54s)]
*  So they've opened the window pretty wide on what can go through reconciliation. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2446.82s)]
*  But that's the question. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2450.94s)]
*  There's one other bill that I think is going to move pretty quickly here, too. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2452.5s)]
*  So I just mentioned the market structure bill. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2456.22s)]
*  The other area is stable coins. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2457.74s)]
*  And Senator Hagerty, he's on the banking committee. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2460.2599999999998s)]
*  He just released a stable coin bill. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2463.98s)]
*  There's counterparts in the House. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2465.54s)]
*  And what the four chairmen indicated is actually they're going to take up stable [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2467.42s)]
*  coins first and then market structure will follow very quickly. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2471.5s)]
*  So I think we could see a stable coin bill. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2475.14s)]
*  Pass Congress in the next several months. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2478.34s)]
*  Sax, I guess the question is the SEC was. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2480.46s)]
*  And Gary Gensler were the blocker previously with crypto. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2485.18s)]
*  And they just said, hey, listen, there's an existing set of rules here. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2489.82s)]
*  Just follow those rules. Obviously, those rules don't exactly apply to the innovation [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2492.42s)]
*  happening in crypto. So the question, I think, after stable coins, which feels like a [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2496.78s)]
*  layup and a great place to start, that'll be a great early win. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2501.26s)]
*  And it just makes people I guess that would just reinforce the dollar supremacy, right? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2504.6200000000003s)]
*  It's tied to the dollar. So that's good for America. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2509.26s)]
*  But maybe you could talk to protecting consumers, because we all saw in the first [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2512.3s)]
*  couple of generations of crypto, all kinds of griffs and ICOs and things that were [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2517.26s)]
*  never delivered. So how do you balance those two things? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2521.7000000000003s)]
*  Protecting consumers who may get really enthusiastic about this versus, you know, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2524.7400000000002s)]
*  people who might try to prey upon them? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2530.98s)]
*  Well, the first thing you want to do if you're going to protect consumers is you want to [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2534.22s)]
*  bring the activity onshore. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2537.2599999999998s)]
*  Because obviously, when all the activity gets driven offshore, then it's hard for [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2539.58s)]
*  regulators to supervise it. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2544.5s)]
*  And moreover, it's hard for the market to know who's a good actor, who's a bad actor, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2546.22s)]
*  what's a good project, what's a bad project. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2550.2599999999998s)]
*  So the first thing you want to do is have the innovation happen onshore in the United [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2552.42s)]
*  States. By the way, it's probably not a coincidence that the biggest fraud in the [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2556.02s)]
*  history of crypto, which was FTX, was based in the Bahamas. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2559.42s)]
*  Yeah, a little bit of a tell. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2563.7400000000002s)]
*  A little bit of a tell. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2565.38s)]
*  And it'll be an even stronger tell when the good projects feel like they can come back [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2566.58s)]
*  into the United States. And then you've got the shady ones in the Bahamas or in other [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2570.2200000000003s)]
*  countries, they're going to stick out like a sore thumb. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2574.3s)]
*  Everyone's going to be able to understand that, oh, those guys are too shady to operate [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2575.94s)]
*  in the United States. So the number one thing we need to do is bring the innovation [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2579.98s)]
*  onshore. In terms of the framework, I think the market structure bill is going to [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2583.7400000000002s)]
*  define here's a security, here's a commodity, here's what you have to do. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2588.14s)]
*  Here are the disclosure requirements around creating a crypto project. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2591.74s)]
*  So all of that will be in the bill. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2597.54s)]
*  And then in the meantime, the SEC has created a new task force under Hester [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2599.3399999999997s)]
*  Purce, who's a SEC commissioner, and she is already starting to do work in that [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2604.42s)]
*  regard to define a better regime at the SEC for crypto projects. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2609.2599999999998s)]
*  You mentioned that Gensler said that the SEC's doors were open to crypto companies [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2615.3s)]
*  and they should come in and talk to us and work with us. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2621.1000000000004s)]
*  That was very disingenuous. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2623.7400000000002s)]
*  Crypto companies would tell me they would go see the SEC. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2626.02s)]
*  The SEC would tell them nothing about what the rules were, but they would have [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2629.0600000000004s)]
*  enforcement people in those meetings just writing down everything they would say. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2632.46s)]
*  And the next day they would get sent a Wells notice. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2635.6600000000003s)]
*  So the truth is the SEC was not cooperating. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2637.82s)]
*  They were not providing any clarity. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2640.7000000000003s)]
*  They were just honeypotting founders basically to come in and then they would [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2642.22s)]
*  immediately investigate them. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2646.18s)]
*  I mean, it was really terrible. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2647.5s)]
*  Look, we expect founders to play by the rules and abide by the law and be [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2648.8599999999997s)]
*  compliant, but when you won't tell them what the rules are and then you prosecute [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2653.5s)]
*  them, there's no fair way for them to comply. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2656.9s)]
*  So the most important thing is to give them a framework. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2660.5s)]
*  I think the SEC now is doing that. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2662.66s)]
*  They're starting to do that already. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2664.5s)]
*  And then legislatively, we're going to have a bill that does that, moving [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2665.98s)]
*  through Congress over the next few months. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2669.98s)]
*  This is absolutely awesome. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2672.22s)]
*  We're super encouraged that you're doing this and we really appreciate you [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2673.62s)]
*  coming on the pod. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2677.22s)]
*  Wish you could participate in the other three or four crazy discussions we're [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2678.98s)]
*  about to have, but we understand you've got to stay focused on the mission. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2681.98s)]
*  Anything on the AI front that we can look forward to in the coming weeks that [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2685.8599999999997s)]
*  you're working on? I know that's the other part of your mission. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2689.9s)]
*  Well, the big thing is, like I talked about last time, the president rescinded [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2693.2599999999998s)]
*  the Biden EO, which was this hundred page monstrosity. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2697.02s)]
*  It burned some regulation on our AI companies. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2699.58s)]
*  I think that decision's been proven even more right in the wake of DeepSeek [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2702.5s)]
*  because we know that China has basically caught up or they're very, very close [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2706.5s)]
*  to catching up. It felt like that Biden EO was written in a vacuum in which the [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2710.5s)]
*  U.S. was the only player in AI. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2714.66s)]
*  And that if we imposed a bunch of burn some rules on our companies, that [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2716.7s)]
*  somehow that wouldn't allow China to catch up. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2720.42s)]
*  Right. And I think it's pretty clear that China is very, very competitive. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2722.66s)]
*  If we hobble our AI companies, it's going to run down to China's benefits. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2725.94s)]
*  So I think that was a very good decision. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2730.54s)]
*  And what the president said in his EO is that we should devise a new [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2732.5s)]
*  AI action plan to replace that Biden EO. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2737.3s)]
*  And we're working on that right now. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2740.06s)]
*  All right, David, any anecdotes from Doge you want to share? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2742.2200000000003s)]
*  I'll give you one anecdote, which is I've been working late here a number of [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2745.34s)]
*  nights at the EOB. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2748.98s)]
*  And I won't tell you where the Doge guys are based, but I know where their office [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2750.7000000000003s)]
*  is. So I just went by there to say hi. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2753.7s)]
*  The whole room was full of young coders. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2755.8199999999997s)]
*  I think they were engineers, but they're wearing like suits and ties. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2759.94s)]
*  So that's a little different. But they were all working really late. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2762.46s)]
*  I mean, they're working there late Friday night and the facilities people [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2765.74s)]
*  don't know what to do because they've never had people like asked to stay late [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2770.74s)]
*  on Friday night before. So they've had to create new facilities [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2773.8999999999996s)]
*  access for these guys. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2778.46s)]
*  They're like, you're coming to the office and doing work. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2780.7799999999997s)]
*  We don't have a protocol for that. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2782.7s)]
*  How does that work? I'm going to need to get you a key or a badge to come to the [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2785.06s)]
*  building. Well, it's absolutely awesome to see the progress you're making in the [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2788.42s)]
*  first two weeks and continued success. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2793.42s)]
*  We're so proud of the effort. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2795.66s)]
*  All right. Thanks, guys. All right. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2799.02s)]
*  Do you guys think the Democrats are going to lose people over their opposition [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2801.8199999999997s)]
*  to Doge? Like, is Doge really viewed as oppositional to Democrat party interests? [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2807.06s)]
*  This is for the average person. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2812.8199999999997s)]
*  It's a Rorschach task. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2814.8599999999997s)]
*  I think the thing is that there was a coalition that the Democrats had and there [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2816.14s)]
*  was a coalition that the Republicans had. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2820.2599999999998s)]
*  The Republicans did a better job of reforming that coalition. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2823.02s)]
*  And now I think what you're going to see is a shrinking. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2827.9s)]
*  I actually got this totally wrong. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2830.58s)]
*  I don't know if you remember a couple of years ago, but my thought at the time [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2832.06s)]
*  was if the Republicans don't figure out how to fix themselves, they were going to [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2835.58s)]
*  go and lose for the next 10 or 15 years. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2841.18s)]
*  And the reason I said that was they would walk into every midterm and they would [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2844.7s)]
*  just get their ass handed to them. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2847.54s)]
*  But I think they figured it out that this is sort of this thing that I've been [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2849.74s)]
*  thinking about a lot is there's a fight in Western societies and it's a pendulum [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2853.1s)]
*  between labor and capital. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2859.14s)]
*  And it used to be the thought, the conventional wisdom was that the Republicans [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2861.5s)]
*  were pro-capital and Democrats were pro-labor. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2866.1s)]
*  And the brilliance of Trump is he took over the Republican Party and made it [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2870.58s)]
*  totally populist, which is to say pro-labor. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2874.66s)]
*  And the crazy thing about the Democrats is that they are the most sophisticated liars. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2878.46s)]
*  Because if you look at what happened under Biden, you had record high stock [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2886.8599999999997s)]
*  markets, so it was purely in favor of asset owners, record high deficits, record [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2892.2599999999998s)]
*  high illegal immigration, record high wage suppression. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2898.3s)]
*  All of these things are massively pro-capital, but they tried to present [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2902.82s)]
*  themselves as pro-labor. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2905.82s)]
*  That entire ruse is now being undone. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2907.78s)]
*  And all of this data, what that does is it'll consolidate the Democrats to a [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2910.98s)]
*  shell of their former self. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2915.34s)]
*  It'll take a year or 18 months. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2916.7000000000003s)]
*  But I think unless they figure out how to totally hard reset, they're going to be [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2919.82s)]
*  in a really difficult struggle to find a cohort of people beyond 15 or 20% of [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2923.82s)]
*  the population for a long time. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2929.5800000000004s)]
*  Well, and it's so dumb to come out against waste, fraud and abuse. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2931.26s)]
*  So the best argument the Democrats had, it seems, was that, oh my God, people's [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2935.2200000000003s)]
*  social security numbers or people's privacy was being violated because they went [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2941.1400000000003s)]
*  in and looked at the data and how the money was wasted. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2946.78s)]
*  This is the height of not getting the point and not reading room. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2950.7400000000002s)]
*  A hundred percent of Americans don't want their tax payments stolen. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2955.1800000000003s)]
*  They don't care if you looked at their social security number. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2959.86s)]
*  This isn't a privacy issue that Doge is looking at some database. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2962.46s)]
*  And that's what AOC and Schumer were doing. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2966.26s)]
*  Oh my God, these people are looking at your social security number. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2969.1s)]
*  They have access to your records. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2972.78s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2974.46s)]
*  What matters is how much money is being stolen from the American public. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2975.2200000000003s)]
*  And anyone at any point in time could have picked up this issue. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2979.7000000000003s)]
*  This has been going on. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2983.38s)]
*  I think you pointed out the last time somebody really addressed [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2984.7000000000003s)]
*  this in earnest was Clinton. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2987.42s)]
*  So this has been going on. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2989.26s)]
*  Obama, Trump 1.0, Biden, everybody has been raising the debt. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2991.1800000000003s)]
*  All of this grift has been going on. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2996.78s)]
*  It's only this time around that somebody picked up the free money and said, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=2998.1800000000003s)]
*  here's an issue. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3002.02s)]
*  Now we see what happens when somebody picks up the issue of stop wasting money. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3002.8999999999996s)]
*  It is a popular issue. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3009.8999999999996s)]
*  This is only going to make Trump more popular. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3011.3799999999997s)]
*  So Jason, I'm going to add to what you and Chamath said. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3013.9399999999996s)]
*  I think you're both right. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3017.22s)]
*  Let me give you a very concrete example. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3017.9799999999996s)]
*  Rahm Emanuel is now back from Japan. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3019.9799999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3021.8599999999997s)]
*  He was chief of staff in both the democratic White Houses, post Roosevelt, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3022.1s)]
*  Clinton and Obama. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3027.74s)]
*  And he wrote an op-ed this weekend, this past weekend. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3029.14s)]
*  They basically said the Democrats have lost their way because they have [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3032.18s)]
*  forgotten what he calls kitchen table issues. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3035.5s)]
*  The things people, regular people care about. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3038.54s)]
*  And Chamath, you're right. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3040.66s)]
*  I mean, the reality is they forgot about inflation. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3041.74s)]
*  They forgot that inflation is terrible for the average person. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3045.18s)]
*  It's terrible for middle-class America. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3048.58s)]
*  It's okay for people that own productive assets because they just go up in value, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3050.02s)]
*  but it's terrible for people that are wage earners and that have any savings. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3054.14s)]
*  Terrible for older people that are living off savings. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3057.3399999999997s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3059.66s)]
*  You know, Rahm makes this point that if the Democrats are going to reconform in [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3060.94s)]
*  some way, reform in some way, they're going to have to recapture these kitchen [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3064.7799999999997s)]
*  table issues. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3068.86s)]
*  And if they don't, they'll just be about these fringe social issues, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3069.94s)]
*  DEI, transgender, whatever, and that will never work. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3072.66s)]
*  They'll never come back into power. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3076.1s)]
*  Well, I mean, the crazy thing is like the democratic policies are meant to favor [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3077.46s)]
*  capital holders, but capital holders by and large deeply dislike the Democrats [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3081.58s)]
*  because of all of these other issues. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3086.66s)]
*  So they have no home. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3088.3399999999997s)]
*  There is no base from which to build from right now, unless they go through a [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3089.62s)]
*  great reset. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3093.58s)]
*  And part of it is that they have to understand that they are actually not pro [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3094.74s)]
*  labor. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3099.86s)]
*  They are, have been pro capital, but that requires such a schism from the deepest [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3100.9s)]
*  believers of the democratic party who thought, you know, eat the rich, you wear [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3106.54s)]
*  it on your dress. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3111.1s)]
*  It's so important to you. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3111.9s)]
*  In fact, actually you were feeding the rich. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3112.98s)]
*  You just, and the fact that you didn't even know that is just pathetic. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3115.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3119.7s)]
*  And what's funny is that, you know, Margaret Thatcher famously said that the [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3119.9s)]
*  problem is socialism. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3122.5s)]
*  You eventually run out of other people's money and you run deficits, right? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3123.2599999999998s)]
*  And you destroy the country. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3126.74s)]
*  This happened in Venezuela. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3127.54s)]
*  It's always the end of socialism. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3128.46s)]
*  It's how it, it's how it finishes, how the movie ends. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3129.7s)]
*  We've seen it around the world. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3131.5s)]
*  Just look, look South into South America. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3133.02s)]
*  We were heading that direction. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3136.1s)]
*  That's when I said earlier, we, I was, I'm afraid we might become a kleptocracy if [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3137.02s)]
*  this doesn't stop. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3141.38s)]
*  And I'm so grateful to all the great Patriots at Doge and the government, the [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3142.14s)]
*  president for making it happen because we were heading that direction. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3145.18s)]
*  So the democratic party is lost. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3148.1s)]
*  They'll continue to be lost. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3149.94s)]
*  Interesting thing came up this week on Monday, president Trump signed an [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3151.94s)]
*  executive order, laying out a plan to establish the first sovereign wealth [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3155.94s)]
*  fund for the United States. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3160.34s)]
*  For those of you who don't know, a sovereign wealth fund is essentially an [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3161.58s)]
*  investment fund for our country. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3164.58s)]
*  It's almost universally based on natural resources. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3167.06s)]
*  So Norway, Saudi UAE, they all have Australia sovereign wealth funds based [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3170.86s)]
*  upon minerals or typically oil. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3177.1s)]
*  The United States is not known for having the oil reserves of the Saudis or UAE [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3179.94s)]
*  or Norway, this public investment fund. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3186.02s)]
*  Would be apparently anchored by potentially the tick tock shares that [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3190.2999999999997s)]
*  Trump said he wanted to get half of by giving a license. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3198.7s)]
*  A lot of that is unclear what this license would be. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3204.78s)]
*  It's never existed, but this is the concept. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3208.26s)]
*  The treasury secretary and commerce secretary have been tasked with [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3212.38s)]
*  developing a plan over the next 90 days. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3215.9s)]
*  And the plan should include quote recommendations for funding mechanisms, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3219.7400000000002s)]
*  investment strategies, fund structure, and a governance model. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3224.02s)]
*  Chamath, you were tweeting about this. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3227.58s)]
*  What is the point of having a sovereign wealth fund in the United States? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3229.7799999999997s)]
*  If we're $36 trillion in debt, shouldn't we just pay down? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3234.9799999999996s)]
*  Or I think it's not, it's not money going to come from. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3239.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3243.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, it's not an either or thing. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3243.7799999999997s)]
*  And I think the point is that if there are assets that are minted effectively [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3244.9399999999996s)]
*  overnight, which I think the 50% share of tick tock would be, so call it a [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3249.4599999999996s)]
*  hundred, $150 billion, the question is, what should you do with it? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3253.3799999999997s)]
*  And who should govern it? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3257.8599999999997s)]
*  And I think this idea that if you had a group of five elder statesmen, so I'm [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3258.82s)]
*  just going to throw some names out there. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3263.1000000000004s)]
*  David Tepper, Stan Druckenmiller, Ken Griffin, John Doar or Mike Moritz, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3264.5s)]
*  Bill Gross, or some other bond guy. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3270.1800000000003s)]
*  My point is what you get are five people that are very sophisticated [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3272.38s)]
*  across all market categories. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3276.7400000000002s)]
*  One of them could be the rotating CEO for some number of years. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3279.2200000000003s)]
*  People should rotate in and rotate out. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3282.5800000000004s)]
*  These are unpaid jobs because everybody that has these slots should be [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3284.5400000000004s)]
*  mega billionaires. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3288.6600000000003s)]
*  So they shouldn't be doing it for their own personal advancement and they [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3289.58s)]
*  should deploy that capital. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3292.7400000000002s)]
*  So as you sell down the tick tock shares, maybe as you sell federal lands and you [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3294.1800000000003s)]
*  generate more oil revenue, take it all and invest it on behalf of America into [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3298.6600000000003s)]
*  American companies. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3304.34s)]
*  I think that's a great, incredible idea. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3305.1400000000003s)]
*  Antonio, you think the government should be in this business? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3308.86s)]
*  So I have, I think it should, but, and I agree with Shamath, uh, that the [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3312.54s)]
*  governance is very, very important. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3317.06s)]
*  I think he's got a good idea there. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3318.26s)]
*  I think it for a different reason is that we don't have an industrial policy in [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3321.2200000000003s)]
*  America. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3324.6600000000003s)]
*  Uh, many of our strategic competitors around the world, in particular China, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3325.7400000000002s)]
*  have a long-term industrial policy and they put enormous amounts of capital [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3328.82s)]
*  behind the industrial policy. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3333.42s)]
*  Uh, a sovereign wealth fund, I think would be a stealthy way to create [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3335.0600000000004s)]
*  industrial policy in America. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3338.98s)]
*  So what does it mean industrial policy in this context? [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3340.1800000000003s)]
*  So example in China, they want to, they want to build chip fabs and they want to [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3342.3s)]
*  catch up to, to, uh, TSMC. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3347.38s)]
*  So what do they do? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3350.94s)]
*  They take the dollars of trade surplus they get from us every year and they [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3351.9s)]
*  pour it back into making that stuff inside their country. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3356.02s)]
*  And for decades, part of the problem we've had with China is that capital's [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3358.5s)]
*  free because the banking system just pushes money out to manufacturers and [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3362.54s)]
*  they move the manufacturing cause the WTO from the U S to China. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3365.54s)]
*  That's industrial policy. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3368.38s)]
*  People say the Chinese have a long-term a hundred year vision. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3369.38s)]
*  The way it's, it manifests is this industrial policy. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3372.1800000000003s)]
*  We don't have that here at all. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3375.46s)]
*  And when we try to do it, we do like the chips act and it goes through commerce. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3376.62s)]
*  We have government bureaucrats deciding how to spend $200 billion to [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3380.02s)]
*  modernize Intel, which needs to happen. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3384.54s)]
*  I mean, I'd much rather have Ken Griffin, Bill Gross, any of the guys [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3386.7000000000003s)]
*  Chimoth mentioned deciding, okay, we have five industries in America [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3390.9s)]
*  we want to invest in, let's make great investments, right? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3394.42s)]
*  I mean, let's make great investments for America. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3396.98s)]
*  They've got to be economic. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3398.2200000000003s)]
*  They got to, they got to make money for us, but they got to be good for the country. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3399.2200000000003s)]
*  I think that's what most sovereign wealth funds do. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3402.3s)]
*  Some of them make portfolio investments, but many of them, like the, the [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3403.9s)]
*  sovereign wealth and Saudi Arabia, the PIF, they're making enormous investments [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3406.7000000000003s)]
*  domestically to remake the economy, you know, toward tourism example. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3409.58s)]
*  And I think this is a great idea. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3414.1800000000003s)]
*  They're literally building cities in New York. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3415.1s)]
*  They've got, you know, a dozen cities being constructed and trying to take an [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3417.26s)]
*  oil economy and shift it to a tourism economy, a technology economy, a [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3422.38s)]
*  private equity economy. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3427.54s)]
*  Antonio's totally right. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3428.7400000000002s)]
*  Like Scott Besson, part of his congressional testimony, you guys probably [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3429.82s)]
*  saw this was he laid out this thing that he has that's called the 333 plan, right? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3434.86s)]
*  And the 333 plan says we want to see GDP growth of 3%. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3439.3s)]
*  We want to see deficits that are no greater than 3% and we want to have 3 [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3443.7400000000002s)]
*  million barrels of oil, right? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3447.9s)]
*  Produced domestically in the United States. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3449.5800000000004s)]
*  But if you double click on that, if you look at the total energy reserves in the [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3451.46s)]
*  United States, they're three times greater than the total energy reserves of [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3456.02s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, three times across all forms. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3460.34s)]
*  So not just oil, if you oil, not gas plus coal. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3463.5s)]
*  If we actually go, as Antonio said, towards an industrial policy that's pro [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3466.9s)]
*  energy, where the incremental cost of energy is effectively zero, where we want [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3472.1s)]
*  just a gross abundance of electrons flowing in America for all the great ideas [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3476.42s)]
*  that could pop up. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3481.46s)]
*  It is by definition going to generate an enormous amount of revenue for the [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3483.2200000000003s)]
*  federal government. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3487.78s)]
*  And so I think having the sovereign wealth fund be the rainy day fund, if you [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3489.2200000000003s)]
*  will, right, that can bank a percentage of all of that, I think starts to do a [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3493.26s)]
*  lot of really good for the long-term strategic guidance of the U.S. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3497.5s)]
*  Freberg, what do you think here? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3502.62s)]
*  Is this something where we're making the government too big and now we've got the [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3503.9s)]
*  government competing with BlackRock and Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz, and [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3507.78s)]
*  they're going to be on the board of technology companies and energy companies [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3511.7000000000003s)]
*  and investing in it. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3515.5800000000004s)]
*  And then what happens when, you know, Obama, Biden, Trump, Bush, you get [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3516.42s)]
*  different people running these things and then they want to do their pet projects. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3521.2200000000003s)]
*  It seems to me like this could be get awfully conflicted, awfully quick. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3524.5800000000004s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3527.98s)]
*  Should this be a business our government's in? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3528.6200000000003s)]
*  I think one of the things the government sucks at is capitalism. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3531.34s)]
*  So I wouldn't make capitalism the mandate of a sovereign wealth fund. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3534.3s)]
*  Certainly not when we have $40 trillion of federal debt. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3538.62s)]
*  It doesn't make economic sense. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3541.58s)]
*  Our cost of capital is 5%. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3542.98s)]
*  That's how much the interest is on this 10 to 30 year debt right now. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3544.98s)]
*  So it's very hard to actually make real risk adjusted returns when our cost of [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3550.02s)]
*  capital is so high. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3554.3s)]
*  So I don't think the mandate should be, hey, let's put a bunch of capital in a [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3555.38s)]
*  pool, go and invest it and probably make money for the United States. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3558.06s)]
*  That seems silly. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3562.18s)]
*  But my point about the government being really bad at capitalism is that the [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3563.2999999999997s)]
*  United States government owns and has access to and will acquire through other [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3566.8599999999997s)]
*  means, significant assets and resources that should be monetized in a smarter way. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3571.98s)]
*  And so I would kind of think about the sovereign wealth fund as being more of a [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3577.8599999999997s)]
*  strategic vehicle for monetization of high value government assets. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3580.8599999999997s)]
*  So for example, if Trump does actually negotiate a 50% equity position in TikTok [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3585.94s)]
*  US, that needs to sit somewhere. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3590.22s)]
*  It should not sit in the department of whatever. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3592.74s)]
*  It should sit with a capitalist manager that then ultimately makes the decision [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3595.74s)]
*  on when and how to monetize that asset, return that cash to the treasury and pay [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3599.7s)]
*  down the debt. Similarly, the US has large amounts of land, has access to other [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3603.98s)]
*  large assets that get transferred in seizures, et cetera, et cetera. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3609.98s)]
*  So, you know, I don't know if you guys remember all this, but there was a bit [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3613.66s)]
*  Bitcoin seizures that have happened over the years. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3616.3399999999997s)]
*  Is the government has cracked down on criminal enterprises, then the government [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3619.1800000000003s)]
*  owns this Bitcoin. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3622.1400000000003s)]
*  Do you think the smartest people are making the decisions on where and how to [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3623.3s)]
*  sell down that Bitcoin? [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3625.98s)]
*  I guarantee you not. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3627.3s)]
*  I would much rather have a capitalist making that decision. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3628.2200000000003s)]
*  So I would view the, you know, the sovereign wealth fund being less about [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3630.7000000000003s)]
*  raised capital from other means in the government, which effectively means [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3634.34s)]
*  borrowing money through treasuries because of the debt level we have and [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3637.1000000000004s)]
*  trying to invest it and much more being about, okay, what strategic assets can [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3641.02s)]
*  the US government monetize and use this as the mechanism for doing that? [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3645.42s)]
*  And then ultimately, I think the objective should be to return that capital. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3649.42s)]
*  I do think there's also an opportunity for managing social security in a smarter [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3652.98s)]
*  way. So social security is functionally going to be bankrupt in eight years. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3657.6600000000003s)]
*  The way the trust is set up, the cash that's there, the assets that are there [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3662.58s)]
*  and the demand on social security given the aging population and the rising pay [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3666.9s)]
*  outs every year. So one of the other ways to think about this is what are the long [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3672.3s)]
*  term debt obligations, which is ultimately the point of the sovereign wealth funds [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3676.7000000000003s)]
*  and can they be invested in smarter way? [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3680.7400000000002s)]
*  Why is the social security entities ultimately owning, you know, 3% yielding bonds [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3681.98s)]
*  when they could be owning interest in inequities? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3686.94s)]
*  So I would kind of think about that strategic pool of capital being managed by this [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3690.0600000000004s)]
*  as well and less about the mandate of go be a capitalist investor for the United [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3694.3s)]
*  States, raise money and make money. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3698.9s)]
*  I think leave that to the markets. But when it comes to strategic assets, I think this [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3701.1800000000003s)]
*  could be a good vehicle for when the Silk Road got shut down. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3704.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we seized 144,000 Bitcoin and that's sitting somewhere in some Department of [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3708.2200000000003s)]
*  Justice. Yeah, they sold. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3714.1400000000003s)]
*  I think they sold it. Yeah, no, I think we still have. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3716.5s)]
*  I think that was like the idea was that was going to become the Bitcoin. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3719.86s)]
*  I mean, you could also come up with the taxes to fund the DOJ. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3723.1800000000003s)]
*  The DOJ sells these. So like, who do you think of the DOJ is making the Bitcoin [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3726.1000000000004s)]
*  market decisions? And is that the right person to be monetizing these assets? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3729.82s)]
*  I mean, David, you put out security. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3733.46s)]
*  I just want to follow up on which is. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3735.94s)]
*  When you think about social security, it's six, six dollars of our 30 strong debt, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3738.82s)]
*  and it's actually a fake treasury bill. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3745.6200000000003s)]
*  So just one of the things we figured out early days before the inauguration, I [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3747.94s)]
*  don't know, it's like that's extremely dollars that's on the ledger. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3752.78s)]
*  It's just a paper ledger over. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3754.9s)]
*  So actually, if it gets paid out, it's also be very inflationary. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3756.42s)]
*  It's just a fake treasury I ledgered over that pays a very low rate. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3758.8599999999997s)]
*  And here at Valero, my partner, John Shulkin, has been reading. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3762.8599999999997s)]
*  To try to help the only the only thing we find is audit in the government. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3767.14s)]
*  The Social Security Administration actually has an audit. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3770.5s)]
*  It has an audit. And when you go through the audit, it's crazy. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3773.54s)]
*  The material weakness is going back to DOJ that you find. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3777.02s)]
*  Yeah, it'd be way better to have that invest in a way that was economic [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3780.46s)]
*  for people with real money. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3783.2999999999997s)]
*  That's the thing, and as they're pressing for this guys, as we're [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3784.7s)]
*  speaking, the federal judge just put a temporary restraining order on DOJ [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3787.7400000000002s)]
*  and has barred Elon and his team from accessing U.S. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3792.98s)]
*  Treasury payments data. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3795.5s)]
*  All right. So now we're going to have. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3797.66s)]
*  A real grudge match between the public, the federal, which judge was it? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3801.7s)]
*  Federal judge, federal judge. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3806.54s)]
*  Would you know why two months to say why? [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3808.26s)]
*  No, but Elizabeth Warren is doing a victory lap. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3810.26s)]
*  So I'm sure that, you know. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3814.06s)]
*  She's part of it. So the government agency set up by the president can't look at the. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3817.22s)]
*  Database of the Treasury. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3822.86s)]
*  So just to be a double click here, DOJ. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3824.5s)]
*  Is that a new agency? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3828.82s)]
*  It's the renaming of existing need to say Kimber, the name of it, what to find it. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3830.02s)]
*  Elon tweeted about this some weeks ago. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3833.14s)]
*  That was set up under Obama, actually, to do this, to create [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3836.5s)]
*  an audit function to the government. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3841.46s)]
*  What's crazy about this ruling to me is Congress basically [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3843.06s)]
*  the Constitution delegates to the executive, the the ability to spend the money [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3848.62s)]
*  and they go through Congress. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3852.58s)]
*  It gets actually appropriate in Congress and the executive spends it. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3853.62s)]
*  How can you spend money if you don't know where it went? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3855.98s)]
*  How can you be responsible? Right. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3860.18s)]
*  You have the authority to spend it, but not the and how can you responsibly spend it [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3861.2599999999998s)]
*  if you actually can't go look and see where it goes? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3864.14s)]
*  Guys, this is flying fast and furious. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3866.7799999999997s)]
*  President Trump just unveiled his framework for his tax plan. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3869.18s)]
*  No tax on tips, no tax on senior social security, no tax on overtime pay. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3874.06s)]
*  Renew the middle class tax cuts, adjust the salt cap. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3879.2999999999997s)]
*  So again, very pro, as I said, pro labor, pro populist. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3882.82s)]
*  Eliminate all special tax breaks for billionaire sports team owners. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3886.34s)]
*  Oh, all right. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3889.94s)]
*  I already sold the team. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3891.9s)]
*  I already sold my piece. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3892.98s)]
*  I already sold my piece. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3894.2599999999998s)]
*  Oops. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3895.7s)]
*  Close the carried interest tax. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3897.5s)]
*  I didn't close the carried interest tax deduction loophole, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3900.42s)]
*  which allowed you to claim carried interest. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3903.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3906.06s)]
*  Oh, no, please. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3906.86s)]
*  I better run. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3908.58s)]
*  Oh, no. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3909.86s)]
*  I'll be back in a few hours and sell some things. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3910.62s)]
*  Isn't that incredible? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3916.02s)]
*  I mean, he is really going for the jugular. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3916.94s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3918.78s)]
*  Hmm. Amazing. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3919.78s)]
*  I support this 100 percent. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3921.06s)]
*  The salt deductions coming back. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3922.78s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3924.5s)]
*  Yeah, marginally, though, I don't think he's going to give it the way that it was before. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3925.58s)]
*  But isn't this incredible? [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3928.38s)]
*  I mean, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3930.3s)]
*  who's going to stand up and lay on the railroad tracks for being able to amortize [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3931.6600000000003s)]
*  a multibillion dollar sports team purchase or that when you make a fund [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3938.2200000000003s)]
*  investment, you should get long term cap gains treatment? [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3942.86s)]
*  Who is going to be that person in this? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3945.42s)]
*  Nobody's going to stand up for these things. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3947.9s)]
*  I think we should just stop doing venture and just start NGOs. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3949.7400000000002s)]
*  We just start a whole rat's nest of NGOs to ship money around. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3953.38s)]
*  You could have an incubator. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3957.82s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3959.02s)]
*  If you've got a great idea for an NGO, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3961.1s)]
*  why why did you launch launch in every single random developing country in the [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3964.6600000000003s)]

*  Yeah, I can't go launch. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3978.82s)]
*  I love it. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=3981.06s)]

*  biological males playing in female sports leagues, that issue that Trump just did [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4023.9s)]

*  It's just obvious. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4048.34s)]
*  And the fact that the Democrats couldn't see that issue being 100 percent for more [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4049.7s)]
*  95 percent makes no sense. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4057.38s)]
*  Like it's just such an obvious litmus test of logic. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4060.1s)]

*  immigration and the reality is that's why people come here, man. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4077.26s)]
*  It's un-American. It's un-American. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4080.02s)]
*  It's zero degrees. We've got two people here who are immigrants. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4081.86s)]
*  I'm reading the TRO and it looks like this TRO means temporary restraining order. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4084.86s)]
*  And it's actually Nero's Who from Doge can get read access down to two people, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4088.82s)]
*  Tom Pross and Marco Elez. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4095.62s)]
*  Oh, OK, so they don't want to have [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4098.46s)]
*  the whole team be able to see what's at Treasury. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4102.78s)]
*  They just have to have a process and some sign off. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4104.94s)]
*  OK, that sounds not unreasonable. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4107.66s)]
*  I just want to point out to people to look at how good they are. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4110.54s)]
*  I'm sure they're going to work 24-7. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4114.26s)]
*  Look at all the payments. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4115.46s)]
*  The U.S. government is not a lot. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4116.74s)]
*  Yeah, it does seem like it needs to be more than two, but it doesn't seem like [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4118.5s)]
*  they're saying you can't look at it. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4121.46s)]
*  They just want to have some controls in place. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4123.18s)]
*  I mean, it feels to me that's an administrative block. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4126.42s)]
*  That's like the narrowest thing you could do. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4128.62s)]
*  OK, yeah, you can come in, but you can just send two people and just these two people. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4130.38s)]
*  So if they get sick or something happens, no one else comes in. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4135.34s)]
*  That seems to me to be truly just an administrative block to slow it down. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4138.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4142.660000000001s)]
*  Well, we're interpreting this in real time. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4143.9800000000005s)]
*  The facts will come out over time. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4145.9400000000005s)]
*  Let's wrap up on Google. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4147.780000000001s)]
*  Google dropped 7 percent after reporting earnings on Tuesday. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4149.700000000001s)]
*  Martha revenue up 12 percent year over year to 96.5 billion. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4153.14s)]
*  Wow. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4157.42s)]
*  Cloud revenue is up 30 percent year over year. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4158.38s)]
*  Twelve billion YouTube ads searching 14 percent to 10.5 billion. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4160.660000000001s)]
*  Net profit was around 26.5 billion up 28 percent year over year. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4165.740000000001s)]
*  So they are really focusing on profitability. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4170.860000000001s)]
*  Obviously, four year numbers. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4173.9800000000005s)]
*  This is just extraordinary. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4175.9400000000005s)]
*  Total revenue, 350 billion with 100 billion in net profit. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4177.26s)]
*  Cloud and YouTube finished 2024 with a combined run rate of 110 billion dollars. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4182.26s)]
*  YouTube is basically Netflix inside of [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4188.02s)]
*  inside of Google and their Google Cloud is essentially AWS inside of Google. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4190.780000000001s)]
*  The thing that made investors get concerned, Chamath, is that Google said it [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4196.62s)]
*  would invest 75 billion in CapEx in 2025, 42 percent jump over 2024, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4200.900000000001s)]
*  29 percent more than analysts expect. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4208.1s)]
*  Obviously, this has to do with data center servers and the AI build out. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4210.54s)]
*  What do you think about that number? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4215.7s)]
*  Seventy five billion, obviously in relation to what we saw [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4217.7s)]
*  with DeepSeek doing it with maybe a little bit less, maybe they're lying. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4222.38s)]
*  Is this just an absolute. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4227.58s)]
*  Waste of money or gargantuan number, or is it something they can easily, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4231.22s)]
*  with that amount of profitability and cash they have, absorb and use in the future? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4235.82s)]
*  I think I should stipulate that Google's [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4239.38s)]
*  models are probably the best of all the models across a broad base of. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4241.18s)]
*  Capabilities, if you test for them. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4246.26s)]
*  And so let's start there, which is whatever they're doing is working. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4248.9800000000005s)]
*  The thing that they need to do is be [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4253.14s)]
*  able to translate those models now into better products. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4254.74s)]
*  And I think that that will happen slowly, like, for example, if you look at deep [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4259.18s)]
*  research, most of the people online that are [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4263.34s)]
*  evaluating deep research would now say that open AI is both faster and just [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4266.3s)]
*  better on the margins, all of these things can be improved. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4271.7s)]
*  I don't think that's a comment on the base model. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4274.7s)]
*  I think it's a comment on post-training [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4276.42s)]
*  and how they're attempting to productize these things. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4278.18s)]
*  So. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4280.9800000000005s)]
*  The other thing that Google has is a money [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4283.14s)]
*  machine that directly benefits from these AI driven optimizations on ad targeting. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4285.54s)]
*  The only other company that has anywhere close to the same credibility is Metta. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4291.3s)]
*  So I think what both of these two companies need to do is do a better job of [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4296.42s)]
*  explaining how that seventy five billion gets segregated. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4301.06s)]
*  How much of that goes to these AI enabled models that actually do better ads [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4304.5s)]
*  optimization? There's a there's a really interesting [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4308.900000000001s)]
*  discussion by a former Metta machine learning engineer on X about how they did [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4311.38s)]
*  it. It's pretty amazing. It's staggering. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4315.1s)]
*  But if they could say half the money goes [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4317.62s)]
*  to that and the other half goes to more speculative pre-training and post-training, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4319.38s)]
*  I think the market would have eaten it up. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4324.0599999999995s)]
*  So it's probably more of a disclosure issue [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4327.42s)]
*  for Google, because I would say right now their model quality is the best. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4329.42s)]
*  You have thoughts on this build out, Antonio, obviously, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4333.98s)]
*  I think you've been involved with XAI and obviously involved with Twitter and X [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4336.98s)]
*  previously and Colossus's colossal build out. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4341.299999999999s)]
*  That was extraordinary to watch in such a short period of time. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4344.66s)]
*  Do you have concerns that, like some people do, that this build out is too [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4347.74s)]
*  expensive and there would be too hard to monetize all that expense? [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4351.46s)]
*  Or is it maybe a little bit of hand wringing and the opportunity in AI is so [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4356.54s)]
*  obviously huge that you just got to take the leap of faith. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4362.06s)]
*  And if you build it, the revenue will come. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4365.02s)]
*  Yeah, I think Chamath has the right [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4369.14s)]
*  framework here, which is return of invested capital. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4370.38s)]
*  And what he's saying by, you know, if Google had said, hey, [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4372.58s)]
*  half the money is for ads and half the money is for post-training, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4375.26s)]
*  the market would have seen that half the money is for higher training capital. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4379.34s)]
*  And Google's training capital is actually [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4381.820000000001s)]
*  going up after the implementation of AI models into their company. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4383.660000000001s)]
*  And I think that sort of abstracts the entire market, which is [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4388.26s)]
*  people are waking up that return of invested capital and data centers will matter, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4391.660000000001s)]
*  that the models are basic commodities and super competitive. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4395.34s)]
*  In the best case, it's kind of a land [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4399.22s)]
*  war in Asia, it's a melee, in the worst case, just total commodities. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4401.18s)]
*  What does matter is the return of capital data center, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4404.42s)]
*  which is influenced by how good the data centers are. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4407.9s)]
*  So you mentioned the XAI data center, it's 100,000 GPU cluster. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4410.179999999999s)]
*  It's the most dense, coherent cluster in the world. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4413.9s)]
*  And it will just train faster and better than other clusters. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4416.26s)]
*  And it's also built for the most cheaply and the fastest. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4419.54s)]
*  So XAI will have the highest training [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4423.74s)]
*  capital and I also think the best train data and therefore win. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4425.139999999999s)]
*  I think Google will also win because they have their TensorFlow chips. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4427.98s)]
*  They make some of their own chips. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4432.179999999999s)]
*  They do focus on ROIC and they have a great monopoly, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4434.22s)]
*  they kind of fund it all. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4437.58s)]
*  So I don't think it's over done and blown. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4438.58s)]
*  I think this is going to be, as you guys said before, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4440.18s)]
*  the podcast, bigger than Industrial Revolution. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4442.3s)]
*  But it's also true that you need to have a good ROIC. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4444.5s)]
*  And if you don't, you're not transparent about it. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4449.86s)]
*  You can see what happens. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4451.62s)]
*  I would argue Google's probably been the most frugal, thoughtful and well-managed [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4452.78s)]
*  computing infrastructure investor of all time. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4459.18s)]
*  You know, the 98 to 2005 era at Google, [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4462.0199999999995s)]
*  it was all about just cheap throwaway racks. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4465.1s)]
*  That was the big advantage they had, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4467.42s)]
*  as they weren't using the expensive Oracle servers. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4469.26s)]
*  And they had a two to three year kind of depreciation timeline on those, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4471.780000000001s)]
*  but they were super cheap and so the ROIC was quite good. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4476.38s)]
*  Then they got into energy efficiency, which they realized was a big driving cost. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4480.3s)]
*  They started to build systems that were more energy efficient. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4483.9400000000005s)]
*  As a result, they lasted longer. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4487.22s)]
*  And then their depreciation schedule moved up to three to four years, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4489.620000000001s)]
*  meaning they could kind of write down the value of the servers over three to four [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4493.42s)]
*  years. And then from 2010 to 2015 era, their hardware system for cloud allowed [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4496.78s)]
*  them to kind of extend through repurposing the utilization. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4505.06s)]
*  And they increased their depreciation to four to five years. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4508.7s)]
*  And then in 2021, I don't know if you guys remember this, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4511.9400000000005s)]
*  they made this kind of big change to their depreciation schedule on data center [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4513.9s)]
*  infrastructure to six years. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4518.86s)]
*  So when they invest CapEx in a data center, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4520.22s)]
*  they would write down the servers over a six year cycle because of AI optimization [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4523.780000000001s)]
*  on maintenance. So they started using AI just for internal [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4527.700000000001s)]
*  management of the infrastructure. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4531.06s)]
*  So I would view the seventy five billion dollar CapEx actually as a very positive [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4533.06s)]
*  signal for the company. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4539.5s)]
*  I think that it means that they have a really strong line of sight on how [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4540.9400000000005s)]
*  they're going to have full utilization and great return on this. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4544.38s)]
*  If you do the math, the ROIC math on the seventy five billion dollars, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4547.94s)]
*  assume a 20 percent ROIC, you've got to be generating, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4551.5s)]
*  call it roughly an incremental 15 billion dollars of profit a year, [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4555.98s)]
*  plus the amortization of the seventy five billion. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4559.86s)]
*  So take the seventy five billion divided by six. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4562.62s)]
*  That's 12 billion plus 15 billion. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4564.82s)]
*  So what there is. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4566.82s)]
*  So basically they would need to make an incremental 27 billion of operating profit [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4567.7s)]
*  a year on the seventy five billion for this to meet their ROIC performance. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4571.66s)]
*  That doesn't seem crazy because that's just under 20 percent of their [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4576.42s)]
*  annual operating profit. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4579.7s)]
*  This is a very kind of, I think, important point, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4581.06s)]
*  which is Google doesn't just do this to build out AI in the future. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4583.58s)]
*  They have a really strong line of sight on how this can kind of increment. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4587.82s)]
*  And you don't have a huge hurdle for them for this to pay back. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4590.38s)]
*  So, I don't know, I would kind of take Antonio's point. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4593.38s)]
*  I view this as a positive. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4595.74s)]
*  I think if you use their historical ability to manage infrastructure and make [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4597.06s)]
*  predictions on investments as an indicator of the future, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4600.86s)]
*  this is a strong and positive indicator. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4603.82s)]
*  And I do think that for all the naysayers out there that think that search is going [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4605.62s)]
*  to evolve to chat, you could look at this as being a really important proof point [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4609.3s)]
*  that Google has the confidence that they're going to be able to move from [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4613.3s)]
*  search to chat. And as Chamath points out, they've got great [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4616.22s)]
*  performative models. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4618.98s)]
*  And I would view this more of as a positive than a negative. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4620.0599999999995s)]
*  If they were under investing, I would be worried that they didn't know where to [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4622.34s)]
*  invest. But to see them make this degree of investment [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4625.0199999999995s)]
*  highlights the confidence in the strategy. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4627.38s)]
*  Antonio, I don't know if you've been watching the age in space or deep research [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4629.9s)]
*  that came out from Google and then closed AI and open AI [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4633.42s)]
*  launched their copycat version of this product. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4637.66s)]
*  Sorry, I don't have short feelings on it. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4641.06s)]
*  I'm curious your thoughts on job displacement. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4643.66s)]
*  We're looking at self-driving. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4647.18s)]
*  Obviously, Waymo's got cars on the road. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4648.82s)]
*  Obviously, Tesla, which you were previously on the board of. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4650.900000000001s)]
*  And I know you were the first institutional investor in Tesla. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4653.74s)]
*  Self-driving is pretty good. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4657.74s)]
*  I only get like one or two disengagements per hour. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4658.9400000000005s)]
*  And they tend to be the ones where I just want to take the turn a little sharper [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4661.78s)]
*  kind of thing. So that's getting pretty close. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4664.94s)]
*  BYD is very close. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4666.82s)]
*  You got a lot of job displacement that occur. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4668.7s)]
*  Millions and millions of drivers in 10 years could lose their jobs. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4672.219999999999s)]
*  Researchers working at Gartner Group, whatever, Boston Consulting Group. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4676.219999999999s)]
*  It feels like there could be massive job displacement. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4681.74s)]
*  Do you have concerns about that in the American economy and globally? [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4685.0599999999995s)]
*  There's a lot of hearing about this. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4689.139999999999s)]
*  And it's real. In prior moments of large disruption, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4690.5s)]
*  that there have been job displacements because there's no generous people to get [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4694.9800000000005s)]
*  retrained for something else. You can't be retrained. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4698.22s)]
*  So I think there were studies, one of the people did, of the steel industry in [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4699.9800000000005s)]
*  Pittsburgh in the 70s that the cost of each steel worker job loss was about a [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4704.3s)]
*  million dollars to the economy because these people couldn't be retrained. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4709.62s)]
*  And that might happen here. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4712.34s)]
*  But I have a more benign outlook personally. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4713.58s)]
*  What I think is going to happen is that you will have job loss. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4716.9800000000005s)]
*  But the amount of productivity that will be released in the U.S. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4720.54s)]
*  economy is going to be extraordinary. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4723.58s)]
*  So GDP growth is a function of the number of people working times productivity. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4726.14s)]
*  It's very simple. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4730.18s)]
*  Economists want to make it more complex than that. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4731.38s)]
*  But the number of people working times productivity. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4733.58s)]
*  If productivity goes up to five, six, seven, eight percent, you get a massive boost [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4735.9800000000005s)]
*  in GDP growth. And then what happens? [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4741.900000000001s)]
*  Well, people can get retrained. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4744.06s)]
*  They can get different jobs. Different services happen. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4746.14s)]
*  People start companies. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4748.42s)]
*  The application layer of LLMs is just starting. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4749.900000000001s)]
*  The barrier to start a company is quite low. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4752.860000000001s)]
*  Things like launch probably explode because there's all these people who don't [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4755.34s)]
*  have jobs anymore that were accountants and want to start something. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4758.5s)]
*  It's hard to know what happens. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4761.02s)]
*  I believe in American agility. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4762.3s)]
*  I believe in this country. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4764.14s)]
*  I believe that we will figure out a way to make this all work. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4765.62s)]
*  And if there's enough productivity and money in the economy that's flowing, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4768.7s)]
*  people will find new jobs. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4772.34s)]
*  They will find new businesses to start. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4774.62s)]
*  They will find new things to do. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4776.02s)]
*  We have to get out of the way, take regulation down and let Americans be [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4777.26s)]
*  creative and unleash the American productivity machine. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4780.860000000001s)]
*  Let's make that happen. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4784.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's I think really strong thoughts. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4786.22s)]
*  And I mean, that's the game we're seeing on the field. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4788.3s)]
*  How many companies are we seeing hit a [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4790.54s)]
*  million dollars in revenue with five employees where that used to take 25? [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4792.38s)]
*  So the efficiencies there, Chamath, your outlook on this issue, since it seems [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4796.9400000000005s)]
*  to be coming up again specifically with truck drivers and Uber drivers and all [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4801.46s)]
*  kinds of other research jobs that seem to be doing pretty well or can be done [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4806.3s)]
*  pretty well by AI, where do you stand on this issue today? [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4812.14s)]
*  I think it's a process. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4815.5s)]
*  Buffett wrote about this in an annual letter. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4816.9800000000005s)]
*  And what he described was the changing [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4819.5s)]
*  nature of jobs during the agrarian revolution. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4822.74s)]
*  And what you saw was a large cohort of people who supported themselves through [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4827.1s)]
*  industrialized farming. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4832.22s)]
*  And then the total quantum of those jobs [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4833.7s)]
*  shrank by 90 percent when you had industrialized farming and tractors and whatnot. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4836.860000000001s)]
*  But the economy, to Antonio's point, grew [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4842.58s)]
*  around that business and added other kinds of businesses that didn't make sense in [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4844.780000000001s)]
*  that moment. And I think what you see is that when [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4849.34s)]
*  economies get more and more evolved, you see the growth of services, businesses [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4852.46s)]
*  that sort of are these things that can only happen when you have excess. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4857.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4862.26s)]
*  The person that you pay for closet organizing would not have had a job in the [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4862.98s)]
*  turn of the agrarian revolution or the industrial revolution. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4866.94s)]
*  But they can they can exist in 2020 something. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4870.7s)]
*  And frankly, they can make a good job. The life coach. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4872.9s)]
*  There are all these jobs that just kind of come out of nowhere. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4875.0599999999995s)]
*  Podcast or influencer, all of that. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4877.66s)]
*  Venture capitalist, capital allocator. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4880.0599999999995s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4883.82s)]
*  Mutant strawberry creator. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4885.099999999999s)]
*  So I think that I think that you're cut that waiting for this next turn of [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4887.38s)]
*  creativity, like the big problem that we all have. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4893.26s)]
*  Maybe I'll take the more glass half empty version of what Antonio said is [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4896.34s)]
*  we really haven't been unlocking people's creativity over the last 15 years. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4900.22s)]
*  We've been trending around except safe of a few companies, which we all know. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4905.38s)]
*  And we can just repeat them endlessly. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4910.42s)]
*  But we know which ones they are that are truly innovating and at the edge. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4912.14s)]
*  Everybody else is kind of diddling around naval gazing. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4916.66s)]
*  So the real problem is that we have not had a lot of reps in being created. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4920.94s)]
*  I'll give you just a very simple example, Nick. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4924.58s)]
*  Can you find this even extremely state industries? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4926.98s)]
*  Did you see the BYD clip of the car? [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4930.42s)]
*  Yes. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4933.02s)]
*  And I thought myself with a little swipe, it's tragic is it [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4934.26s)]
*  that when you look at this and you're blown away [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4939.82s)]
*  and you're blown away for two reasons. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4944.1s)]
*  One is, A, I didn't think that that was possible and B, why doesn't exist in [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4945.74s)]
*  America, but the reality underneath the hood is extremely benign how this is [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4951.74s)]
*  implemented. And so I think that the problem is we [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4957.38s)]
*  spent so much time losing the script. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4960.74s)]
*  I think Antonio is right. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4965.78s)]
*  When you unshackle people to not focus on [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4967.139999999999s)]
*  the mental load of getting the pronouns right or the this or the that. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4970.22s)]
*  You won't be so overwhelmed by things like this because you will have already been [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4975.34s)]
*  pushing the boundaries of human creativity. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4979.780000000001s)]
*  We need to get back to that. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4981.660000000001s)]
*  We need to let these creative people cook. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4982.820000000001s)]
*  And I hope that that happens. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4985.06s)]
*  I think that that will happen. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4987.54s)]
*  Freeberg, can you do a science corner on the FDA approval for the non-opioid painkiller? [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4989.22s)]
*  I not today. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4995.5s)]
*  No, I know. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4996.5s)]
*  But could you do it like in a couple of weeks? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4997.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=4999.46s)]
*  Now, the one I wanted to do is that new [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5000.94s)]
*  macro study on GLP ones, which I think is super interesting. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5004.5s)]
*  Oh, tell us. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5008.0599999999995s)]
*  You guys remember I talked a while ago about how they were able to mine VA data. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5008.94s)]
*  So the VA, right, they they take care of veterans and they have all the medical [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5013.7s)]
*  records and on an anonymized basis, they can make that data available to researchers. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5018.38s)]
*  And so if you guys remember this, this is how they identified that the Epstein [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5023.82s)]
*  bar virus or the virus that causes mono as being statistically certain to be the [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5026.9s)]
*  trigger for multiple sclerosis in the cohort of hundreds of thousands of patients [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5031.299999999999s)]
*  that were in this data set, no one. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5035.66s)]
*  Got MS that didn't get Epstein bar virus. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5040.86s)]
*  If you did not get Epstein bar virus, you did not get MS. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5043.94s)]
*  I don't know if you guys remember I did the science corner a while ago anyway. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5047.139999999999s)]
*  So the data set that you can mine at the VA is incredible. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5049.62s)]
*  So they pulled all the data from everyone [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5052.379999999999s)]
*  that's been on the GLP one agonists and they identified all of the health effects [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5054.3s)]
*  across multiple indications, the statistical difference between the cohorts. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5058.26s)]
*  OK, so this research team out of St. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5061.860000000001s)]
*  Louis pulled all the data from the VA database and basically they looked at [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5065.1s)]
*  one point two million people with diabetes that didn't take anything compared to [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5070.18s)]
*  two hundred and fifteen thousand that took the GLP one receptor agonists and [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5075.3s)]
*  another six hundred thousand people that took other drugs for diabetes. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5079.26s)]
*  So basically this cohort. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5083.62s)]
*  Segmentation allows them to isolate the effect of the GLP one drugs. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5086.62s)]
*  And as you can see here, this shows across hundreds of thousands of patients, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5092.3s)]
*  the effect of the GLP one on a hazard ratio, which means like how likely are you [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5097.1s)]
*  to have the following health condition versus the population that's not taking [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5101.7s)]
*  the GLP ones and then on the right, if you scroll to the right, Nick, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5105.94s)]
*  are the increase in risk and on the left are the things that go down. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5110.62s)]
*  So the increase, the only thing that increased is like, you know, eight percent [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5114.3s)]
*  or 10 percent increase in nausea and vomiting. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5117.58s)]
*  Yeah, can confirm musculoskeletal complications, GRD, which is gastric reflux from [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5119.9400000000005s)]
*  sleep, indigestion, yeah, and sleep disturbances, abdominal pain. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5128.02s)]
*  So it's all abdominal stuff. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5132.5s)]
*  Now, if you go over here to the benefit side, [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5133.78s)]
*  so the benefit side is what conditions did you see a decrease in? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5136.22s)]
*  So you have a decrease in shock, a decrease in hepatic failure. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5140.38s)]
*  So liver failure, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5144.820000000001s)]
*  In fact, on cardiac arrest, you see a 30 percent decrease in the probability [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5148.740000000001s)]
*  of having cardiac arrest from the cohort that's on the GLP one versus many others. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5153.1s)]
*  Belenia. Wow. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5157.9800000000005s)]
*  Schizophrenia. So so this goes to the point, if you guys remember the interview I did [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5159.9400000000005s)]
*  a couple of months ago with the CEO of Eli Lilly, that they have all these [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5164.06s)]
*  clinical trials going on right now for different indications for the GLP one [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5168.700000000001s)]
*  receptor agonists that they're seeing that there's health benefits beyond just [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5172.22s)]
*  the weight loss in reducing things like kidney disease, liver problems, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5175.9800000000005s)]
*  mental problems and so on. Do we know why? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5180.54s)]
*  And and if we don't know why, do you think it's because [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5183.5s)]
*  this is suppressing the food and it's the [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5188.580000000001s)]
*  lack of food or the change in the food consumption that's creating this? [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5190.78s)]
*  Do you know what I'm asking? [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5194.3s)]
*  Like, do you think the drug is actually? Yeah. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5195.18s)]
*  Yeah. So you should watch the interview I did with Rick's. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5197.06s)]
*  In fact, this is a good moment to call it out if you haven't seen it. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5200.66s)]
*  It's actually I think he highlights that this class of drugs, there are genes get [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5203.18s)]
*  turned on and off, so there's a what's called a gene expression cascade that [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5208.38s)]
*  occurs with certain compounds. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5213.06s)]
*  So we know that the GLP one receptor [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5215.58s)]
*  agonist means that it binds to these GLP one sites and there's a cascading effect [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5218.18s)]
*  of genes that then get expressed. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5222.42s)]
*  And what that seems to do is turn off things like inflammatory markers. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5224.54s)]
*  It turns on things like search genes, which can actually increase cellular repair. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5228.700000000001s)]
*  So there seem to be other benefits from these drugs beyond just the appetite [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5233.26s)]
*  control, and it's not the appetite control itself. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5236.700000000001s)]
*  But there seems to be other effects. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5239.46s)]
*  Let me ask you a question from these these receptors being activated. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5240.860000000001s)]
*  Would you put your kids on this? [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5244.06s)]
*  No. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5247.139999999999s)]
*  OK, would you put your wife on this? [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5248.219999999999s)]
*  I would consider it and I would consider it for myself, too, just for the anti [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5251.379999999999s)]
*  inflammatory effects. How will you make that decision? [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5255.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, for me personally, and the thing that I weigh against is the muscle loss [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5258.099999999999s)]
*  and the bone density loss. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5262.0599999999995s)]
*  So I think that if you look at the biggest kind of effect on these on the [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5264.58s)]
*  downside basis is you should increase your protein in your diet. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5268.179999999999s)]
*  You have to do weightlifting. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5271.86s)]
*  There's things that you would do. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5273.58s)]
*  And frankly, if you do those things anyway, [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5274.62s)]
*  if you increase protein in your diet and do more weightlifting, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5276.54s)]
*  you're actually going to see very good health benefits from just doing those [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5279.5s)]
*  things that may actually outweigh the benefits you get from the GOP. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5282.38s)]
*  I have a question for you, which is the question is when you look at that data [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5285.86s)]
*  and you talk to the CEOs, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5289.38s)]
*  how much do you think really long term and the long term says are out is going to be [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5291.94s)]
*  that it was the drug or just being obese is very bad for you. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5295.26s)]
*  And so when you take your body fat down [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5299.18s)]
*  dramatically, all these other gene expressions happen anyway. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5301.5s)]
*  Right. So you think which one will this is? [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5304.22s)]
*  This is what they're starting to isolate. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5306.26s)]
*  And I will say, Antonio, they are starting to see that there are other [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5308.06s)]
*  expressions that are not related to the obesity and people that don't have [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5312.38s)]
*  obesity that they're using that are using these drugs. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5315.58s)]
*  So they're seeing that cohort data now. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5317.820000000001s)]
*  Clinical studies, phase two were published. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5319.900000000001s)]
*  And I think we're going to see phase three and some of these indications soon. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5322.26s)]
*  But it is looking very positive that it's not just the loss of obesity. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5325.74s)]
*  Now, to your point, being obese, not exercising, eating poorly, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5329.860000000001s)]
*  destroys your health. You stop that. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5334.22s)]
*  Right. Right. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5336.18s)]
*  Everything gets better if you lift weights. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5337.26s)]
*  Freebrook, can you tell us when you decide to do this? [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5339.780000000001s)]
*  I will. Yeah. If I if I do do a GLP one receptor agonist, I will let you guys know [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5342.34s)]
*  right now, I actually feel like I want to go through a process of increasing [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5347.18s)]
*  my weightlifting routine more. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5352.9800000000005s)]
*  I've been trying to create a more kind of rigorous schedule. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5354.54s)]
*  My schedule just sucks. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5357.860000000001s)]
*  So that's been the hardest thing for me. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5358.740000000001s)]
*  But I actually want to go through that first before making that decision. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5360.14s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of cool, David. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5363.5s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5364.74s)]
*  No, I was just curious. Why why that order? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5365.78s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5367.74s)]
*  I want to measure the effects because I do think that if you actually get into a [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5368.46s)]
*  regular weightlifting routine and you increase protein in your diet, which is [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5372.42s)]
*  another thing I've been making a concerted measured effort to do, [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5376.18s)]
*  which is hard as a vegetarian, by the way. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5380.66s)]
*  You see pretty significant health effects. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5383.900000000001s)]
*  And so I'm trying to get through the process of increasing muscle composition [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5386.58s)]
*  before I make the decision on whether or not to add GLP one. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5390.58s)]
*  I don't want to kind of confound the two factors. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5392.74s)]
*  You know, and I did that made it super easy for me is I got egg whites in a [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5394.7s)]
*  carton and I have this incredible crunchy, spicy garlic thing that everybody [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5399.78s)]
*  mumufuku and everybody makes and everybody's crazy about. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5407.82s)]
*  Just in the mornings, I'll eat whatever it is. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5410.5s)]
*  Ten ounces, 12 ounces of egg whites with that spicy stuff. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5413.38s)]
*  It's delicious. It's awesome. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5416.9s)]
*  And I just try to, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5418.34s)]
*  you know, get that whatever 30, 40 grams of protein first thing in the morning [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5420.099999999999s)]
*  and then doing the rocking. Well, this is is easy. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5424.219999999999s)]
*  You just wear a 35 pound weight vest, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5427.62s)]
*  freeberg and you walk a mile or two and you will get my problem. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5429.9s)]
*  Jason, with all of this is that every time I see something. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5434.299999999999s)]
*  So I saw Gary Brekka on the Sean Ryan podcast recently and Sean Ryan asks him, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5437.66s)]
*  like, what are a handful of things that you recommend for everybody? [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5443.62s)]
*  Right. And he recommends mineral salt. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5446.82s)]
*  And then he recommends a methylated vitamin. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5449.02s)]
*  He recommends amino acids, whatever. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5451.26s)]
*  There's a protocol. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5453.18s)]
*  Then if you happen to catch a clip on exit, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5454.660000000001s)]
*  Andrew Huberman, he'll have a protocol. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5456.700000000001s)]
*  And then Brian Johnson has a protocol. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5458.740000000001s)]
*  And the problem is all these protocols [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5461.38s)]
*  are slightly the same, but they're just different enough where it creates [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5463.700000000001s)]
*  a huge cognitive load in a normal person like myself to your point, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5467.18s)]
*  Freeberg, who's busy, who's got a job, who's got kids. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5470.42s)]
*  How do you decide? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5474.34s)]
*  And so I would really love something to be sort of like, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5475.3s)]
*  I don't want to say gold standard because you can't say that, but. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5480.1s)]
*  That is like, what's the real bang for your buck? [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5483.9400000000005s)]
*  What Antonio said, you know, are you just better off just losing the 50 pounds and [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5486.7s)]
*  then this is why these products are successful and I think will be continue [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5490.42s)]
*  to grow pretty dramatically, Antonio, is because it is pop a pill and it solves [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5495.34s)]
*  all those problems. It doesn't require cognitive load. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5499.46s)]
*  And it will be in a pill format soon. Right. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5502.06s)]
*  I mean, the pills are almost here. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5504.1s)]
*  I love you. Very cool, actually, if you do this, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5506.34s)]
*  to Jamal's point about, you know, people being confused. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5508.780000000001s)]
*  If you did the every every person's kind of story around this journey and you [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5512.1s)]
*  document it, you know, like you did, you did like this is my weight. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5518.26s)]
*  I did weightlifting first. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5520.860000000001s)]
*  Then I did the GOP one. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5521.900000000001s)]
*  And you actually did like a weekly thing where you checked in and even it was 10 [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5522.780000000001s)]
*  minutes up on X or something where you just gave people the journey [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5526.26s)]
*  in a way that wasn't so complicated because I think people are confused. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5531.06s)]
*  Jamal's right. I have five very good doctors. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5533.98s)]
*  You guys have good doctors. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5535.62s)]
*  But if you don't, you don't know what to do. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5536.54s)]
*  By the way, the problem for me, just to give you a sense of it, [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5538.82s)]
*  I had a doctor in L.A., I had a doctor in San Francisco. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5541.54s)]
*  I would have them do their own versions of things. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5545.54s)]
*  Then I would have somebody else help me compare. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5547.78s)]
*  It cost me way too much money. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5550.94s)]
*  And all that complexity did was make the quality of my health care actually go down. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5552.62s)]
*  And instead, what I really wanted was just a very simple protocol that said. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5557.379999999999s)]
*  Take the metformin because it's good for you. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5561.98s)]
*  Take the vitamin D, take the omega 3 fatty acids. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5564.0599999999995s)]
*  Otherwise, just eat this meal plan. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5566.9s)]
*  And it would help me a lot more than than I've had to cobble it together myself. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5568.66s)]
*  Because, by the way, when you see something like, you know, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5573.179999999999s)]
*  Gary Brekka is very, very articulate, very smart. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5575.179999999999s)]
*  But when I see him on the Sean Ryan podcast, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5578.46s)]
*  the first thing I do is I go and populate an Amazon cart with all the things that [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5580.7s)]
*  he said, because my instinct is, well, I should do the right thing for myself. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5584.299999999999s)]
*  This is a couple hundred bucks. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5588.259999999999s)]
*  It's worth the investment. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5589.299999999999s)]
*  But then the day after somebody else has something else. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5591.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, so I'll be really interested. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5594.86s)]
*  You have a little OCD, though, Chamath. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5596.219999999999s)]
*  I've known you for a long time. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5597.38s)]
*  You get very obsessive with these things. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5598.82s)]
*  Well, my father died because of poor health. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5601.219999999999s)]
*  My best friend died of poor health. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5602.7s)]
*  I feel like. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5604.339999999999s)]
*  You should at least do the things that are preventable. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5606.139999999999s)]
*  Have you guys seen that post Chamath did with he was like half naked in the mirror? [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5609.38s)]
*  He looks great. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5613.179999999999s)]
*  What are you talking about? He looks great. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5614.38s)]
*  If you could look like that, you'd do it too. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5616.259999999999s)]
*  No, no, no. I'm talking about like when [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5618.5s)]
*  you had the glucose monitor, I'm sitting with him at the poker table. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5620.099999999999s)]
*  He's got the glucose monitor and he's taking a sip of wine. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5623.0199999999995s)]
*  He's checking the glucose. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5625.94s)]
*  He's having like a piece of Bejewed. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5627.82s)]
*  Then he's checking the glucose monitor. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5629.62s)]
*  It's just like literally becomes obsessive. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5631.9s)]
*  Then with the. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5634.459999999999s)]
*  Oh, there he is. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5635.98s)]
*  Come on. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5637.339999999999s)]
*  I don't know if this AI stuff is. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5638.74s)]
*  You know what's so funny about this picture? [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5640.86s)]
*  All these clowns. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5642.54s)]
*  All these clowns on the Internet are like, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5644.379999999999s)]
*  they don't understand that when you're six foot two, these are big legs. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5646.299999999999s)]
*  When you're six foot two. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5650.099999999999s)]
*  When you're a short king. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5651.459999999999s)]
*  I'm the captain now. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5656.0199999999995s)]
*  When you're like five, seven, five, eight. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5657.74s)]
*  I get it. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5662.7s)]
*  Why you guys? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5663.339999999999s)]
*  Because you guys are all stubby and short. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5663.98s)]
*  I don't get it. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5665.459999999999s)]
*  This is the problem with generative AI. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5665.98s)]
*  You can tell it's a fake photo. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5667.58s)]
*  You can tell that that was generative AI because nobody has legs that day. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5669.299999999999s)]
*  How could you have biceps and then legs that don't make sense? [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3q5TrwSek0&t=5673.219999999999s)]
