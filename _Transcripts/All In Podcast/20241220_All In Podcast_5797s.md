*  Don't know what's going on. We've been trying to figure out where he is. He's MIA [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=317.5s)]
*  If anybody knows in DC this week. Yeah. Oh, is that what's going on? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=321.62s)]
*  all the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=325.94s)]
*  Meetings, I know I'm being facetious. He's he's he's in meetings [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=327.18s)]
*  Mr. Sax went to Washington creating waves, but mr. Sax is in Washington and have you guys seen the photos? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=332.66s)]
*  Aaron, what do you think of what do you think of sex in this role? I [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=340.42s)]
*  Think it's uh, I think he's a strong pick [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=345.3s)]
*  Let the genuflecting begin [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=350.86s)]
*  So crypto I'm a little bit indifferent on you know, I I haven't you know [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=354.5s)]
*  Sort of we haven't spent much time there leaned in much but there but but on AI I [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=360.56s)]
*  think is a very very strong pick and [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=366.0s)]
*  I think you want somebody that is [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=368.8s)]
*  You know has a general sort of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=372.76s)]
*  deregulation anti-regulation bent at this stage in the evolution of the technology [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=376.8s)]
*  I think there's risk of of sort of slowing down too much progress right now [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=381.3s)]
*  And I think that I think he'll provide, you know some good [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=386.28s)]
*  Kind of parameters and principles around around how to avoid that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=390.08s)]
*  So I think very strong and then you know crypto again [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=392.97999999999996s)]
*  Don't know don't know too much about and then we'll see the rest of the topics as a software CEO [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=395.32s)]
*  Yeah of a public company when the Biden administration was putting forward their proposals on [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=399.47999999999996s)]
*  How to regulate AI and have definitions on the size of a model and what the models could or shouldn't do and the regulatory [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=406.32s)]
*  Authority they would have over the software that's written. What was your reaction and you were supporting Harris at the time? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=413.12s)]
*  I believe or Biden at the time, right? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=418.94s)]
*  But like how did you react to that when you saw those proposals and just to be clear? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=421.24s)]
*  Are you talking about the EO that went out? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=425.36s)]
*  Yeah, there was the EO, but then they were also drafting [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=428.2s)]
*  They published a lot of detailed drafting and then obviously California had its bill which you probably saw as well [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=431.1s)]
*  Which specified like the number of parameters in a model the size of a model and yeah [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=436.16s)]
*  In reverse order was was against SB 1047 [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=441.74s)]
*  It felt like you know, you had two big issues one [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=446.86s)]
*  You probably don't want state-by-state legislation on this topic that that's gonna be you're in a world for of hurt [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=449.42s)]
*  If if every state has a different approach to this and then second [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=454.38s)]
*  secondarily if you just look at how it evolved from the very first proposal to the final proposal and [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=457.82s)]
*  Unfortunately the kind of underlying philosophy that was in the the bill [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=463.94s)]
*  It was it was very clearly a sort of like like viewing, you know [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=467.26s)]
*  basically AI progress as inherently risky right now and [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=471.88s)]
*  So it just ratcheted up the the different, you know levels of consequence [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=475.38s)]
*  for the AI model developers and and the risk is is sort of the second or third order effects of that which is like [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=479.97999999999996s)]
*  Does Zuck then want to release the next version of llama if you're taking on you know that much risk and and you know [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=486.58s)]
*  even the incremental updates the liability you have [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=492.58s)]
*  Yeah in terms of any of the model advancements [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=496.32s)]
*  and so right now we're benefiting from just an incredibly competitive market between five or six players and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=499.28s)]
*  You want them running as fast as possible not having to have sort of this, you know a whole council [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=504.84s)]
*  Before every model gets released because they're they're you know in fear of getting sued by you know [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=510.44s)]
*  The government for hundreds of millions of dollars if one person does something wrong with the model [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=514.74s)]
*  So that was the problem with SB 1047. That's been the problem with some of the the proposals on national legislation [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=518.84s)]
*  I felt like the first CEO it didn't have a lot of teeth in it [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=523.48s)]
*  So so it kind of was more like let's watch, you know this space and continue to study it [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=526.84s)]
*  The actual current head of S OSTP Artie probable car a lot of folks in Silicon Valley know her [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=531.5200000000001s)]
*  She's actually very strong very technical [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=536.84s)]
*  You know understands the valley well is not a sort of does not lean into over regulation [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=539.2800000000001s)]
*  So I actually think OSTP has had a pretty good steward even under Biden [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=544.6400000000001s)]
*  But but I think you know the efforts that that Saks would you know clearly be leading I think would lean even more toward AI progress [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=550.4000000000001s)]
*  and and sort of not [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=556.6800000000001s)]
*  Accidentally over regulating too early and not in this journey [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=559.44s)]
*  So, let me ask you a question then about crypto you're not into crypto [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=564.2800000000001s)]
*  Crypto is a little bit harder to regulate. So with Saks being there [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=569.0s)]
*  What do we think the one two or three things he could do to actually make crypto? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=572.8800000000001s)]
*  Not a scam not have consumers get left holding the bag [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=579.48s)]
*  obviously [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=584.8000000000001s)]
*  Sandboxing projects maybe having people know your customer, you know some basic regulation there are the sophisticated [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=586.44s)]
*  Investor test comes to mind. What do you think Saks should do in terms of crypto regulation in the short term in the near term? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=593.6s)]
*  That's a really good question. I think that [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=601.1600000000001s)]
*  today there are a lot of [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  Really valuable use cases that can sit on top of [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=607.76s)]
*  Crypto rails, I think the most obvious one is [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=613.04s)]
*  How you can have real-time payments using stable coins? I think the United States government is already using [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=616.68s)]
*  some of these stable coins for a bunch of purposes [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=623.76s)]
*  The number of companies that are beginning to adopt and use stable coins is actually growing very take a second to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=627.0s)]
*  Find stable coins for the audience just to catch people up. Let me define what a stable coin is, which is that you put a [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=633.64s)]
*  Dollar into a wallet somewhere and in return you get a digital token of that dollar [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=641.5600000000001s)]
*  there are two big purveyors of [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=648.6800000000001s)]
*  Stable coins, there's tether and then there's USDC, which is this company called Circle. I [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=651.84s)]
*  Think the easiest way to disambiguate them is tether is abroad [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=657.32s)]
*  I think it's run out of somewhere in the Caribbean and [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=662.32s)]
*  USDC is American it's run by this company called Circle. The other difference is that there is some ambiguity [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=666.6400000000001s)]
*  Around how these assets are secured [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=674.88s)]
*  So what a stable coin is supposed to do is when you give them a dollar they're supposed to go and buy [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=678.44s)]
*  Some short-term treasury security so that that dollar is always guaranteed [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=683.48s)]
*  Because if you had a billion dollars of stable coins, but only [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=688.56s)]
*  900 million dollars of assets to back them up. There's an insolvency risk there. There's a run-on-the-bank risk [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=694.1999999999999s)]
*  So theoretically a billion dollars of stable coins should have a billion dollars of cash in some short-term fungible security [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=700.3599999999999s)]
*  What's incredible is at the scale in which these stable coins operate that has turned out to be an enormous business [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=707.7199999999999s)]
*  Why when you give them a billion dollars and get a billion dollars of stable coins in return [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=714.9599999999999s)]
*  They just go and put it into the bank and you know when interest rates are two three four five percent [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=719.6199999999999s)]
*  They're making billions and billions of dollars. They get the float they get the float [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=724.7199999999999s)]
*  So these businesses have turned out to be incredible, but that's beyond the point [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=730.4399999999999s)]
*  The point is that a lot of companies that you would never think so, for example, SpaceX uses these stable coins [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=734.1999999999999s)]
*  How how do you think they collect payments from all the Starlink customers when they aggregate them in all of these longtail countries? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=740.12s)]
*  They don't want to necessarily take the FX risk the foreign exchange risk. They don't want to deal with sending wires [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=747.4000000000001s)]
*  So what they do is they'll swap into stable coin send it back to the United States and then swap back to US dollars [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=753.32s)]
*  So it's a very useful utility. So [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=758.76s)]
*  Number one is I think we need to make those rails [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=762.0400000000001s)]
*  The standard rails in the United States and what that does is it allows us to chip away at all of this decrepit [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=766.36s)]
*  Infrastructure that the banks use to sort of slow down and tax a process that should never have been taxed [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=774.48s)]
*  Good competition in a way Chamoff. It's incredible now the banks have somebody to [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=781.56s)]
*  Challenge them for money transfer and money storage and it could be regulated and stable, but I guess so that should it [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=787.28s)]
*  Yeah, but that's that's the first thing but then the second thing it allows you to do is you start you can see a world [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=793.68s)]
*  Where now you can have real competition against the traditional rails? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=798.68s)]
*  Specifically Visa MasterCard American Express because when you look at great companies like stripe I use stripe I pay them 3% [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=802.64s)]
*  if I use stable coins from stripe I [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=811.4799999999999s)]
*  I don't pay zero, but I don't pay 3% [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=815.0s)]
*  It's kind of somewhere in the middle if I was technically adept at implementing [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=817.3599999999999s)]
*  Stable coins through the entire stack of my product [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=821.6800000000001s)]
*  So I use it for this learn with me thing where we publish research. I would save a lot of money [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=825.6400000000001s)]
*  So yes, the idea that you can take that 300 basis points you pay to these companies and crush it to zero [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=831.1600000000001s)]
*  Would be a boon [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=838.2800000000001s)]
*  to global GDP because that's 3% on [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=840.48s)]
*  Many tens of trillions of dollars Aaron you're shaking your head [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=844.2s)]
*  This is a something that you're experimenting with at box or you're aware of or a problem that you recognize [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=847.56s)]
*  No, no, just that I mean the credit card rails is I mean the tax on [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=853.7399999999999s)]
*  On transactions is obviously insane [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=857.4399999999999s)]
*  So so the stable coin being the intermediary for that in the future makes total sense if you could get everybody kind of coordinate [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=859.3599999999999s)]
*  Against that. So yeah [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=866.28s)]
*  Well in regulating it would get people off of tether hopefully which has a checkered colorful sorted pass [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=868.28s)]
*  You can go look it up, but they've had many many legal but I think again, I think it looks like [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=874.08s)]
*  Yeah, but in fairness to them, I think again both of these two companies look as of today [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=880.5600000000001s)]
*  Again, you have a jurisdictional issue difference, but as of today, it looks like they're both pegged one for one [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=885.9200000000001s)]
*  but anyways, the point is if Sachs can really push the adoption of stable coins number one and then number two is to [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=891.9200000000001s)]
*  incentivize [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=900.5200000000001s)]
*  Much much cheaper transactional rails, then I think he can go to Bitcoin and [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=902.12s)]
*  These other more long tail crypto projects off of the back of momentum because these first two things [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=908.5600000000001s)]
*  I think everybody will embrace and he won't get caught in a political quagmire [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=914.84s)]
*  these other things you have these opponents always coming into the system and they have even Bitcoin like [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=919.24s)]
*  when I said this thing about [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=925.88s)]
*  Encryption and quantum and even though I I thought I was very clear the crypto [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=928.24s)]
*  Community on the internet went absolutely crazy all last [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=935.16s)]
*  Yeah, but the thing is like some of the maxis piled on then when they actually took time to understand the technicalities of what? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=939.28s)]
*  I was saying other people realized that was right that they were tweeting it. My point is [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=945.08s)]
*  That world is so religious [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=949.8s)]
*  Animated and energized that I think it's hard to use them as the first place where you find progress [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=952.5999999999999s)]
*  So I would tell sacks on it go to stable coins then disrupt the visa rails and then go to the other stuff [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=959.92s)]
*  I would go stable coins and I would go even before that the accreditation test that I've been talking about because the SEC has that [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=965.56s)]
*  Mandate people were educated Aaron [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=972.16s)]
*  They could buy crypto and know they're gonna lose their money or know that something so fugazi or fugazi [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=974.1999999999999s)]
*  Whatever it is [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=979.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I I'm sure we want to move on but I guess that so there's a there's a parallel universe where where [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=982.0799999999999s)]
*  So no matter what like obviously Gensler did not get his arms around this whole thing. So so that was a big big mistake [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=990.04s)]
*  but there's sort of like like [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=996.92s)]
*  DeFi slash financial crypto where where almost everything is is deflationary it improves the rails [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=999.92s)]
*  You know if you believe in Bitcoin as this, you know store value [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1007.48s)]
*  and digital gold like all of those things can actually kind of make sense and be a bit rational and like improve things and then [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1012.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, you know, unfortunately or not depending on your views. There was this other sort of you know [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1017.62s)]
*  Fractal event that happened which was oh, let's also use these things as a means of of [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1023.5999999999999s)]
*  kind of creating a virtual, you know currency and and and token equities and and tokens for anything [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1029.18s)]
*  Where that then runs into? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1036.44s)]
*  Basically the SEC remit of like are these things securities or not? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1039.2s)]
*  And is there insider trading or not and can anybody issue them at any time and promote them on Twitter or not? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1042.3600000000001s)]
*  And so so, you know, I think to some extent if you could get back to like crypto 1.0 [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1047.3600000000001s)]
*  Which was like this is a this is a financial infrastructure [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1052.04s)]
*  I think you would have avoided a lot of the the sort of noise and challenges with with crypto now [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1055.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't know you can't put the you can't put it back in the bag [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1060.22s)]
*  But but there's like I don't think you could get ten crypto people to agree on how you regulate that second category [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1062.92s)]
*  because some people some people believe I should be able to issue an NFT on anything and I should be able to trade that and [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1068.8799999999999s)]
*  and and at the same time they would obviously they would sort of claim well, that's just the same as a as an aftermarket [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1075.4s)]
*  you know seat to a concert and [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1081.28s)]

*  All right, let's doge is fully operational [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1122.04s)]
*  Elon and the vague have helped kill the last-minute omnibus spending bill [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1125.32s)]
*  Wednesday night the bill had been killed and [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1130.48s)]
*  We were looking at the government shutting down starting Friday, December 20th today when you were listening to this [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1134.6000000000001s)]
*  For some quick background in September Congress approved a bill that would keep the government funded through December 20th [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1141.6000000000001s)]

*  Three days before the deadline leaders in Congress unveiled what was presented as a bipartisan stopgap bill [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1154.84s)]
*  That would keep the government funded through March 14 that kind of bill is called a continuing resolution [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1161.08s)]
*  Basically give you more time for the incoming GOP majority to reach an agreement on the funding for the government [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1167.1200000000001s)]
*  There are two major problems with the bill it's a rush job [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1174.04s)]
*  It had to pass the house in the Senate by Friday night after being presented on Tuesday. It's absurdly long [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1176.52s)]
*  1500 pages with [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1183.48s)]
*  340 billion dollars in spending including pay raises and better health care benefits for the members of Congress [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1185.56s)]

*  Money being thrown everywhere a billion three to replace the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1208.28s)]
*  They had some spicy comments on it. Congress has known about the deadline since they created it in late September [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1213.6799999999998s)]
*  He said the urgency is a hundred percent manufactured designed to avoid serious public debate [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1219.56s)]
*  But serious public debate is exactly what's happening on Twitter. People are screenshotting and using [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1224.82s)]
*  chat GPT and Claude and and Gemini to [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1230.6799999999998s)]
*  work their way through these documents and [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1234.72s)]
*  It looks like this is not going to happen freeburg your thoughts [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1237.72s)]
*  So the proposed bill made no real change to the current spending level of the federal government at roughly [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1241.28s)]
*  6.2 trillion dollars on an annualized basis, which by the way is roughly call it [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1248.2s)]
*  23 percent of GDP just to give you some context in [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1254.6399999999999s)]
*  1860 nearly a hundred years after the founding of the United States government [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1259.6000000000001s)]
*  federal spending to GDP was less than 1% and [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1264.88s)]
*  It took off during the Civil War for a couple of years [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1269.0800000000002s)]
*  But you know, we're at these kind of like unprecedented levels year after year now [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1273.1200000000001s)]
*  Really speaking to how the federal government has grown as we talked about many times so much in our life [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1277.92s)]
*  And you know at some roads were really bad back then though [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1283.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah our roads were really bad back then but [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1287.2s)]
*  But remember the objective of the Republic was to have the states make local decisions about how to take care of their infrastructure [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1291.16s)]
*  the National Highway [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1298.72s)]
*  Effort obviously changed that in the the mid 20th century [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1301.0800000000002s)]
*  But this was kind of the original intention of the Republic. It wasn't to have the federal government come in and employ people [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1304.72s)]
*  provide [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1311.3600000000001s)]
*  Insurance to people provide energy markets to people own football stadiums [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1312.8s)]
*  Etc, etc, etc. You go through the list of things in this bill [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1318.84s)]
*  I think the hundred billion dollars of natural death disaster relief everyone says that seems very reasonable [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1321.76s)]
*  That's something the federal government should do when we have a natural disaster. We need help. We need support [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1327.44s)]
*  That's a great thing for the federal government to do but think about the incentive it creates it distorts markets [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1331.84s)]
*  So we've talked about this in the past in areas where you have a higher probability of natural disasters and people have paid a lot [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1337.48s)]
*  Of money for their homes pay a lot of money for infrastructure [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1344.1200000000001s)]
*  should the federal government come in and [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1346.92s)]
*  Rebuild those homes and provide capital to those individuals and those businesses [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1349.1200000000001s)]
*  To help them rebuild those homes if there's a high probability of natural disaster events happening again in the future [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1352.76s)]
*  it means that the cost of insurance doesn't matter and the cost of real estate doesn't matter because the federal government effectively can come in and [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1358.08s)]
*  Support those prices in the same way the federal comes in government comes in and supports the prices in agricultural products [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1365.2s)]
*  Through the work in the farm bill and through the biofuels mandates, which were also proposed to be extended in this thing [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1370.92s)]
*  so the federal government's playing both a market role and [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1376.3600000000001s)]
*  You know also kind of this role that I think fills the gap [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1380.0s)]
*  Where people want to have a customer where there isn't a customer and an employee or where there isn't one? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1383.3200000000002s)]
*  So like how did we get to this point? So refers principles perspective [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1388.48s)]
*  We've kind of I think lost the narrative on what the federal government was meant to do [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1392.44s)]
*  If you think about the simple rubric in a bill like just go back some period of time and someone says hey [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1396.0400000000002s)]
*  I want something I want to have this in this bill and you're the representative that's supposed to vote on that bill and say [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1401.24s)]
*  Yes, or no, it's very hard to just say no. We are not going to spend that money. What's the incentive to say no? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1406.88s)]
*  The alternative is you say yes, but give me X as well [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1414.76s)]
*  There is an incentive in that response and the incentive there is to get something for your electorate the people that voted you in as [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1419.68s)]
*  a representative of the house [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1426.84s)]
*  which is how we ended up at this point where everyone says I want something if you're gonna get something and [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1428.44s)]
*  Eventually the government the federal government swells to spending roughly 24% of our GDP now the biggest mistake [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1433.96s)]
*  I think the founding fathers made was that they didn't create [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1441.24s)]
*  Constitutional limits on spending and enrichment and this was because they had these deeply held philosophical beliefs that relied on the House of Representatives [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1443.9199999999998s)]
*  to provide a check [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1451.36s)]
*  By the people if you read the Federalist papers and I went through a couple of these recently and I use chat GPT to help [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1453.12s)]
*  me kind of [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1459.28s)]
*  You know bring out some of I think the key points but in the Federalist papers 10 and 51 [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1460.12s)]
*  James Madison emphasized that the structure of government was meant to ensure that both state and federal governments would limit each other's excesses [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1466.12s)]
*  Including their financial ones and then in the Federalist paper number 58 [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1473.24s)]
*  He said the House of Representatives has control over the quote power of the purse which gives the people's representatives authority [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1477.2s)]
*  over taxation and spending but they also warned along with Alexander Hamilton of [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1484.4s)]
*  the dangers of unchecked government power [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1490.4s)]
*  Through burdensome taxation and excess spending which would ultimately erode individual freedoms [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1492.8400000000001s)]
*  So they recognized that there were going to be limits but their expectation was that the house and the individuals that were electing people [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1498.96s)]
*  to the house that were members of this Republic would come in and say we're gonna keep that from happening and [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1504.96s)]
*  Clearly something went wrong along the way that we got to this point where again spending is 24% of GDP [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1510.24s)]
*  And I think that the biggest thing they got wrong was that they didn't create these [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1516.56s)]
*  Constitutional limits on federal spending or taxation through either a balanced budget [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1520.84s)]
*  Structure spending as a percentage GDP no federal debt or term limits or all of these other mechanisms that could have been introduced at the beginning [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1525.76s)]
*  That could have created some structural limits instead [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1533.0400000000002s)]
*  They assumed that there was this natural limit that would emerge as a function of the democratic process because of how they formed the government [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1536.8000000000002s)]
*  But unfortunately, I think they failed to realize [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1543.2s)]
*  That the electorate who would eventually not want the freedoms of the people of the time [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1546.3600000000001s)]
*  Back then in [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1553.5200000000002s)]
*  1776 this was a pioneering country where everyone wanted to come here to have freedom to do anything they wanted [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1555.5200000000002s)]
*  Everywhere they wanted to build a business to homestead to be rugged individuals. It was entrepreneurial [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1562.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was and over the last 250 years [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1567.96s)]
*  we've gotten used to an increment in lifestyle every year and [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1571.4s)]
*  discovered that we have a mechanism to force the increment in lifestyle through the actions of government and so the electorate has stood up and said [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1575.0800000000002s)]
*  I want more each year and I want the government to provide it for me if the free markets are not doing it [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1582.92s)]
*  And that's really where we kind of got to this point where I think we elected people to the house [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1588.0400000000002s)]
*  Who ultimately had this incentive that said if I give you this I need to get this and we ended up swelling this [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1592.2800000000002s)]
*  So I don't know if it cracks with Doge [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1597.7800000000002s)]
*  I really don't know if people step up and recognize the limits of [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1600.0400000000002s)]
*  Of government and what the limits should be if the federal government on an electorate basis [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1603.72s)]
*  It's an amazing moment to see that Elon went on Twitter and said hey guys, this is nuts and everyone said this is nuts [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1608.26s)]
*  We're not gonna elect you if you do this if that momentum and that transparency can keep up [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1613.3s)]
*  I hope that people start to connect the dots if this isn't a free lunch that the federal government spending is not limitless [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1617.78s)]
*  And it's not unaccountable Aaron. I think we have enough people [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1624.1s)]
*  Who are notable now? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1629.22s)]
*  speaking up about this excess spending and [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1631.22s)]
*  The out-of-control debt that it's now in vogue to talk about austerity to talk about inefficiency [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1634.58s)]
*  And that really all comes back to doge and dare. I say, you know the conversations [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1642.14s)]
*  We've been having this podcast for two years that this is becoming acute [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1647.74s)]
*  What are your thoughts on this vibe shift this complete pivot where we've gone from my lord? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1650.3400000000001s)]
*  Everybody's saying I got to get mine. You got yours. I'm getting mine to [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1656.54s)]
*  Name and shame they're naming and shaming now [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1660.86s)]
*  very specific pieces of pork in these bills, you know including [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1664.74s)]
*  stadiums for and the NFL and people are like [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1669.62s)]
*  Why is the NFL getting this if there were 20 30 40 billion dollars to just quick thoughts one Patrick Olson had a tweet yesterday [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1671.86s)]
*  That basically said this sort of this the this big misinformation [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1679.1799999999998s)]
*  Kind of created by by people that want to be slow is that you you have to sort of choose two of fast good and cheap [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1683.54s)]
*  And I think basically, you know Elan's companies have sort of always [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1690.86s)]
*  Effectively kind of proven the opposite which is which is actually if you just like start to ask the question [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1695.8999999999999s)]
*  Like why does that thing have to cost as much? [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1701.3s)]
*  You know if you're building a rocket or designing a car or developing batteries like what why you know [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1704.06s)]
*  If you just do ground up, why does that the cost as much? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1709.1799999999998s)]
*  And so so it's interesting is is that that probably if most people looked at what the government was spending on they wouldn't even feel like [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1711.02s)]
*  Like you know, it's not even helping them in like the disaster relief sense of [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1717.6999999999998s)]
*  You know, I think like that either probably actually people that actually do experience the benefits of disaster relief [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1722.3s)]
*  It's actually just all of the all of the overhead that we've created to getting anything done in the government that could actually make the government [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1727.78s)]
*  better serve that all of the constituents I was talking to [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1734.78s)]
*  You know sort of a nameless individual in the government the other the other week where by Congress they have to hire [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1738.58s)]
*  Contractors to do work and the contractors the contracting firms charge them two and a half times [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1746.06s)]
*  the the sort of cost of of an individual employee that they could otherwise hire and so and so now now they have to outsource the [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1751.3s)]
*  Work and they don't have any accountability mechanism for that contractor [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1758.54s)]
*  And so I think there's not a single American that could look at that and say and say this is like actually working well [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1762.8s)]
*  like yeah, we are spending more money to do less and [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1768.36s)]
*  The ultimate outcome is actually lower quality [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1772.6999999999998s)]
*  and so so you have to at some point just kind of do a little bit of a reset moment and that's obviously the [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1775.9399999999998s)]
*  the upside of Doge is like it's like it breaks every rule of us thinking about how [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1781.4399999999998s)]
*  how you would actually go and attack this problem we thought you'd attack it through meetings and [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1785.84s)]
*  And we would do it through through congressional, you know sort of processes and research and it's actually just it is, you know [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1790.1s)]
*  obviously a much more sort of [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1797.0s)]
*  Founder startup oriented way to approach this there's gonna be lots of things that are broken glass around the edges [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1799.24s)]
*  There's no question, but I think what's interesting about this week's event is I think that there's been this underlying kind of notion of like [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1804.88s)]
*  You know Elon and and whatnot at all [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1811.52s)]
*  You know don't understand the government enough to be able to change it and it might actually be the case that the government doesn't understand [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1814.44s)]
*  Elon in the sense of of like he will just see this thing through and [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1821.28s)]
*  The tools at his disposal and doge's disposal is is sort of you know [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1826.24s)]
*  completely unprecedented in terms of the ability to put any anybody in Congress on notice if [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1830.5s)]
*  You know if basically they are promoting things that are not making the country better [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1836.0400000000002s)]
*  So so that the you know the thing that we saw this week was actually that playing out everybody's been wondering [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1840.2800000000002s)]
*  Well, what are the actual you know? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1845.5600000000002s)]
*  What are the formal mechanisms doge has to accomplish and enact change and it's like you just saw it like they can just [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1847.24s)]
*  They can just create enough visibility and spotlight on the problem that it causes it a level of discomfort in in [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1853.48s)]
*  Supporting moving forward with with whatever that thing is and so I think it's interesting [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1861.44s)]
*  I have no opinion on the actual elements of the bill other than from a [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1865.1200000000001s)]
*  Process standpoint and a and a new kind of case study of how this is gonna play out is I think we're seeing some early [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1869.28s)]
*  Indication of what doge will will be able to do Aaron. How do you feel about this doge effort? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1875.64s)]
*  As someone who is a public Harris supporter, so you've come out. I think you've you've been public about this [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1882.0s)]
*  I want to understand like why people [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1887.76s)]
*  Wouldn't be supportive of this effort right like like what is like? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1891.2s)]
*  What is the motivation for people saying this isn't a good thing? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1894.88s)]
*  We shouldn't be doing this because there's a lot of folks that have gone on these shows [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1897.88s)]
*  It's like they blast Elon they blasted a big but like aren't these principles like shouldn't they just be? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1901.64s)]
*  Universal that we should not be wasting money and stuff [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1908.08s)]
*  Sure, of course the I mean so to give some credit, you know, you have Rokana supporting it [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1911.0s)]
*  You have Fetterman supporting it Bernie Sanders, you know, everybody Bernie Sanders had a good call out for Elon [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1917.16s)]
*  You have everybody has their thing in the government budget that they don't like so is assuming that they see that as something toge can contribute [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1923.24s)]
*  To you could probably get actually broad support [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1929.48s)]
*  You know, there's a classic, you know sort of reflex within within probably Democrat Party on at this point [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1931.76s)]
*  Just because of Elon's support of Trump [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1937.92s)]
*  That that if something is a is an Elon project [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1939.92s)]
*  They're gonna the the circuit are gonna instantly respond no matter what the thing is as a negative [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1942.8000000000002s)]
*  Without you know, kind of actually saying is this this is actually support actually something I do agree with and so that's all partisan [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1947.92s)]
*  None of its first principles, right? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1955.3000000000002s)]
*  Which isn't everybody that's gonna be true of both sides like Michelle Obama [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1959.3200000000002s)]
*  Michelle Obama was like let's get kids healthy and all of a sudden now it's in vogue to do that [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1963.28s)]
*  So I think I think we're just in an environment where where any anything will become partisan [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1968.36s)]
*  what's interesting is is that because of the you know, some of the the cross-party elements of of [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1973.72s)]
*  Trump and now his cabinet is it might pull in more more of the Democrat Party than than would usually happen and [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1979.72s)]
*  And I think because of Elon and the people that are sound surrounding Trump [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1985.96s)]
*  you probably have a bit more air cover for the Rokana's of the world to also step up because [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1989.88s)]
*  If it was like Steve Bannon and Trump doing Doge it would be like, okay, you know [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1994.7s)]
*  Maybe this is not the thing to you know lend credibility to for for pure political reasons [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=1999.1200000000001s)]
*  If you have, you know [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2003.3400000000001s)]
*  Some of the best entrepreneurs that are out there actually like literally in the cabinet driving this [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2004.8200000000002s)]
*  At some point, you know, it's it is an IQ test if you're if you're on board or not [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2009.98s)]
*  Shabath this is a sea change that we're seeing and to Aaron's point this administration gets to pick their priorities [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2014.5s)]
*  But everything can't be a priority or it's not a priority [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2021.6s)]
*  Therefore they've picked the priority of smaller government more controlled spending over say mass deportation or [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2024.76s)]
*  Removing more rights from women to choose when they have an abortion, etc [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2032.0s)]
*  So this seems like a distinctly different focus for Trump 2.0 the second term [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2035.9199999999998s)]
*  What are your thoughts on what we saw this past 72 hours? It was the most this bill. It was the most incredible [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2041.3s)]
*  Incredible [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2047.92s)]
*  Change in how politics will be done going forward I think that people [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2050.12s)]
*  are probably underestimating what happened here. This was a [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2055.4s)]
*  multi hundred billion dollar [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2060.88s)]
*  grift that was stopped on a dime over [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2063.92s)]
*  12 hours of tweets [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2067.8s)]
*  You would have never thought that that was possible. The point is to put a dagger in something that big [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2070.7200000000003s)]
*  That had so much broad support just a few hours earlier [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2077.5600000000004s)]
*  I think it's so consequential in how the United States can run going forward [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2082.28s)]
*  So building on what you said, Chamath also very [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2088.04s)]
*  Interesting here is the fact that Trump hasn't taken office yet and they're having this huge impact [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2091.5600000000004s)]
*  This is occurring a month before he's even in office if they can stop this [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2096.76s)]
*  What will they do when they actually are in power? [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2101.7200000000003s)]
*  I think right now you're seeing the first-order reaction which is about the bill itself [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2104.4s)]
*  And I think that misses the point the bigger issue is going forward [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2109.6800000000003s)]
*  you will have the ability to and [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2114.1600000000003s)]
*  Part of it is because we have a set of tools now that allows us to do this [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2117.92s)]
*  To read 1500 pages in a matter of minutes [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2121.56s)]
*  To summarize it into the key essential elements to really understand what's being asked and what's being offered and [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2125.0s)]
*  Then to put it in a digestible format that normal people can consume [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2133.32s)]
*  Then all you'll have to do is just connect the dots and tell your congressman [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2138.08s)]
*  Or congresswoman that you'd like or dislike this thing and what you're gonna see is a much more [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2142.0s)]
*  Active form of government and I think that's the really big deal [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2146.48s)]
*  The fact that it's it really becomes the voice of the people now the alternative can also happen imagine [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2150.32s)]
*  There is a piece of legislation [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2157.06s)]
*  that is [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2159.6s)]
*  Very controversial, but it turns out that people actually want it [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2161.04s)]
*  Then the opposite will also happen and can also happen now [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2165.48s)]
*  So I think that it's a very nuanced and interesting way that governance can happen [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2168.92s)]
*  the other thing that I'll say though, which is funny is we should have a segment called today in hypocrisy and [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2173.12s)]
*  If I was running the segment what I would say is today in hypocrisy [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2178.7599999999998s)]
*  You have a group of people ie the Democrats who are very upset and who now point to [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2182.96s)]
*  Elon as sort of like some shadow cabinet minister or some shadow president-elect or some shadow first buddy, right? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2191.04s)]
*  First buddy. I love that except then I thought to myself. Well, hold on a second [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2199.12s)]
*  Like there was like some something untoward happening in the shadows and I thought well actually this is the exact opposite [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2204.36s)]
*  The guy is tweeting in real time his stream of consciousness. You absolutely know [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2210.2s)]
*  Everything that he wants because he just lays it all bare and at the same time [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2215.84s)]
*  I thought it was really interesting the same people who were saying that [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2220.44s)]
*  Were the ones that finally admitted that they were hiding Biden for the last two years [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2223.4s)]
*  And I thought did we just miss this like the same people that are like, hold on Elon [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2228.0s)]
*  I don't like the fact you're telling us what you actually want on Twitter [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2232.76s)]
*  Transparently while we hide our president of the United States in a box [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2236.6s)]
*  Well, yes, so you're referring to a Wall Street Journal story that broke [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2241.7200000000003s)]
*  Think this week in hypocrisy Jason take it away. Yeah, I mean it was just [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2245.96s)]
*  As we said on this pod [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2250.68s)]
*  We knew that they were hiding him now the cover-up is worse than the crime and the cover-up is a cover-up [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2252.2000000000003s)]
*  They were not letting him take meetings. They were limiting access to him Dean B Phillips came on this program [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2258.64s)]
*  Shout out to him. Congratulations [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2265.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, he just told the truth here. He's not up for it. He's sundowning, you know terrible situation [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2267.88s)]
*  people get old and people [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2275.36s)]
*  Have cognitive decline the end question hold on a second [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2277.76s)]
*  So just to get contrasting compare Trump is not even in office, you know [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2281.8s)]
*  Elon is not a member of the cabinet per se these are [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2286.6s)]
*  Effectively today still private citizens when there's all of this noise about what happened over the last two days to stop an absolutely ridiculous [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2291.1600000000003s)]
*  pork barrel bill [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2297.92s)]
*  But when are we going to double-click into what decisions have been made in the last two years that were actually Biden's versus? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2299.8s)]
*  Surrogates that just decided and who gave them the authority to make those decisions if they're gonna do Aaron and you and I are [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2306.16s)]
*  Left-leaning moderates. I think that would be the most accurate way to describe us [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2313.04s)]
*  I mean if they want to do an investigation there should be an investigation to [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2316.7599999999998s)]
*  Did they know that he was in massive cognitive decline and let him stay in charge of the nuclear codes [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2321.16s)]
*  Do you agree or disagree? [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2327.3999999999996s)]
*  This is this is sort of not not the part of politics I think about as much so I'll leave that up to you as the [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2330.4s)]
*  Other left-leaning moderate. So yeah [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2336.26s)]
*  No, I just wonder if like this is a crime that they like what if it turns out he actually has Parkinson's or Alzheimer's like a diagnosis [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2338.44s)]
*  It's not out of the realm of possibility that they covered up an Alzheimer diagnosis Chamath [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2346.96s)]
*  And if they did is that criminal? I [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2352.84s)]
*  Mean it's unethical it's deeply unethical. Yeah, it's very dangerous. Yes [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2355.3199999999997s)]
*  again, it just goes back to [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2363.12s)]
*  The people elected Joe Biden. He won fair and square. He ran on a specific mandate that the people endorsed. I [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2365.64s)]
*  Just think it's devious though that certain figures in that White House [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2373.44s)]
*  Took a level of power and decision-making authority that they were never entitled to if if they wanted that [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2378.36s)]
*  They should have run and they should have been elected [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2385.08s)]
*  That's what we all sign up for and so I think that that idea that we let that happen [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2387.88s)]
*  Or that that happened to the American voting public is I think very unfair [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2392.6s)]
*  That's why I think you have to realize that and you've said this before [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2398.7599999999998s)]
*  We need these [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2403.04s)]
*  Checks and balances going forward and I think the way that you have these checks and balances again is veer towards transparency the more [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2404.3599999999997s)]
*  Transparency there is and again, this is where I'll say [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2411.6s)]
*  You may or you may or may not like Donald Trump [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2414.9199999999996s)]
*  But the one thing you will never have to be worried about is whether you will not be able to hear from him in first-person [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2417.8999999999996s)]
*  You're gonna hear from him. That is absolutely true [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2426.12s)]
*  I mean simple suggestion here Chema if you're ever in doubt [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2429.2799999999997s)]
*  You will be able to know very quickly where he stands on whatever topic is important to you [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2432.52s)]
*  And I think that that idea is very important because then if it's filtered through somebody else [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2438.4799999999996s)]
*  Because of some health issue that's then covered up [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2444.0s)]
*  We're making decisions that impact the entire world. We're making decisions that impacts the economy. We're making decisions that touch [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2447.4799999999996s)]
*  Hundreds of millions of American lives who are making those decisions. Yeah, it's kind of crazy [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2454.56s)]
*  I have a simple suggestion here with these bills, by the way when they're 1500 pages [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2459.8s)]
*  How about for every hundred pages you release you have one day of review? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2463.44s)]
*  So if you want to release 1500 pages 15 business days review [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2467.4s)]
*  That's I'm reasonable maybe three weeks and then just stop doing 1500 at a time break these things up into two or three hundred pages [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2472.04s)]
*  At a time. I just love the fact that people are [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2478.48s)]
*  Motivated and they have the will and the desire to focus on these [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2482.4399999999996s)]
*  focus and desire [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2487.3199999999997s)]
*  because people have to have the will and people did not have the will to get in the weeds and [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2488.9599999999996s)]
*  Examine the spending and now it's becoming [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2493.3199999999997s)]
*  Like in vogue, it's becoming a pastime to question the spending [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2496.3999999999996s)]
*  This is a really great moment in time for America [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2500.3199999999997s)]
*  The other thing Jason that we haven't done is I think that killing the bill was step one [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2502.48s)]
*  The thing that America has not yet seen and I think Aaron brought this up with the Patrick Collison tweet [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2508.0s)]
*  Which is just excellent Nick if you just want to put it up there. It really is true [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2513.7200000000003s)]
*  America still believes that the more you spend the more you get [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2518.52s)]
*  We do at the core [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2523.4s)]
*  That's why there are 1500 pages of spending in here because people want things because they want things to be better [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2525.44s)]
*  What we need to train people to understand is actually [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2531.7999999999997s)]
*  That it's the lies that are told that make you think that with more money comes a better outcome [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2535.9599999999996s)]
*  And I see every day in Silicon Valley [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2542.52s)]
*  We all start with next to nothing as a startup and we outmaneuver and we out execute companies all day long with way more [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2545.0s)]
*  Resources, so it is nothing to do with the resources [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2551.9199999999996s)]
*  Contraint leads to great art Aaron your thoughts. No, I mean, I can't add that much more to this [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2555.56s)]
*  I think it's there's probably a little bit of a disconnected times from the let's say the voting public and and you know [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2559.94s)]
*  broad constituents from then those that have sort of seen this in real life being inside of a company having to you know [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2567.54s)]
*  do a startup and scaling up and and [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2573.78s)]
*  just this [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2576.3s)]
*  the perverse incentives to build bigger teams spend more your project then is more important the more dollars it gets [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2577.86s)]
*  We have all of these systems in place which is the stuff that gets attention are the things that you spent more on [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2585.38s)]
*  So you have all these weird incentives to actually have your thing literally cost more [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2591.38s)]
*  To have you know more overhead because you've brought in more contractors into the project that then you know [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2596.2200000000003s)]
*  You're gonna get some you know kind of future benefit from in some way [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2601.78s)]
*  So you have a lot that is sort of fully broken in this and and there's no [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2605.5s)]
*  There's there's yeah, it's hard to imagine any other way to veer off from that path other than something that does shake things up [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2611.2200000000003s)]
*  You know as much as doge is doing all right. Listen, we can't do any worse than being massively in debt [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2617.14s)]
*  So just let's have a culture. Yes, we can. Yes, you can you could you could have run away dead [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2622.9s)]
*  This is for people who maybe are rooting against Trump in the audience or rooting against this because they're super partisan [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2630.46s)]
*  All I'll say is I know these individuals around Trump root for them and root for this process, please [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2637.38s)]
*  Because this is a path to fixing the most acute existential problem [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2643.5s)]
*  We have which is our debt you don't have to like Trump to like Elon to like the vague and to like these other individual sacks [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2648.08s)]
*  Included there are great people who are being called to serve. Let's judge them based on their performance [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2655.38s)]
*  That's all I ask for the people who hate [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2662.08s)]
*  Trump who hate these individuals judge them on their performance. They've come out with a bold plan. Let them cook [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2665.38s)]
*  Once they've cooked then judge their results [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2671.9s)]
*  That is what I'm telling everybody who hates Trump and who hates this administration and was partisan on the other side [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2674.54s)]
*  Yeah, let him cook judge the results [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2681.06s)]
*  I'll just throw out one more one more thing in this because I think doge has the branding of doge is is [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2682.86s)]
*  Often the efficiency side which people always go to the the spend side [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2688.62s)]
*  But the corollary to that is the regulations that obviously are expensive to maintain and and that's what creates layers and layers of overhead [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2692.86s)]
*  on reviewing everything that's coming in then to the government and [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2701.06s)]
*  and you know, unfortunately, we have great examples in California where where literally we spend more to do less and [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2705.46s)]
*  And it's because we've ratcheted up these layers and layers of regulation and I have friends literally doing climate tech in [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2713.1s)]
*  In in like climate tech you couldn't imagine something more probably left-leaning [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2719.98s)]
*  Democrat that they can't actually get things done in California the state that that you would imagine to be the most kind of climate first [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2724.3s)]
*  You know friendly state because of the amount of regulation that prevents them from getting things done. So so, you know [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2730.6600000000003s)]
*  There's there's actually this like, you know total combination of actually fewer regulations. You'll spend less money in government [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2737.54s)]
*  You'll actually grow the economy faster which will create more jobs like all of the things get solved the more efficient you get [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2744.54s)]
*  You know kind of large on all of the topics. So this is spending great point Aaron regulations next [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2751.82s)]
*  Let's see what they do there. I was in the room when Antonio Grasso's was doing zero [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2758.58s)]
*  Based budgeting at Twitter now X and Sax and I were looking at roles for people [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2763.86s)]
*  What the what this team can do in terms of making things more efficient [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2770.36s)]
*  It's amazing what can happen when you do zero based budgeting and when you just think from first principles [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2774.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, do we even need to do this? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2780.58s)]
*  Does this need to exist take all these regulations put a 20-year clock on half of them a 10-year clock on the other half [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2782.58s)]
*  Okay, can I just get one more random example feel free to edit it out Chamathia like this because it came out of Metta [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2789.48s)]
*  Do you follow the Z standard compression? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2794.76s)]
*  Library from Metta so open source library kind of a [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2797.7599999999998s)]
*  Next-gen compression on data and we finally it took us, you know, probably too long [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2802.24s)]
*  But but the team worked insanely hard implemented this compression algorithm. We literally our uploads and downloads got faster [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2806.24s)]
*  we spend less money on on networking and compute and [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2812.64s)]
*  It took some reengineering of the system [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2816.7599999999998s)]
*  but like it like that's just like not a concept that the people go into problem-solving with which is like what if the [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2818.7999999999997s)]
*  Actually was cheaper to run and it was better and so think about all the systems of government that could be that could just be [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2823.7599999999998s)]
*  Upgraded and then you would spend less money actually maintaining them [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2830.16s)]
*  I mean we spend you know hundreds of billions of dollars wait way too much on legacy infrastructure technology [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2833.2599999999998s)]
*  We could automate more you could spend way less money and then get better outcomes [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2838.86s)]
*  So this is just happening everywhere and and I don't think people realize that the scale of the opportunity [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2842.12s)]
*  So and I'll just give an example when we went into Twitter. Nobody was coming to the office [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2847.28s)]
*  There were people who hadn't committed who hadn't come to the office who hadn't committed code in six months [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2852.4s)]
*  So what were they doing? Right? [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2857.84s)]
*  so you start looking at the data then they were spending an enormous amount of money on SAS software that nobody had logged into and [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2859.32s)]
*  Then they had desk software for route people around that was costing $10 per day per desk per, you know location whatever [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2866.2000000000003s)]
*  Nobody was coming to the office, but they were paying for software to route people to the right desk in office [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2875.2000000000003s)]
*  We'd eat the waste when I tell you the waste and the grift and I'll just call it what my interpretation is stealing [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2880.56s)]
*  They were stealing from those shareholders. The government is stealing from taxpayers. It has to be fixed [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2888.24s)]
*  Let our boys cook Trey Berg you get the final word before we go on to conspiracy corner [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2893.52s)]
*  You've got nothing. All right, let's go straight to conspiracy corner. Everybody put your tinfoil hats on there were drones over New Jersey [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2900.0s)]
*  Thursday morning the FAA banned drones [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2907.6s)]
*  breaking news in parts of New Jersey until January 17th due to quote unquote [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2910.88s)]
*  Breaking news special security reasons. They also warned that the government may respond with deadly force against drones [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2916.08s)]
*  Posing a threat this thing is getting crazier by the day [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2923.48s)]
*  There have been thousands of reported drone sightings in New Jersey and bordering states over the last week [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2926.56s)]
*  Here's some examples play the clip yada yada [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2932.4s)]
*  Until Thursday morning White House officials have been dismissive saying repeatedly that nothing significant is going on [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2935.32s)]
*  One of the theories was that there was a that the drones were looking for [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2942.0400000000004s)]
*  nuclear material aka a dirty bomb or lost radioactive material or [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2946.0400000000004s)]
*  The the ultimate a lost nuclear [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2951.7200000000003s)]
*  Bomb from like an actual nuclear warhead from ukraine [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2955.48s)]
*  On Tuesday morning the mayor of Belleville, New Jersey suggested the drones could be looking for that radioactive material that went missing on December 2nd [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2959.7400000000002s)]
*  That was radioactive material [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2966.94s)]
*  germanium 68 we'll get [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2969.2400000000002s)]
*  Details on that from freeberg in a moment [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2971.34s)]
*  And then of course conspiracy theories are going wild. It's iran. It's ufos and my favorite project blue bean [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2974.3s)]
*  Which is that nasa is using holograms and other technology to create a new world order and religion and projecting jesus into the clouds [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2981.0200000000004s)]
*  You can look that stuff up or we'll have alex jones on in sax's seat one week [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2989.1800000000003s)]
*  Okay, freeberg, you're the genius here. Tell us what's going on. I think there are three [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2993.5s)]
*  Likely explanations. The first is that the government's got some activities that can't be disclosed [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=2998.1400000000003s)]
*  So we don't know and they can't talk about it. No one can neither [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3003.26s)]
*  You know say yes or say no to it. So, you know, that's kind of one that that's pretty possible. The second is [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3006.1400000000003s)]
*  These are just individuals with a bunch of drones messing around having fun trying to wreak havoc could be fun [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3011.82s)]
*  Bunch of kids. I think we've all been there [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3017.42s)]
*  The third is what I would call kind of a bit of a more nefarious like this is my conspiracy theory [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3019.82s)]
*  I think it it could be [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3025.1000000000004s)]
*  considered a psyop, okay, so [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3027.5s)]
*  Right now the u.s [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3031.5800000000004s)]
*  Has a significant regulatory burden on on drone utilization in a commercial setting [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3033.82s)]
*  And it's very hard to use drones. You have to have line of sight to the operator. These things aren't supposed to go on their own [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3040.0600000000004s)]
*  There's all these rules and restrictions and so on and so forth [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3044.86s)]
*  Meanwhile, you've got countries like china rocketing ahead. So I don't know if you guys know the company metuan in china [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3047.9s)]
*  You know the food delivery company? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3053.58s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3055.02s)]
*  Have you guys did you know that they do a large amount of drone delivery of their food now? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3055.58s)]
*  Was not aware of that. We're testing that here in the u.s [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3059.82s)]
*  The drone delivery business in china is already 30 billion dollars a year [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3062.38s)]
*  And they're also launching a pretty significant fleet of what we would call kind of the evitals or flying cars [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3067.26s)]
*  The expectation is that by 2030 there'll be a hundred thousand flying cars [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3073.02s)]
*  Moving people around in china and these are huge efficiency gains [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3076.94s)]
*  In fact with metuan you can now order food while you're on the great wall at one of the ramparts [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3079.98s)]
*  And it'll bring the drone will bring the food to you while you're walking the great wall as a tourist [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3084.14s)]
*  And in the u.s [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3089.5s)]
*  The reason that these things haven't taken off and the reason we don't have a large kind of drone industry [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3090.14s)]
*  Which is clearly emerging is going to be a huge economic driver for china and others around the world is simply the regulatory restrictions [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3095.1s)]
*  And so if you were going to try and mess with the u.s's ability to move forward with the drone economy [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3101.26s)]
*  You would probably try and wreak some havoc stoke some fear and get people to say hey [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3109.1800000000003s)]
*  This doesn't seem cool. What's going on? I don't like that. There's all these drones in the sky [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3114.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm freaking out and try and get the regulators to come in and say hey, we're banning drones and [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3118.6200000000003s)]
*  Set up everyone including the people in the government to say we should take a break [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3124.3s)]
*  We should think a little bit before we deregulate we should do this. Who's the motivation? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3129.58s)]
*  Postmates, no, no, no [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3136.62s)]
*  No, no, no, it could be the other government. Uh, that's my sci-op point [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3139.18s)]
*  This could be you're saying this could be china doing this to try to slow down our economy [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3143.1s)]
*  Think about it if you're gonna pass a bill in congress to make drones more freely roamable in the skies [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3147.1s)]
*  You're gonna reference back to this crazy story in new jersey. Everyone's freaking out about it and you're gonna say hey wait [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3153.18s)]
*  What about all that stuff that happened in new jersey? Maybe this doesn't make as much people are kind of scared about it [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3158.62s)]
*  We shouldn't rush. We shouldn't rush. We shouldn't rush. That would be my sci-op theory. That's my you know, kind of [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3162.94s)]
*  Conspiracy theory tinfoil hat I don't often do them but that's what I would kind of think about [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3169.0s)]
*  Alex jones be proud aron. Uh, why don't you jump the fence and tell us your best conspiracy theory of this? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3174.06s)]
*  No, no, I'm uh, this is that was all crazy pills when I just heard [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3179.2599999999998s)]
*  uh [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3183.5s)]
*  Yeah, take some I think there's like there's like 10 higher psyopsia you would do if you wanted to to get us to [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3184.94s)]
*  you know have a collapsing economy than going after drone deliveries, but [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3190.46s)]
*  Um, no, I what would they be? What would they be? I mean? [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3193.9s)]
*  I think you'd have ai like like do a robot that would I think you'd have a robot ai thing that goes [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3198.2200000000003s)]
*  You know runs amok. Um, that's a good idea rogue robot robocop. Yeah [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3204.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think that would be way sooner than you worry about food delivery. No, you have 10 self-driving cars hop the [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3207.98s)]
*  You know hop the curb and crash into a storefront self-driving is on ice for two years. That would be uh, you know an example [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3213.58s)]
*  Chamath your thoughts you you got some conspiracies here. What do you think's going on here? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3220.6200000000003s)]
*  No [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3225.82s)]
*  But I thought that the most credible thing was that they were they were looking for [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3227.1s)]
*  radioactive material [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3231.96s)]
*  That somehow some got lost and [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3233.5s)]
*  Why would they only look at night? [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3236.54s)]
*  Actually, it's interesting you say that [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3238.78s)]
*  There was somebody on twitter ex who claims to be an expert in this field and there's a startup actually [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3240.78s)]

*  It's a known threat. It's this is not rocket science. I'm sorry and why and why only at night? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3327.4199999999996s)]

*  I think that this is so interesting. So [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3537.26s)]
*  I was looking at all of these things if you if you put them all together it paints a really interesting story, so you have [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3539.5s)]
*  Elon filing an injunction which basically says you should not allow this conversion to happen [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3545.74s)]

*  It'll be very messy to go backwards. I think that that's a pretty credible legal argument [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3557.82s)]

*  Just what's happened in the last year [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3580.3s)]
*  And what do you notice what you notice is? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3582.7000000000003s)]
*  The market share [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3585.58s)]
*  Of open ai has changed pretty meaningfully [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3587.42s)]
*  from half to about a third and what you see is [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3591.1s)]
*  Anthropic doubled meta roughly staying the same google picking up steam and it started to make me think [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3595.16s)]
*  This is very similar [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3601.66s)]
*  to [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3603.5s)]
*  A chart that I would have looked at when you know in [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3605.18s)]
*  2006 and 7 when we were building facebook because we had this huge competitor in my space [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3608.92s)]
*  That was the de facto winner [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3614.94s)]
*  And we were this upstart and it made me think is there a replay? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3617.1s)]
*  Of this same thing all over again where you have this incumbent that pioneers an idea [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3622.14s)]
*  And they start with 100 share [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3629.66s)]
*  And then all of these upstarts come around from nowhere and then I thought well, what is better [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3632.3s)]
*  Today if you are a company that's just starting versus if you were the incumbent [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3637.98s)]
*  And I think that there's a handful that are worth talking about so the first is [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3643.1s)]
*  when you look at what [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3648.46s)]
*  X ai has done with respect to nvidia gpus the fact that they were able to get [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3650.22s)]
*  100 000 to work as you know in one contiguous system [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3655.24s)]
*  And are now rapidly scaling up to basically a million over the next year. I think what it does jason [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3659.42s)]
*  It puts you to the front of the line [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3664.14s)]
*  For all hardware [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3666.54s)]
*  So now all of a sudden if you were third or fourth in line x ai is now first and it pushes everybody else down [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3667.98s)]
*  and in doing that you either have to buy it yourself or work with your partner and I think [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3674.22s)]
*  for the folks like meta that [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3679.1s)]
*  Translates and explains why they're spending so much more sort of like this arms race [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3681.72s)]
*  If you can't spend with my competitors, i'm just going to prefer competitor to you [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3685.7400000000002s)]
*  So I I think that that creates a capital war in a capital war. I think the big companies like google [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3690.7s)]
*  amazon microsoft [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3696.9399999999996s)]
*  Meta and brands like elon will always be able to attract effectively infinite capital and their cost of capital goes to zero [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3699.4199999999996s)]
*  Which means they'll be able to win this hardware war. Okay, so put a pin in that [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3708.3799999999997s)]
*  Then the second thing is what happens on the actual data and experience side on the training side [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3713.58s)]
*  If you listen to ilia suzkaver if you listen to andre carpathy what they effectively are saying is there's this [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3718.7s)]
*  Terminal asymptote that we're seeing right now [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3724.94s)]
*  In model quality. So what happens? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3727.74s)]
*  A lot of these folks are now experimenting on the things around the model, right the user experience how you use it [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3730.62s)]
*  Can I keep things in memory? Can I cut and paste these things from here and there? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3735.74s)]
*  Because what it says is like the data is kind of static and brittle [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3740.14s)]
*  But it's actually not that's what we said before because you have this corpus of data on x that's pretty unique [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3743.98s)]
*  I suppose if elon fed in all this kinetic data that he controls through tesla, that's very unique [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3750.06s)]
*  Does that all of a sudden create this additive pool of information? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3757.98s)]
*  possibly [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3762.3s)]
*  And then the third thing is when you look at that chart what that chart says is hold on a second. Why are corporates? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3763.98s)]
*  moving around and what I can tell you just through the 80 90 lens is [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3769.58s)]
*  We are completely promiscuous in how we use models [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3774.62s)]
*  And the reason is because these models [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3778.78s)]
*  Offer different cost quality trade-offs at different points in time for different tasks [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3781.6600000000003s)]
*  and so [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3787.26s)]
*  What we are seeing is a world where instead of having two or three models you rely on you're going to rely on 30 [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3788.3s)]
*  Or 40 or 50 and you're going to trade them off and you're going to use effectively like an llm router to [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3793.42s)]
*  Distance, you know to balance them. Yeah and to route or just or just to manage and route them [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3799.1800000000003s)]
*  And then there's an intelligence above that that's constantly tasking and figuring out prompt optimization across these models [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3803.42s)]
*  So it's this thing where we were very reliant on open ai [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3809.42s)]
*  Now we're reliant across three or four ideally will be reliant on 30 or 40 [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3813.58s)]
*  And so I just see this world where it's all getting commoditized quite quickly [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3820.14s)]
*  And so i'm just like sort of scratching my head like where is the market value here arin your thoughts? [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3825.1800000000003s)]
*  I know you're very promiscuous when it comes to llms as well [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3829.98s)]
*  Uh, I I mean, I we have a very similar model as what schmoss said, which is we're agnostic [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3833.5s)]
*  so we work with multiple ai vendors, but the um, uh, I I think the [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3838.14s)]
*  A friend deep in ai land a couple years ago right before chat bt said there's no secrets in ai [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3842.86s)]
*  And I didn't totally understand kind of at the time it hadn't registered what that meant [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3849.02s)]
*  But very quickly it kind of became obvious, which is the research breakthroughs [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3852.38s)]
*  sort of [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3856.78s)]
*  Propagate insanely quickly across the ai community and so back back to schmoss framework if you just think about it is as if the research [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3858.54s)]
*  Effectively becomes open at some point in time quickly enough because either the researchers move or people publish it or whatnot [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3867.34s)]
*  Then it really is a compute game and then maybe a data access game [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3873.42s)]
*  And that means that there's four or five at scale players that can that can fund this [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3876.7s)]
*  and [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3881.2599999999998s)]
*  And I think as we've seen in other areas where it's an infrastructure play [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3882.3s)]
*  You eventually have the underlying service with enough competition [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3886.22s)]
*  You have the underlying service eventually trend toward the cost of the infrastructure [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3890.22s)]
*  So so what we should expect is that the price of a token in ai land, you know [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3894.06s)]
*  basically will be whatever the price of running the computers are and [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3899.48s)]
*  Maybe with like a you know, plus 10 20 margin. Did you see the same thing happen with storage? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3904.54s)]
*  I remember in the early days box and dropbox and youtube you all had this major innovation with storage [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3908.94s)]
*  And yes, how did that play out? Let me give you a fun stat. We give our customers unlimited storage [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3915.34s)]
*  We have 82 gross margin [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3920.38s)]
*  so [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3922.6200000000003s)]
*  So the the what happened was the price of the underlying storage has gone down by hundreds of times since we started the company [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3923.26s)]
*  And then all our value is in the software layer on top of the storage [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3931.26s)]
*  So we've benefited by this incredible just you know [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3934.94s)]
*  Ruthless competition between western digital seagate other players that are just trying to pack more [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3938.0600000000004s)]
*  More more, you know, basically more storage density into these drives and every couple years they have a new breakthrough [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3943.9s)]
*  We're now, you know upcoming we're up. We're heading toward maybe a 50 terabyte hard drive when we started the company [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3949.82s)]
*  They were kind of 80 [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3954.7000000000003s)]
*  Uh 80 gigabytes how much of your time in the early days was spent on dealing with this infrastructure issue? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3955.9s)]
*  And then how much of your time and your leadership team's time is spent on this issue now? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3962.3s)]
*  Yeah, so so back in the day like if we had, you know 10 10 people in in engineering, you know [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3966.94s)]
*  80 of them was doing, you know pure infrastructure work now if we have a thousand people [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3971.58s)]
*  Uh, you know be inverted in terms of the ratio [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3976.38s)]
*  So you just get you get more leverage both as the the you know as you get the advancements in the technology [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3979.1s)]
*  But then also as you get scaled but all of this is to say [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3984.86s)]
*  You should basically anticipate a world where and and I think zuck is this interesting counterbalance on all of this because of open source [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3988.38s)]
*  If at any moment, you know that that zuck will will basically provide an open source model [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3994.7s)]
*  That is at at kind of best in class benchmarks [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=3999.66s)]
*  And and at the at the frontier [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4002.8599999999997s)]
*  Then there is a limit on how much you can charge for the tokens of your hosted model because anybody will then be able to [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4004.94s)]
*  Go host the open model and and be able to provide infrastructure around it [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4009.8199999999997s)]
*  So so if you always have that counterbalance and the tokens eventually kind of look the same [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4013.18s)]
*  The output tokens kind of look the same. Isn't it? Yeah always isn't it also the truth that major enterprises [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4018.62s)]
*  Fortune 500s 200s, you know 20 years ago weren't interested in open source and now that's kind of their default [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4025.44s)]
*  They want to buy into open source because they don't want to be locked into a vendor [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4031.68s)]
*  It's actually not even necessarily the case that the that the customer has to pick the open source vendor [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4035.2799999999997s)]
*  They might buy it through an abstraction layer that that is letting them get the benefit of open source [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4039.3599999999997s)]
*  But but still buy through a proprietary. So you believe open source wins [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4044.3199999999997s)]
*  I believe in ai no, no [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4048.48s)]
*  So I believe open source causes pricing to always be extremely low, right? But so okay [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4050.72s)]
*  But in this case, do you think open do you think open source is going to ultimately win the day in models? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4055.84s)]
*  No, not necessarily you don't know because only only meta has the has the the scale to be able to provide [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4061.04s)]
*  I think what erin is saying here. Let me let me try to frame. I think what he's saying is there'll be [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4066.8s)]
*  Open source models. There'll be close source models [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4071.52s)]
*  But the price that erin or me or anybody else pays these model makers will effectively go to zero got it [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4074.96s)]
*  And it'll go to the cost of the compute to be to be clear with a little bit of margin for for the energy [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4082.56s)]
*  The physicality of that compute got it [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4088.0800000000004s)]
*  Now it's important to step back and say I still think you could probably have the entirety of the model providers make 10 times [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4090.1600000000003s)]
*  More revenue than they do today because we're just literally in like the first percent of the total tan [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4095.6800000000003s)]
*  So so it'd be a mistake to think that that has you know [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4101.28s)]
*  Some kind of downward pressure in in terms of the long-term economics of these businesses [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4103.92s)]
*  Especially because I think open ai's revenue stream is increasingly looking like a sas revenue business as opposed to just you know [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4108.08s)]
*  Just the api kind of token pricing [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4114.08s)]
*  So so none of this is is to you know provide any any sort of color on like what would you bet on today? [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4117.12s)]
*  I I agree with shimoth that you're going to have maybe not 30 providers [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4122.08s)]
*  But let's say you at least have you know five to ten good choices all all competing heavily for the next breakthrough like literally this morning [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4124.4800000000005s)]
*  Google had a breakthrough in sort of this reasoning oriented model from from their flat from their gemini family 2.0. Yep [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4130.08s)]
*  Yep [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4137.28s)]
*  And uh, and and so what's what's incredibly, you know kind of great is it's it's sort of the best time ever to be building software [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4138.0s)]
*  Assuming, uh, you know assuming that that you have a play in the market that lets you remain differentiated [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4145.1s)]
*  And the key there is just do enough on top of the ai model that there's enough value [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4150.4s)]
*  Do you know how much the world spends on software and software related things every year? It's about [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4154.48s)]
*  five trillion dollars [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4160.08s)]
*  so there's like call it like a trillion and a half of [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4162.24s)]
*  Software licenses a trillion and a half of consulting and a trillion and a half of it folks inside of companies [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4166.56s)]
*  Plus or minus a little bit more you get about five trillion and that's compounding 13 percent a year [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4172.72s)]
*  I [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4178.08s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that the market here shrinks by [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4179.04s)]
*  An order of magnitude and instead of fighting over five trillion. I think we'll be fighting over [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4183.6s)]
*  500 billion [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4189.120000000001s)]
*  What are you Aaron you buy that? No, not at all [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4190.96s)]
*  Uh, I mean, I don't know if you want to make the case more but but well [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4195.04s)]
*  the only reason is that I think that as [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4198.96s)]
*  We delever the software development process from humans [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4201.52s)]
*  I think the unit cost of creating code effectively becomes so cheap that it's going to be very hard to differentially price [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4204.72s)]
*  These products the way that they are so an example would be that [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4211.52s)]
*  Let's say you use I don't know pick your [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4215.52s)]
*  favorite piece of software [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4219.04s)]
*  I don't want to pick on anyway, that's why i'm not saying i'm just saying office suite. Let's pick an office suite. Everybody's got one [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4222.0s)]
*  Sure, actually, let's pick let's pick on excel because maybe that's like sure excel google sheets. Yeah, it's not it's not that excel isn't valuable [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4228.4800000000005s)]
*  It's incredibly valuable. It's what is the marginal cost of creating the excel equivalent that is good enough that people switch [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4235.52s)]
*  the marginal cost today is very expensive and you can see that because [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4241.6s)]
*  It's what it costs google to make sheets [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4246.160000000001s)]
*  but that's humans so the real question is if you have a [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4249.52s)]
*  Legion of bots that works 24 7 [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4254.56s)]
*  incrementally and increasingly more accurately every day [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4258.14s)]
*  The question is what is the marginal cost and I think the marginal cost of that is going to be very cheap and when you do that [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4262.4800000000005s)]
*  It's very difficult to price it anywhere near the same and the reason is that [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4269.52s)]
*  Other companies will then replicate it and say hold on if if excel wants to charge a hundred dollars [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4274.400000000001s)]
*  I'll charge 50 and i'll take a lower margin. That's just supply demand economics. Yeah. Yeah, so [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4279.6s)]
*  So so I think I I think there's [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4286.16s)]
*  I I just don't agree with the tam compression because I think there's another kind of counter event that's happening [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4289.52s)]
*  That ai is is really going after like services and and so that then then conversely expands the tam the software [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4294.16s)]
*  Where it budgets weren't usually applied to those types of things but we can get into that in a second [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4300.96s)]
*  But I think we've already seen I think we've already seen this though and it hasn't exactly played out as as you're saying [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4305.04s)]
*  So you already have like a zo like so zoho is this really interesting business [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4310.08s)]
*  It's probably a couple billion in revenue at this point [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4314.32s)]
*  And it's basically a suite of of extremely low cost affordable [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4316.64s)]
*  Right, but the cycle time of zoho is poor, but and it's not that's not been that's not been the reason people don't switch though [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4321.12s)]
*  They don't it's all it's all levered to humans. I just think it's not a good product. It's it's decent enough [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4327.76s)]
*  Why do you think people don't switch? Aaron? [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4333.04s)]
*  Yeah, I do agree with you. Aaron by the way that when you bring sir that [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4335.76s)]
*  Whole offline services category online and you automate them with ai [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4339.6s)]
*  I agree with you that that tam could be ginormous [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4343.68s)]
*  All i'm saying is right the traditional software attempt today what people spend 5.1 trillion dollars on [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4346.16s)]
*  I think people will spend 500 billion dollars on and barely if that [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4352.16s)]
*  There are there may be other things that people spend money on that that are that are wrapped in ai [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4357.52s)]
*  Yeah, I I guess the the the the counter and maybe you look at an erp system or a crm system or something else like [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4361.92s)]
*  Like it that that is sort of like those things are totally screwed [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4368.56s)]
*  No, but like but but this is my point the opposite like the last thing you want to touch is the system that is like [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4372.5599999999995s)]
*  Like powering your supply chain companies the companies I talked to they're consistently like rip it out [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4378.88s)]
*  Get us to a point where we can rip it up [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4384.08s)]
*  And the reason is because what they've realized is they'll spend 50 to 100 million dollars a year for five features [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4385.679999999999s)]
*  And they're like just give me these five features as workflows. Yes [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4391.599999999999s)]
*  Give me a simple crud database and just get me get out of the way and it's like [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4394.8s)]
*  the trade-off for that [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4399.2s)]
*  Makes a lot of sense because look let's face it like when you have to build one piece of software that has to sell to [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4401.5199999999995s)]
*  50 000 companies the reality is that that piece of software is trying to do everything and then some [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4407.179999999999s)]
*  And it's trying to solve two or three use cases plus around, you know, five or six common use cases that are generalized [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4413.84s)]
*  Yep for 50 000 customers. So you end up with 50 000 features, you know, it's really interesting because arron you kind of [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4419.92s)]
*  Alluded to there's a tam expansion moment there and i'm seeing this on the front lines [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4426.24s)]
*  We run a program founding university. I've talked about it here before where we see people pitching us [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4432.08s)]
*  They're year zero startups two or three person teams and what they're doing is they're not going after existing legacy software [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4436.8s)]
*  They're kind of going after jobs [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4442.64s)]
*  They're looking at a position or a job somewhere. This is an accountant. We're going to take an accountant [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4444.88s)]
*  We're going to make the number one accountant in the world. That's an ai [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4450.16s)]
*  Agentic an agent we're going to make a podcast producer with podcast ai we're going to make a virtual assistant with athena [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4454.48s)]
*  We're just seeing it over and over again. That's a whole nother category [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4460.96s)]
*  Where you study a person's behavior as they work a social media manager and what they do and then you replicate it [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4465.44s)]
*  With ai and that's something that just hasn't previously been done [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4472.88s)]
*  So there could be two things occurring here chum off and arron at the same time, which is a deflation in [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4475.84s)]
*  Legacy systems and they'll be replaced and then additionally [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4482.32s)]
*  Human capital and jobs that are easy enough for ai to do as an agent will also expand the tam [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4486.64s)]
*  You're at the same time. You are [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4493.68s)]
*  Completely right about the usage all i'm debating is when you have to price something [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4496.3s)]
*  You have to look at the total cost of what it took to make it [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4502.32s)]
*  And then you want to try to build in a reasonable amount of margin and some reasonable expansion and you discount it back [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4506.88s)]
*  And this is what you think it's worth [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4512.24s)]
*  Even though you may not think you're doing that when you implicitly price something that way that is what's happening underneath the hood [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4514.0s)]
*  to the unemotional buyer of that good and all i'm saying is [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4520.32s)]
*  if what arron says before which I agree with is true, which is [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4525.04s)]
*  The cost of using a model to get to an output effectively goes to zero [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4529.84s)]
*  The it's somewhat what i've been saying before the marginal [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4534.48s)]
*  Cost of compute goes to zero the marginal cost of energy goes to zero [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4537.759999999999s)]
*  The real question is what does it take to make a good in the digital world? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4542.4s)]
*  Let me ask free burn question here. You're back in the ceo slot at ohalo. You're doing it every day dave [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4546.5599999999995s)]
*  You're making these choices as to what's sas products and how you're going to solve problems [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4552.4s)]
*  Are you looking at it saying i'm going to hire developers who can work 10x because of all these new tools [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4556.719999999999s)]
*  And i'm going to build my own internal systems or are you looking and saying i'm going to buy off the shelf [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4561.92s)]
*  Sass products. What are you doing when you make your own decisions every day david free burn? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4567.92s)]
*  Well, I try and encourage the teams to [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4573.360000000001s)]
*  Build stuff [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4576.96s)]
*  That better meets our needs and then it can actually [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4578.8s)]
*  Be a better solution and it can be built in house [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4582.72s)]
*  And I think we did a I think I mentioned this the last episode but we did a hackathon where we brought in people [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4585.12s)]
*  To learn how to use cursor and chat gpt to build software that had never done it before to try and create this as a [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4590.88s)]
*  Capability for people broadly in the organization and they were great tools that came out of it [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4597.82s)]
*  So I think that that's really the future [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4601.68s)]
*  As and this is kind of like, you know, i'd say early generation, but as we get to further later generation [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4603.92s)]
*  capabilities [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4609.18s)]
*  You could see [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4610.56s)]
*  The instruction to a chat gpt or like interface [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4611.92s)]
*  Hey, i'd love to do the following things with a piece of software shows you a couple options you pick one [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4615.04s)]
*  Shows you a couple ux you pick one it does user testing automatically for you. It does qa for you [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4619.92s)]
*  And ultimately it puts it into production for you, which is the biggest challenging step right now [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4624.64s)]
*  You still need engineers that can load stuff into production and do qa, but if all of that gets automated as well [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4628.96s)]
*  Now any user in a company can actually stand up software to do something for them a non-developer you're saying non-developer [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4634.32s)]
*  Stand-up software maybe so jamath just to clarify. Are you [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4641.52s)]
*  There's two different ways to approach the lowering the cost of developing software [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4645.84s)]
*  One is that it just creates more [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4648.88s)]
*  Competitors in each of these categories which then lowers my price because now there's there's some downward pressure dave's bringing up a different example [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4651.1s)]
*  Which i'm going to build my own software [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4656.400000000001s)]
*  at effectively the price of zero [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4658.4800000000005s)]
*  The the challenge on this especially the second one is is like when you like most organizations don't want to be in the business [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4661.52s)]
*  Of having to think about about building their own software [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4667.12s)]
*  They just like want it done for them [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4669.68s)]
*  Like it's like not a core part of of their like so, you know [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4671.12s)]
*  Your business would be very unique relative to the broad economy [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4674.64s)]
*  Which is like I just want like just like I want a place to put my crm records [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4677.44s)]
*  I want a place to like just like have my hr get managed and I think the downward pricing pressure [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4681.28s)]
*  Due to software cost lowering makes total sense. I don't think it's a 10x factor [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4685.839999999999s)]
*  but [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4690.88s)]
*  But but you know, I think that we've always had a long tail of applications that that enterprise has built [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4691.839999999999s)]
*  You do that at microsoft access now you do it in retool [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4698.32s)]
*  So the next era of that will be obviously ai built and there'll be 10 times the amount of that software [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4701.36s)]
*  But it's not obvious to me why that would go after the kind of core [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4706.639999999999s)]
*  The the core systems of running a business because just most companies are like not looking to reinvent the wheel of that [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4709.759999999999s)]
*  We're working with an aerospace partner won't say who it is [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4714.719999999999s)]
*  And we sat there and they walked us through [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4718.48s)]
*  What they deal with to make the things that they're making it's convoluted and this is not a software problem [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4722.08s)]
*  It's that there is no piece of software that understands how they want to run their company [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4729.04s)]
*  And so instead they have to morph their org chart to the tools that are available [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4733.5199999999995s)]
*  So I think what freeberg is saying some is some version of that as well [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4738.5599999999995s)]
*  He's probably there were probably people there using the tools that were available [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4741.44s)]
*  And as a result at some point some hr person said we need to hire this other person and this other person [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4745.92s)]
*  And instead what what it allows companies to do is just completely reimagine. How do you want your company to work? [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4751.28s)]
*  And what is the business process you actually need to? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4758.16s)]
*  Implement and then let's just get that built [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4761.4400000000005s)]
*  And you know, I I don't know if you guys saw this but satya nadella had this clip that's gone pretty viral [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4764.64s)]
*  In the last couple of days where he effectively said the same thing and what he's effectively saying is [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4770.72s)]
*  all these big [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4775.76s)]
*  software systems are business rules [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4777.200000000001s)]
*  wrapping a database plus [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4779.92s)]
*  An incredible go-to-market team [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4782.320000000001s)]
*  You know, and this is what alex carpe points to as [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4785.52s)]
*  Sharp knives [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4788.96s)]
*  Steak dinners and basketball game tickets. I don't know if you guys saw that clip. I did see the clip [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4790.72s)]
*  Yeah, he likes to win based on product not on sales effort nick. You should find this clip. We don't play golf [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4796.0s)]
*  What we do do is we play software [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4802.72s)]
*  We will put if you want to actually compete compete on your product and what's very special and and yes [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4804.88s)]
*  Do I enjoy humiliating people who have better steak dinners and sharper knives and better golf sleeves? Yes, I do [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4811.36s)]
*  You know what? I really I really like that we win in that way [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4817.12s)]
*  It makes me very happy and it makes our clients happy [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4819.84s)]
*  But it really points to the heart of how the software industrial complex. That's what I call it this [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4822.88s)]
*  5.1 trillion dollars this software industrial complex. How has it evolved? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4828.86s)]
*  I think it's people that build good point products [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4833.6s)]
*  But when the market meaning the shareholders and the public investors demand growth [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4837.04s)]
*  You have this natural expansion and what do they do they inflate the feature set [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4841.92s)]
*  they inflate the cost and then in order to sell that they inflate the set of [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4847.599999999999s)]
*  Incentives that they give to the buyer. So the cio [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4854.0599999999995s)]
*  Inside of these large organizations, they control budgets. They're equivalent to like [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4858.4s)]
*  State level budgets in some cases, you know, what do you think the cio of a top five bank is spending? [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4863.5199999999995s)]
*  It's probably 15 to 20 billion dollars a year. They are getting wined and dined [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4868.96s)]
*  To a way that you could not even imagine. I don't even think the ceo probably understands [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4874.56s)]
*  And that filters down through the org and so they don't like totally ruin our whole game here [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4879.52s)]
*  Well, i'm just pointing it out like it's I mean i'll say the game on the field [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4884.8s)]
*  But here but here's another part of the game in the field if these tools [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4890.0s)]
*  Make your team. Yeah, 10 [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4894.0s)]
*  26 percent whatever you can quantify more effective at their jobs [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4896.16s)]
*  Then it's a de minimis amount for most organizations who have created very profitable businesses [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4901.04s)]
*  I see this where I was mentioning some companies earlier and their sass pricing [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4906.8s)]
*  Is broken because the number of employees at a company has been going down because people are getting more efficient [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4911.76s)]
*  So now they're looking at saying well, what value do we provide with this podcast? You know producer in a box and whatever it does [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4917.28s)]
*  They say they were starting with like 99 a month or 49 a seat [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4924.4800000000005s)]
*  I said listen just charge a minimum of 500 to get the software nobody complained [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4928.4800000000005s)]
*  And they got rid of the bottom tiers. So there's a value being created here [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4933.68s)]
*  That is so great that I don't think everybody's going to roll their own like freeburg because they'd be like, you know what? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4938.4800000000005s)]
*  This is so great. It's 6 000 a year. Yolo. I'll just buy it it is today [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4945.12s)]
*  And in five years just like we're all gonna and we're all using [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4950.96s)]
*  Chat like interfaces more frequently. Yeah, you go to your chat like interface and eventually [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4956.08s)]
*  You realize you can ask it to build some tool for you that does something [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4961.28s)]
*  And it renders the tool and it makes it possible and it stands it up in production and suddenly you're using it at your company [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4965.36s)]
*  And then you ask it to do another tool and it does it exactly to spec and you define [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4972.4s)]
*  The ux you want you define what you want it to do and it works and it interoperates [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4976.639999999999s)]
*  But you and really clearly and really cleanly with the other tool and there's a big aspect of this where you can start to build [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4981.5199999999995s)]
*  All of the software infrastructure that you as an organization [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4988.08s)]
*  want right, but I think you and erin you and erin mentioned this though [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4991.599999999999s)]
*  The extreme difficulty is not that front and part that's easy. It's like [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=4995.599999999999s)]
*  I think it's less than three or four percent of the work [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5000.639999999999s)]
*  The 96 percent of the work is how you actually integrate it in the back end and how do you provision it? [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5004.240000000001s)]
*  How do you have controls and how do you do security? [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5009.4400000000005s)]
*  Because if those things fail and those are implemented in a bot in a highly regulated market as an example [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5012.0s)]
*  You may not actually be allowed to operate. Let's go through that example and let's say that you're in a bank [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5018.56s)]
*  And you tell the ai [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5024.160000000001s)]
*  Figure out all the security and permissions and and authority rules that are necessary for me to operate as a bank [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5026.160000000001s)]
*  And it can actually render it it sounds far-fetched today [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5031.599999999999s)]
*  But there's no reason that in seven years that is not the standard de jure [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5034.16s)]
*  That I don't have the ability to say go look at all the software that's out there in the world today [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5038.08s)]
*  So that helped me build a tool that meets compliance standards that meets all of my security standards [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5041.679999999999s)]
*  And you can actually instruct the ai to operate like a large number of software engineers [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5046.24s)]
*  No, I think to operate today the practical issue where the rubber meets the road there is when there is a penetration [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5050.799999999999s)]
*  And a regulator who's a human because it will not have been a bot [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5057.759999999999s)]
*  Comes and knocks on your door [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5061.44s)]
*  And you're like well, here's this immutable log of the things that I did and they're like I don't want an immutable log [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5063.2s)]
*  Who the hell tested this show me the unit test that you created and signed off on [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5069.28s)]
*  So there's a there is a critical human in the loop problem on that other 95 percent [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5073.599999999999s)]
*  Which is where I agree with Aaron in in in reach in in like stage one like we're in stage zero [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5078.879999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, you won that you will need no, but you'll I think it's in stage five and six [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5083.679999999999s)]
*  I think you'll need governments to take an entirely different risk posture for highly regulated markets [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5087.76s)]
*  I don't see that happening in any in any time in the near future in life sciences [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5092.400000000001s)]
*  If you want anything in a clinical system [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5096.88s)]
*  I don't need to tell you guys this but you have to you have to [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5098.72s)]
*  Do a qa test on every single change that ever happens and be able to prove that you tested every single thing [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5100.88s)]
*  So so the idea of a probabilistic ai system generating that the kind of code for you, you know in a clinical trial, you know workflow [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5106.400000000001s)]
*  Like I just think yeah, it's going to take a lot of change from from regulators [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5114.0s)]
*  Another decade of evolution here to make these things sustainable and have a high quality [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5117.84s)]
*  I think it'll happen faster than everyone thinks [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5123.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think actually that's that's like there's actually no reason why that wouldn't be a good thing if that did happen to be clear [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5125.76s)]
*  I I think though back to to you know, jason's earlier point though, like then the counterbalance on the tam compression is [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5131.280000000001s)]
*  Is just now the the sort of thing that we think of as software that market now is is much larger [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5138.0s)]
*  So if you're if you're selling if you're selling yeah, yeah [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5143.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so but like but like that means that if you're selling let's say 50 000 of security software [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5146.24s)]
*  You know, maybe that goes down a little bit to you know, 25 000 dollars [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5151.12s)]
*  But but you might yeah, but you might sell exactly an agent of new agent [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5154.16s)]
*  Yeah, but that I so I agree 100% with that [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5158.48s)]
*  My only comment is the software industrial complex today has to shrink because the stranglehold that it has on how companies run [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5160.8s)]
*  Is incredibly high for an experience. That's incredibly poor [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5169.5199999999995s)]
*  Hmm nobody nobody raises their hand and says gosh this piece of enterprise software that I use in my day-to-day life is as good [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5174.4s)]
*  As instagram or tiktok nobody says that [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5180.4s)]
*  Well, I mean except about box. I was reading the reviews earlier today [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5183.28s)]
*  And that was on g2 or one of those sites and it's just box was just a rating for a tremendous. So [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5186.5599999999995s)]
*  I love box. I love that's incredible. Well, I mean, I mean just to what's the ticker symbol? [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5192.5599999999995s)]
*  Is it dollars? We try to make it very simple for people. So is it dollar box? Is that what it is? [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5197.759999999999s)]
*  I'm putting a j-trade in here because I may have to j-trade this [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5203.759999999999s)]
*  It sounds like a really great opportunity for me. All right, listen, erin you just got kramer [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5208.16s)]
*  What was your last year? Yeah, you got great. My last j-trade is i'm just i'm i'm loading up on [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5212.16s)]
*  Mstr and bitcoin i'm doing a i'm shorting bitcoin and i'm buying mst. I don't know what that i'm not i'm not trading stocks right now [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5217.58s)]
*  I'm focused on investing in 100 startups [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5224.48s)]
*  Per year 100 new startups per year i'm putting the first check into them. That's what I do [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5227.28s)]
*  All right, listen enough. This has been a great episode arin. You're amazing. Thank you for coming on constantly everybody follow [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5232.56s)]
*  What is your twitter app on ai? Can I just tell you guys are you at levy or at arin? [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5239.12s)]
*  Uh, yeah, yeah, I love you. Yeah, is that the french pronunciation? [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5243.6s)]
*  Have you guys seen the vo model [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5249.12s)]
*  From google. Yeah, have you guys talked about how google has like gotten some religion? [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5251.12s)]
*  They are they're back in the game baby. I [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5255.92s)]
*  Literally paid out up to sundar. Uh, yeah, and serguei's going to work every day by the way [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5259.04s)]
*  He's at work. What can brown do for you jay cal sundar back in the group chat? Okay, by the way [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5263.36s)]
*  Did you guys see genesis yesterday? Well, okay, let's let me just put this up here and then i'll tee it up to your free break [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5267.759999999999s)]
*  Google has been putting out new models. They have this new google gemini [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5273.759999999999s)]
*  And they have one with deep reasoning and their 2.0 model. I did a side-by-side test same prompts [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5278.5599999999995s)]
*  With our friends in deep madra on this week in startups just this week [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5284.24s)]
*  We did multiple tests. He was he has the oh one pro the 200 per month [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5288.08s)]
*  Gemini was beating that hands down for me [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5293.76s)]
*  And I think he conceded that with their free model in their 20 model if we just gave a decent prompts [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5297.280000000001s)]
*  I think google now has reached parity and they have an app out freeberg. What are your thoughts because people were counting them out? [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5302.72s)]
*  And here we are. I think not only have they caught up [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5309.4400000000005s)]
*  I think they have exceeded. What are your thoughts? They were late [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5312.88s)]
*  The compounding effects are playing out and it's only going to continue to compound and I will say the data repository at google [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5315.2s)]
*  The engine that they have the infrastructure the team everything down to components is advantaged [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5320.72s)]
*  And so everyone's been kind of counting them out, but it's clear [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5325.12s)]
*  They're in it to win it. They're here free bird [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5327.92s)]
*  70 of the usage of [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5330.22s)]
*  Open ai is consumer 70% consumer. What does that mean for them as as gemini and google get get momentum? [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5332.5599999999995s)]
*  I think you'll end up having a gemini that has ads [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5339.5199999999995s)]
*  eventually [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5343.58s)]
*  And you could pay and have no ads or you could not pay and have no meaning [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5344.88s)]
*  Do you provide enough value and of enough quality where folks don't need to then folks stay on google? [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5349.04s)]
*  On google.com i'm asking you whether it impacts open ai the quality of gemini as it increases or do you think that these [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5356.16s)]
*  Usage cohorts are roughly set [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5362.4800000000005s)]
*  I jump back and forth personally my experience is I don't feel like i've got embedded data on open ai [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5365.04s)]
*  Or on gemini that makes me stick with one. I'm just like with google. I'm going to go to the best [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5370.400000000001s)]
*  Interface the best engine [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5374.88s)]
*  So I do think that there's fungibility here and people will move over [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5376.56s)]
*  As they realize better results better performance, but I will say that what we're seeing now with the data advantage at google [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5379.92s)]
*  So, you know the internet all these llm's are our language models trained on text from the internet, right? [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5385.6s)]
*  There's call it 50 billion words on the internet and I think if you estimate the data repository in these training sets, it's like [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5390.64s)]
*  Probably a couple terabytes one to five terabytes or something like that [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5398.32s)]
*  But if you look at the the the the video data that's out there [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5401.599999999999s)]
*  There's hundreds of billions of hours or 100 billion plus hours of video data a large amount of that is sitting on youtube [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5405.679999999999s)]
*  And by some estimates, there's a thousand exabytes of video data on the internet [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5411.84s)]
*  So about a billion times more video data than there is word or text data [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5415.599999999999s)]
*  And I think we just saw that play out with the vo model that launched yesterday, but here's some examples of vo [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5421.36s)]
*  Google has all of this youtube data, you know, whether or not they're using it to train [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5426.88s)]
*  I don't know the answer. I don't think they're allowed to is what I heard from the insiders [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5430.08s)]
*  They have to redo the terms of service to get explicit permission to use it [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5433.44s)]
*  But you're right. These models are tremendous whatever they're using and it's basically rendering physics or it looks like it's rendering physics [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5438.4s)]
*  Now genesis came out yesterday [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5444.0s)]
*  And it's open source so you can actually go play with this genesis model, which similarly [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5446.16s)]
*  renders the actual 3d objects into a 3d environment so you so rather than rendering a two-dimensional set of pixels [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5451.5199999999995s)]
*  To look at a video visual with genesis as you can see here [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5460.08s)]
*  you can type in a prompt and it renders this extraordinary video that that [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5463.44s)]
*  Also has underlying it the three-dimensional objects that make up the video [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5468.08s)]
*  Which means you could change the angle right and you could work with it and also with google and this you can start to implement [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5473.12s)]
*  three-dimensional models based on some prompt that says something like I want to have the camera angle at this point in the room [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5480.22s)]
*  I want to have the room look like this [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5487.28s)]
*  I want to have this color this wallpaper [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5488.72s)]
*  And suddenly everything starts to prompt in a way that you can actually render in real time [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5490.72s)]
*  A video game a movie a visual experience and it goes to this point that we're unleashing [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5496.0s)]
*  The capacity for human imagination and creativity with these systems because it's no longer just a look-alike two-dimensional image [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5501.68s)]
*  It's now an actual three-dimensional object that then renders the visuals to make this happen [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5508.4s)]
*  So we're starting to see I think the next era of these models that goes beyond just text prediction [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5512.719999999999s)]
*  What do you think erin? Yeah, there was another release last week of a experimental project for browser use [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5518.0s)]
*  By gemini, which is another advantage because youtube has obviously an incredible amount of screen sharing data [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5524.08s)]
*  And and videos so so you have you know, like like we think about visual is just like okay [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5529.599999999999s)]
*  It's it's going to be you know for for developing [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5534.16s)]
*  You know cg characters or something but it's it's actually just like like just all the use cases of a computer [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5537.76s)]
*  Are also on youtube project mariner is the name of it, right? [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5543.5199999999995s)]
*  Where your chrome extension ai can control your browser to do things [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5547.599999999999s)]
*  And then if you go to the ai studio from gemini, they they have a mode where you can turn on your webcam [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5551.04s)]
*  And and then you you basically it has full visual [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5556.96s)]
*  uh kind of access to anything [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5561.04s)]
*  And and so they're they're cranking and it's super exciting because [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5563.92s)]
*  Like just you can tell that google's woken up [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5568.48s)]
*  And and they are just on full assault. So I mean just in 10 days the quantum the ai [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5571.2s)]
*  Open source gemini updates. It's like every morning you're waking up to a sundar tweet [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5577.36s)]
*  That is that is some new breakthrough. So well, yeah [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5581.76s)]
*  It's amazing when you fire 20 000 people who weren't doing any work and were involved in dai [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5584.08s)]
*  Nonsense and then you yeah [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5589.200000000001s)]
*  That's not the point the point the point is they've had this compounding and you know infrastructure advantage data advantage [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5593.04s)]
*  Personnel advantage and now they were just a little late to the game [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5599.4400000000005s)]
*  But when you but they were also distracted is my point they were distracted with nonsense, you know, that's true [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5602.72s)]
*  Come on. The first version of this came out. It was making abraham. Remember remember african-american and [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5607.6s)]
*  Okay, that's you rosters asian. You know, like they were distracted [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5613.280000000001s)]
*  Okay, a big part of google's orientation historically has been don't mess the don't mess up the machine a classic kind of big company dilemma [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5616.799999999999s)]
*  Where if I do something that's either disruptive to my core business or if I do something wrong where I will invite regulatory and consumer scrutiny [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5624.96s)]
*  I'm going to get wrecked and so they avoided launching stuff early [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5631.599999999999s)]
*  And what they've done is they've changed the posture in the last two years [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5634.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and now the posture is launch early launch aggressively push hard [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&t=5637.92s)]
