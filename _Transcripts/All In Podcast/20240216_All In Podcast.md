# E166 Mind-blowing AI Video OpenAI launches Sora + Is Biden too old? TuckerPutin interview & more
**All In Podcast:** [February 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc)
*  Saks, how's tequila? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=0.0s)]
*  I tasted 10 samples the other day. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1.76s)]
*  One was heads and shoulders above the rest, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  which was a good sign. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=7.76s)]
*  Oh. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  So now we're taking that and making it the new baseline. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=9.64s)]
*  And I'm going to try 10 more samples. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=12.44s)]
*  And we're going to go from there. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=14.16s)]
*  I think we're very close to having something excellent. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=15.56s)]
*  And then I did a side-by-side taste test of the sample [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=18.28s)]
*  I like the best compared to Claas Azul Ultra. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=21.8s)]
*  And it was already better than Claas Azul Ultra, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  which retails for like $3,000 a bottle. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=28.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=30.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=31.48s)]
*  Holy sh-t. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=31.8s)]
*  So it's going to be better. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=32.36s)]
*  V1's better than their final product is what you're saying. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=36.2s)]
*  And that was not just your taste test, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=36.96s)]
*  but like you and several people? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  It was me and two other guys who I trust. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=40.72s)]
*  So we did it together. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=42.36s)]
*  Now, when you say trust, do you mean underlings? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Or do you mean actually like? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=45.68s)]
*  No, he means alcoholics. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Where in your pay hierarchy are they? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  He recruited them at Alcoholics Anonymous in West Hollywood. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=51.72s)]
*  Are they level two employees or level four employees? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=55.08s)]
*  One works for me and one's a consultant. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=57.8s)]
*  I'll say both works for me. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=60.4s)]
*  So they're both on the payroll. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=61.6s)]
*  ["I'm Going All In"] [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=62.76s)]
*  We'll let your winners ride. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=64.24s)]
*  Rain Man, David Sack. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=67.04s)]
*  I'm going all in. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=68.36s)]
*  And instead, we open source it to the fans [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=71.36s)]
*  and they've just gone crazy with it. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=73.64s)]
*  Love you, West. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm the queen of Kim Wams. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=75.8s)]
*  I'm going all in. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=77.48s)]
*  OK, are we over or underestimating [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=79.88s)]
*  the impact of the AI boom? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=82.12s)]
*  NVIDIA's been on an all-time heater. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=83.92s)]
*  If you don't know, its market cap is now $1.8 trillion, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=85.52s)]
*  Friedberg. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=89.0s)]
*  This week, it surpassed Google and Amazon [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=90.36s)]
*  as the fourth most valuable company in the world. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=93.52s)]
*  There it is, folks, right behind Saudi Aramco. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  16 months ago, stock was trading about $112 a share. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  Since then, share prices have gone up 6.5x on a big number. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=106.32s)]
*  Shares went higher this week after it [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  was reported that NVIDIA plans to build custom AI chips [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=111.08s)]
*  with Amazon, Meta, Google, and OpenAI. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=114.72s)]
*  In other news, Financial Times reported OpenAI [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=118.32s)]
*  hit a $2 billion run rate for their reoccurring revenue. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=121.32s)]
*  It's about $165 million a month. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=125.84s)]
*  And they think they can double that number in 2025. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Tons of competition coming out. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=131.36s)]
*  If you didn't see, Google rebranded [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=132.72s)]
*  their generative AI suite to Gemini, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=134.92s)]
*  and they're charging $20 a month for it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=136.72s)]
*  And then there was this bizarre Wall Street Journal headline [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=140.28s)]
*  that Sam was going to raise $7 trillion. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=143.12s)]
*  That makes no sense. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=145.08s)]
*  Maybe that was the TAM. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=146.08s)]
*  We'll get into that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=148.08s)]
*  Freeberg, your thoughts on this ascension. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=149.44s)]
*  Are we underestimating or overhyping AI? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=152.36s)]
*  I mean, it seems like the compute buildout is underway. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  So this is going to continue for some time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  I think the real question that keeps getting asked [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=164.16s)]
*  is, when do you really see the tides recede and what's there? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=166.32s)]
*  The compute buildout is underway, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=170.68s)]
*  but are we seeing application and productivity [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=172.08s)]
*  gains associated with the capability of that compute? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  Some would say yes, some would say no. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=178.92000000000002s)]
*  But you've got to build out the infrastructure [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=180.84s)]
*  if you're going to assume that there's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  going to be these productivity gains in the application [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  layer. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  And everyone's assuming they'll be there, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=187.60000000000002s)]
*  so we need to meet the demand, which [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=190.48000000000002s)]
*  is almost like building out an entirely new internet. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=192.08s)]
*  And so the core of AI is this matrix multiplication problem. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  And you need these chips that do that really efficiently. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=201.12s)]
*  They're not traditional CPUs, which are general purpose chips, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=204.24s)]
*  but they're chips that are very special purpose [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=207.16s)]
*  for a particular set of applications [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=209.4s)]
*  that render the output of whatever model is being run. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=212.0s)]
*  It's sort of like the internet. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=215.16s)]
*  You could pretty much create a bogey of any number [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=216.52s)]
*  on how big this can get. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  At the same time, you're seeing some of the other players [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  with different architectures and potentially that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=225.6s)]
*  are going to be beneficiaries of this buildout [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=227.68s)]
*  because they're participants in other parts of the data center [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=229.44s)]
*  or alternative solutions like ARM. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=232.6s)]
*  And I don't know if you saw this, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=234.24s)]
*  but in just the last couple of weeks or last week or two, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=235.56s)]
*  ARM's valuation doubled. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=238.35999999999999s)]
*  It's come down a little bit since that big doubling. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=241.6s)]
*  Today, ARM is sitting at $140 billion valuation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=244.16s)]
*  Last week, it got as high as $156 billion. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=248.28s)]
*  And remember, it was only last August. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=250.68s)]
*  So if you guys remember, ARM was bought by Softbank and the Vision [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=254.32s)]
*  Fund. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=257.4s)]
*  And then I think 25% of ARM was held by the Vision Fund [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=258.84s)]
*  and 75% was owned by Softbank. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  Last August, Softbank bought from the Vision Fund [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=265.11999999999995s)]
*  the 25% that the Vision Fund owned at a valuation of $64 billion. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=269.96s)]
*  But now Softbank owns 90% of ARM. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=274.28s)]
*  The last 10% trades publicly. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=277.84s)]
*  So at $140 billion valuation, Softbank's position in ARM [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=280.35999999999996s)]
*  is $125 billion. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=283.96s)]
*  And I think it really begs the question, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=285.84s)]
*  did MASA have a masterful move here yet again? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=287.64s)]
*  Because everyone said for years, with all the bets [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=291.12s)]
*  this guy was making in the Vision Fund [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=294.2s)]
*  and some of the misguided bets he was making with Softbank [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  and the leverage he was applying on himself and Softbank [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=299.32s)]
*  to deploy all this capital during the ZERP era, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=302.12s)]
*  everyone was saying, this guy had a one hit. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=305.24s)]
*  It was Alibaba, and that was it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  And clearly, he doesn't know what he's doing. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=309.68s)]
*  But now, all of a sudden, his bet on AI was fairly prescient. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=311.64s)]
*  And it's paying off pretty powerfully. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=316.36s)]
*  He bought the whole business for $32 billion. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=319.24s)]
*  And now he has a stake that's worth $125 billion [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  seven years later. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=326.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, chip in a chair, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=327.04s)]
*  Well, it's really begging the question. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=328.56s)]
*  You only need one, the power law, right? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=329.92s)]
*  When you're making a long-term investment, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=331.64s)]
*  you can very easily look like a moron over the short term. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=334.0s)]
*  And to your point, the power law, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=337.32s)]
*  all it takes is one of them to work out, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=339.36s)]
*  and it can wipe out the losses on the rest of the portfolio. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=341.16s)]
*  And we may be seeing Masa, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=344.32s)]
*  with his whole AI vision story [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=345.64s)]
*  that he's been telling for seven years, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=347.08s)]
*  we may see Masa clawing his way out of the hole. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=348.84s)]
*  You only look like a moron to losers, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=351.48s)]
*  meaning when people were throwing shade at Masa, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  it wasn't anybody that's any good. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=359.4s)]
*  I didn't see headlines that said [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=361.48s)]
*  John Malone thinks Masa is a fraud, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=362.8s)]
*  Warren Buffett thinks Masa is a fraud. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=365.32s)]
*  Nobody was saying that, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=367.36s)]
*  because those guys know what the game is, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=368.92s)]
*  and the game is exactly what you said, J. Cal. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=371.48s)]
*  You must always survive, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=373.68s)]
*  and you need to keep your wits about you. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  And over time, if you're prepared and do enough good work, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=378.92s)]
*  you'll get waves of good luck that amplify your hard work. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=382.24s)]
*  And Masa is an example of an incredibly talented person [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=386.0s)]
*  that has found a way to survive more than anything else. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=389.48s)]
*  And so waves of success will hit him. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=392.32s)]
*  The people that complain are the ones [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=396.08s)]
*  that are sort of a little bit stuck on the sidelines [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=398.92s)]
*  and are more frustrated with their own impotence [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=401.88s)]
*  and inability to do anything. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=404.48s)]
*  Now, on arms specifically, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=406.0s)]
*  the thing that I would keep in mind [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=408.6s)]
*  is that those guys floated, I think, about 15 million shares. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=410.2s)]
*  So there's about 145, 150 million shares outstanding, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=414.2s)]
*  90% owned by them. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=419.4s)]
*  So there's about 10 or 15 million shares outstanding. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=420.92s)]
*  And there was about 12 and a half million shares short [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=423.96s)]
*  going into the earnings report. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=426.24s)]
*  And so the thing to remember is that there was [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=428.48s)]
*  almost an entire turn of the float that was short. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=431.24s)]
*  So I don't know how much of this reaction [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  was just an enormous short squeeze [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=438.44s)]
*  of people that were largely long other chip companies. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=441.96000000000004s)]
*  And so they thought they could short arm [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=444.92s)]
*  essentially as a spread trait to minimize volatility. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=447.64s)]
*  But this is an example of where [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=450.52s)]
*  if you don't do this analysis properly, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=452.36s)]
*  GameStop was another where you misjudge [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=455.2s)]
*  or you sub analytically look at the actual share count [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=457.8s)]
*  and what's actually free floating, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=462.4s)]
*  you can get caught on the wrong side [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=464.2s)]
*  and these things can be very violent. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=465.84s)]
*  And to explain the float to folks, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=467.8s)]
*  you can make a certain number of shares [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=469.96s)]
*  available to the public to trade. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=472.32s)]
*  When you have a small number of those, correct, Chamath, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=474.4s)]
*  available to the public, weird things can happen [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=477.15999999999997s)]
*  because there's not enough available to short. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=480.12s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=482.88s)]
*  And so that could have been the situation here [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=483.76s)]
*  with this run up. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=485.52s)]
*  But I think the overall point of placing bets [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=487.2s)]
*  and being a capital allocator [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=490.12s)]
*  is the important one to discuss here. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=492.16s)]
*  Sax, what are your thoughts on all the crazy bets [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=493.76s)]
*  that Masa made? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=497.8s)]
*  We watched a lot of our companies [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=498.84000000000003s)]
*  or companies adjacent to our companies [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=500.68s)]
*  get massively overfunded. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=502.24s)]
*  Some of them literally got drowned in capital, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=503.56s)]
*  but then you only need to hit one [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=506.6s)]
*  and maybe win it all back. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=508.12s)]
*  What are your thoughts on this high alpha [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=509.56s)]
*  betting style of his? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=514.16s)]
*  Look, I mean, he's a gambler [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=516.24s)]
*  and he is playing a power loss. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=517.76s)]
*  So he only needs one really big return [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  to basically make up for all the mistakes. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=522.64s)]
*  And it seems like he's hit that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=524.6s)]
*  Once again, he did it with Alibaba too, right? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=526.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he's a major gambler. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=528.44s)]
*  Most people would be a little bit more risk averse. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=530.4s)]
*  I don't think it was a great strategy [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=533.32s)]
*  to be pumping $500 million checks [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=534.72s)]
*  into what were effectively seed companies [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=536.76s)]
*  like they were doing with the Vision Fund. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=539.16s)]
*  However, obviously he made enough good bets [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=540.88s)]
*  that they're gonna pay off that fund. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=544.44s)]
*  Well, it's a good point, Sachs. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=546.72s)]
*  I mean, none of the big, I don't, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  I probably need to be careful [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=550.12s)]
*  because I'm not super familiar with the portfolio, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=552.36s)]
*  but it doesn't seem like any of the big winners [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=554.84s)]
*  were those seed bets. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=558.16s)]
*  Like he doesn't have any returns coming out of that [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=559.24s)]
*  kind of investment strategy. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=561.84s)]
*  DoorDash. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=563.6s)]
*  DoorDash. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=564.96s)]
*  Yeah, DoorDash was not, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=565.8000000000001s)]
*  like what point did they invest? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=566.76s)]
*  Billion or $2 billion round was? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=568.12s)]
*  Yeah, pretty important moment. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=569.64s)]
*  We've heard at dinner, Jason and I at dinner, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=570.9200000000001s)]
*  we've heard the waterfall from the SoftBank side [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=573.64s)]
*  and it sounds like it was an enormous number. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=577.6s)]
*  Yeah. That was definitely their- [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=581.08s)]
*  But it was a de-risked business. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=582.48s)]
*  It was a scaling business. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=583.96s)]
*  Seems a little different than some of these companies [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=586.28s)]
*  that were fairly early on [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=588.32s)]
*  that got monster valuations and large chunks of capital [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=591.08s)]
*  and then struggled to find ways to deploy that capital, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=593.8000000000001s)]
*  which led to unhealthy behavior. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=598.12s)]
*  I think the thing you have to give them a lot of credit for [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=599.6s)]
*  is it's so easy to give up [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=601.4s)]
*  when the peanut gallery is chirping. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  And so the thing that you have to give them [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=608.04s)]
*  a lot of credit for is [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=611.0s)]
*  he has the ability to tune those people out. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  Now he probably isn't even living in a world [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=614.92s)]
*  where any of those people, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=617.4s)]
*  that chirping even gets to him. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=619.0s)]
*  And I think that that's a very important thing. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=620.56s)]
*  But kudos to him. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=624.0s)]
*  I mean, to be able to tag something for 100 billion here, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=625.28s)]
*  70 billion there, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=629.12s)]
*  keep swinging. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=631.32s)]
*  And by the way, at the end of it all, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=632.1600000000001s)]
*  what is it gonna change for him? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=634.12s)]
*  Absolutely nothing, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=635.44s)]
*  except he'll have some incredible stories to tell [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=636.36s)]
*  about the vault that he took [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=639.2800000000001s)]
*  and the roller coaster ride he was on. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=640.48s)]
*  And I think that's gonna be the most valuable thing. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=642.32s)]
*  He's gonna be able to tell his grandkids these stories [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=644.24s)]
*  and their eyes will just be like, what? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=647.12s)]
*  And his friends, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=650.6s)]
*  I would love to have a dinner with him. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=652.08s)]
*  I don't know him. Yeah, let's do it. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=654.0400000000001s)]
*  We should have him on the pod. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=655.12s)]
*  Come on the pod, Massa, and let's talk about it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=655.96s)]
*  I've only met him once, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=657.52s)]
*  but I have a great story to tell about Massa [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=658.36s)]
*  when I was on Facebook, I met him once. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=659.92s)]
*  But anyways- [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=661.1999999999999s)]
*  Go ahead and tell it. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=662.04s)]
*  I mean, can you tell it? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=662.88s)]
*  All I'm saying is I would love to have dinner with him [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=664.0799999999999s)]
*  because I just want to hear these stories of vault, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=665.76s)]
*  like up and down and up and down and amazing. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=667.7199999999999s)]
*  I had two lunches with him. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=671.12s)]
*  We had lunch one day. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=672.52s)]
*  We had such a good time. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=673.56s)]
*  He said, can we have lunch again tomorrow? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=674.5999999999999s)]
*  How long are you in Tokyo? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=676.64s)]
*  I said, yeah. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=677.52s)]
*  And I came back the next day and I had lunch with him twice. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=678.36s)]
*  Oh, that's amazing. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=680.56s)]
*  And it was great. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=681.4s)]
*  Like talking two or three hour lunches [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=682.2199999999999s)]
*  where we're just talking about every web 2.0 company. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=684.16s)]
*  This was in the 2009 Uber kind of Robinhood period. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=686.88s)]
*  And he was just fascinated by what was going on [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=691.2800000000001s)]
*  and all the disruption happening. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=693.52s)]
*  DoorDash Series D, $1.4 billion post 2018, he did. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=695.24s)]
*  Well, the question I was asking is like, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=699.24s)]
*  DoorDash was a lot like an arm. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=701.24s)]
*  There's a point of view that the business has proven [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=704.6s)]
*  that there's a market that it can grow into, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=706.96s)]
*  that there's a management team [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=708.64s)]
*  that knows how to deploy capital [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=709.64s)]
*  versus a lot of these early stage bets [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=711.88s)]
*  where when they got too much money, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=715.24s)]
*  they ambled about, well, they didn't ambled about, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=717.86s)]
*  they kind of- [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=720.08s)]
*  Incinerated it. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=722.62s)]
*  Incinerated because what do I do with this money? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=723.64s)]
*  I don't yet have a machine or an engine [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=725.5600000000001s)]
*  that can grow with this money. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=727.16s)]
*  And until the engine can handle the capital- [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=728.96s)]
*  Like the pizza thing, like the pizza thing. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=730.4s)]
*  Zoom pizza you're talking about. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=732.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if you give- [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=734.26s)]
*  Well, there's dozens of them in that portfolio, right? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=735.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=737.36s)]
*  If you don't have a business that can handle the gas [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=738.2s)]
*  you're putting in the tank, the engine is gonna blow up. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=741.22s)]
*  The engine has to grow, it has to build. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=746.0s)]
*  The volume has to build [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=747.24s)]
*  so that it can actually handle the fuel. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=748.32s)]
*  And I think that's been part of the challenge. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=750.4s)]
*  And I will just say, I've said this in the past, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=751.84s)]
*  but there was an era in Silicon Valley [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=753.64s)]
*  that started around 2010, 2009, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=755.76s)]
*  kind of right after, right as Web 2.0 [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=759.84s)]
*  was starting to venture into more traditional markets, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=762.94s)]
*  meaning tech companies were becoming other companies. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=766.2s)]
*  Kind of the mobile local era was kicking off. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=768.72s)]
*  And there was a strategic concept [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=772.88s)]
*  that got popular in Silicon Valley on take the market, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=774.48s)]
*  which is when you feel like you could be the winner, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=777.52s)]
*  give the person all the chips and say, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=780.76s)]
*  now go over bet and take the whole market [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=783.1600000000001s)]
*  because these are gonna be winner take all, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=785.88s)]
*  or these could be winner take most markets. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=787.4200000000001s)]
*  So get first mover advantage, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=789.48s)]
*  here's more capital than you need. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=791.0s)]
*  And I remember being pitched this [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=792.64s)]
*  when I was raising my Series B [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=794.0s)]
*  that I should raise more than I was trying to raise [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=796.0600000000001s)]
*  because I should use the extra capital to take the market. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=798.8000000000001s)]
*  And then that mantra just became the de facto standard, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=801.36s)]
*  which is, oh, you have something that has something, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=804.4s)]
*  it has some edge, it has some advantage, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=806.48s)]
*  it started to move in the market. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=808.32s)]
*  Here's a ton of capital you don't really need. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=810.04s)]
*  Now go take the market. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=812.5600000000001s)]
*  And the reality is most of those businesses [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=814.32s)]
*  had absolutely no way of using that capital [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=816.12s)]
*  to quote take any market [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=819.12s)]
*  because they didn't even know what their market was yet. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=820.52s)]
*  Yeah, when you're in the product market fit phase [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=822.22s)]
*  and you don't have the engine as you called it, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=826.08s)]
*  how do you make the engine go faster? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=828.72s)]
*  You're literally trying to take a bunch of car parts [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=830.14s)]
*  and then run a Formula One race. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=833.06s)]
*  The car's not even track worthy yet. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=835.74s)]
*  And Catera, not to pick on any companies, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=838.18s)]
*  but I remember Catera, which was doing construction [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=840.78s)]
*  and they just thought they're gonna take over [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=843.78s)]
*  the whole construction industry with this company. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=844.88s)]
*  It raised like $900 million [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=848.26s)]
*  and I believe it's like a zero the whole way. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=850.1s)]
*  You can't put the money to use capital as a weapon [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=852.38s)]
*  maybe works if you're Uber, Lyft and DoorDash [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=856.06s)]
*  and you have customers and you can reduce the price. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=858.62s)]
*  Well, what's interesting is when you now look at all [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=860.86s)]
*  a bunch of these AI companies, every day, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=862.74s)]
*  what you see is every round is a minimum of $100 million. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=865.7s)]
*  But the dirty little secret is not that these companies [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=870.26s)]
*  have found product market fit [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=874.1s)]
*  or are scaling revenue massively. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=875.3s)]
*  I'm not talking about OpenAI, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=876.82s)]
*  I'm talking about these other long tail businesses. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=877.9s)]
*  The $100 million is largely going to compute. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=882.26s)]
*  But as we know, and I think we'll talk about this [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=885.0600000000001s)]
*  next week when all these announcements are done, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=888.9399999999999s)]
*  but you're about to see a one 10 thing of the compute cost. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=890.02s)]
*  And so what's interesting for those companies [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=895.14s)]
*  is they're gonna be left with a lot more money, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=896.9399999999999s)]
*  but back to Freebrook's point, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=898.62s)]
*  they may be ambling about with too much money at that point. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=900.7s)]
*  So today you raise $100 million [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=903.54s)]
*  because you need to spend 70 or 80 on compute. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=905.18s)]
*  Tomorrow when you only need to spend seven or eight [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=908.14s)]
*  for the same amount of throughput, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=910.1s)]
*  on one hand you could say, well, this is great. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=912.82s)]
*  I have so much more money I can spend. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=914.78s)]
*  But again, we've seen example after example [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=917.42s)]
*  where if you raise too much money when you don't need it, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=919.62s)]
*  you will just run yourself into a brick wall. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=922.02s)]
*  You'll over hire, you'll miss hire, you'll miss allocate. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=924.0999999999999s)]
*  And it just goes back to the same thing [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=927.6999999999999s)]
*  that we've said before, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=929.42s)]
*  which is there's just not enough people [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=930.26s)]
*  that actually know how to run companies. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=931.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and it just becomes a huge distraction. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=933.0999999999999s)]
*  Huge distraction. Did you see Saks today? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=935.14s)]
*  Sora, did you see Sora? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=936.5s)]
*  Good try by OpenAI. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=937.9799999999999s)]
*  This is breaking news right now. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=939.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is unbelievable. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=940.9799999999999s)]
*  If you haven't seen it, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=942.6999999999999s)]
*  Sora is the text video model from OpenAI. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=943.66s)]
*  They've been talking about this. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=946.42s)]
*  I guess this would compete with [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=948.62s)]
*  a stable diffusion to video as well. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=952.3s)]
*  Anyway, you give a prompt. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=954.74s)]
*  I'll just read this one out loud. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=956.38s)]
*  Beautiful snowy Tokyo city is bustling. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=957.4599999999999s)]
*  The camera moves through the bustling city street [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=959.3399999999999s)]
*  following several people enjoying the beautiful snowy weather [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=961.3s)]
*  and shopping at nearby stalls. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=964.14s)]
*  Gorgeous Sakura petals are flying through the wind [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=966.78s)]
*  along with snowflakes. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=970.26s)]
*  And this, if you weren't studying it, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=971.94s)]
*  would look like a major feature film or TV show. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=976.58s)]
*  Yeah, Saks? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=981.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's unbelievable. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=982.7800000000001s)]
*  I mean, it looks to me like 4K video. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=984.1s)]
*  I mean, I'm not sure it actually is 4K, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=986.62s)]
*  but it looks pretty darn close. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=988.22s)]
*  Yeah, the rendering resolution [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=990.7800000000001s)]
*  can be whatever you want it to be. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=993.0600000000001s)]
*  Right, the fact that you can describe [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=994.0200000000001s)]
*  the way that you want the camera to move. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=995.6600000000001s)]
*  So I'm gonna speculate on this. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=998.98s)]
*  You guys know I talked about this quite a while ago [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1000.6999999999999s)]
*  on how I think we're gonna be a prompt to video, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1003.26s)]
*  meaning people are gonna have personalized video games [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1006.74s)]
*  and personalized movie experiences and music eventually, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1008.9s)]
*  where rather than everyone watch the same product [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1012.54s)]
*  made centrally by a producer, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1015.38s)]
*  we'll all make our own product locally. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1017.42s)]
*  I spent some time digging into this over the last year. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1019.42s)]
*  And the big challenge was that the traditional approach [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1022.62s)]
*  for rendering video is you create three dimensional objects [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1025.1s)]
*  and then you have a rendering engine [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1028.1399999999999s)]
*  that renders those objects [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1029.42s)]
*  and then you have a system [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1031.34s)]
*  that defines where the camera goes. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1032.18s)]
*  And that's how you get the visual [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1033.66s)]
*  that you use to generate a 2D movie like this. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1034.9s)]
*  And the best tool out there is Unreal Engine 5, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1039.38s)]
*  which is made by Epic Games. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1042.14s)]
*  I don't know if you guys have ever seen the demos of it, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1043.34s)]
*  but I've seen it. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1045.06s)]
*  Yeah, it's really unbelievable. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1045.9s)]
*  Is that what Star Wars uses with their virtual sets now [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1046.74s)]
*  when they did the Mandalorian? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1049.62s)]
*  I think they're using the Unreal Engine or Unity. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1050.62s)]
*  They probably are. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1052.26s)]
*  And then there's other tools. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1053.14s)]
*  If you're in movie production, you'll use different stuff, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1054.34s)]
*  but Unreal Engine is just so incredible. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1056.3s)]
*  But it requires the placement [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1058.98s)]
*  and the rendering of 3D objects. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1060.6200000000001s)]
*  So where do those objects go? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1062.14s)]
*  And then the physics of the light moving [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1063.6200000000001s)]
*  off those 3D objects to generate a 2D video [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1065.5s)]
*  is pretty straightforward. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1069.06s)]
*  That's been done for 20, 30 years. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1069.98s)]
*  And so the density, the rate of improvement, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1073.1s)]
*  the color contrast, et cetera, has all improved, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1076.3s)]
*  made it look incredible. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1078.58s)]
*  Now it's super photorealistic [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1079.5s)]
*  and you can create photorealistic video. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1080.74s)]
*  But it still requires this concept [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1082.34s)]
*  of where are the 3D objects in 3D space? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1084.02s)]
*  This doesn't do that. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1086.94s)]
*  This was a trained model. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1088.98s)]
*  So we don't know what's going on in the model. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1091.02s)]
*  So how would you train a model to do this [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1092.9s)]
*  without having a 3D space? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1096.22s)]
*  Because clearly there's thousands of objects [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1098.3000000000002s)]
*  in that rendering. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1100.26s)]
*  If you look at that video, thousands of little objects. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1101.1000000000001s)]
*  The compute necessary to define each of those objects, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1103.3000000000002s)]
*  place them in 3D space is practically impossible today. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1106.22s)]
*  So this is being done through some model [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1111.42s)]
*  that starts to render all of these things together. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1113.74s)]
*  So it is very likely, my guess is that OpenAI used a tool [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1116.98s)]
*  like Unreal Engine 5 and generated tons and tons [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1121.66s)]
*  of video content, tagged it, labeled it. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1125.78s)]
*  And we're then able to use that to train this model [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1130.1s)]
*  that can, for whatever reason that we don't understand, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1134.78s)]
*  do this. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1137.38s)]
*  Make the output. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1138.22s)]
*  But what's interesting is that this output [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1139.06s)]
*  underneath it. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1141.94s)]
*  You're referring to synthetic training data. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1142.78s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1145.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1146.26s)]
*  But what's amazing about this model is that underneath this, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1147.46s)]
*  this model on its own has rendered physics. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1151.46s)]
*  So all of the rules of physics, all of the rules of motion, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1154.34s)]
*  all of the rules of perspective, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1157.1s)]
*  all of the rules of how objects sit upon one another [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1158.98s)]
*  next to each other, how fluids move. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1161.46s)]
*  If you look at some of the other demos on this tool, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1163.3s)]
*  you can actually see fluid moving. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1165.98s)]
*  It's rendering the movement of fluid [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1168.1s)]
*  or rendering the movement of hair. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1169.98s)]
*  Those are like physics models that would typically [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1171.78s)]
*  be deterministically written, meaning [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1173.94s)]
*  that a programmer, an engineer writes the physics. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1175.86s)]
*  And then the Unreal Engine renders the physics. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1178.34s)]
*  In this case, the model figured out the physics. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1181.46s)]
*  And the model probably did it in such a reduced way [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1184.3799999999999s)]
*  that you could use a reduced amount of compute [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1187.22s)]
*  to generate something that would otherwise [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1189.62s)]
*  take a ton of compute time. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1191.42s)]
*  I mean, look at this. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1192.8999999999999s)]
*  It's truly amazing. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1193.98s)]
*  Nick, find the one of Golder's retrievers playing in the snow. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1195.02s)]
*  This is way better than this. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1197.94s)]
*  But what's amazing is that the, and by the way, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1199.02s)]
*  if you're listening to this, I really [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1200.66s)]
*  recommend going on Twitter and typing in OpenAI, Sora, S-O-R-A, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1201.8600000000001s)]
*  and looking at some of these demo videos. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1206.26s)]
*  It's bonkers. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1208.0600000000002s)]
*  And I think it really speaks to what's so incredible right now, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1209.0600000000002s)]
*  which is that software is writing itself. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1212.14s)]
*  And it's replacing a lot of human determinism. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1214.66s)]
*  The way that humans think about constructing software [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1217.02s)]
*  is being completely redone with these learned models. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1220.94s)]
*  This model learned physics on its own. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1224.22s)]
*  And it renders this thing that looks like the only way [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1226.5800000000002s)]
*  we know how to do this today is to create 3D object [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1228.78s)]
*  models in 3D space and use tons of compute to render the light. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1231.1s)]
*  And just to translate that from geek to people listening, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1233.86s)]
*  this is incredible because Pixar spent years, maybe a decade, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1239.1399999999999s)]
*  trying to figure out hair. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1243.02s)]
*  I remember talking to Ed Capnil. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1244.34s)]
*  And he told me hair was just so hard to get right [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1245.74s)]
*  with wind and lighting. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1248.34s)]
*  They literally built the physics engine for years, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1250.62s)]
*  like maybe even a decade, to make hair [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1252.98s)]
*  cross the uncounted valley. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1255.78s)]
*  What you're saying here, Friedberg, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1257.1s)]
*  is somehow this language model, this image model, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1259.2199999999998s)]
*  just outputs it. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1262.58s)]
*  And it doesn't actually have a physics model. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1264.54s)]
*  It just outputs it, correct? [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1266.4199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1267.6999999999998s)]
*  Well, we don't know. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1268.4599999999998s)]
*  But the model, there may be some determinism built into it. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1269.4199999999998s)]
*  So I don't want to assume anything. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1274.34s)]
*  But the general approach, determinism [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1276.4599999999998s)]
*  means you write the physics and you [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1278.8999999999999s)]
*  write the formula of the physics so [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1280.86s)]
*  that the software can execute the physics [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1283.02s)]
*  and render the thing. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1285.1399999999999s)]
*  But in this case, it may very well be the case, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1286.62s)]
*  like a lot of the other models that are being trained today, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1290.3799999999999s)]
*  when you create a model that trained, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1293.9799999999998s)]
*  that it's being trained. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1295.78s)]
*  And on its own, it resolves to figure out [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1296.7399999999998s)]
*  how to do the physics. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1300.1399999999999s)]
*  Is there a limit on the length of these Sora videos [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1301.2199999999998s)]
*  that you can generate right now? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1304.4199999999998s)]
*  It's one minute right now. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1306.4599999999998s)]
*  60 seconds today. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1307.3799999999999s)]
*  Obviously, that'll come off at some point. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1308.54s)]
*  But by the way, if you can do 60 seconds, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1309.86s)]
*  you can do two hours. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1311.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1312.58s)]
*  The problem that you have is, I mean, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1313.08s)]
*  we're talking about creating a movie, is making edits. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1314.74s)]
*  So I'm obviously haven't used Sora yet, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1318.54s)]
*  because it just came out today. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1320.26s)]
*  But I've used Dali, which is just their prompt image service. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1321.46s)]
*  And I was designing the label for, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1326.54s)]
*  or the bottle for the all in tequila for you guys. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1329.06s)]
*  And what I noticed is that it would spit out a bunch of ideas. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1332.58s)]
*  And then I would take one and then [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1336.82s)]
*  want to just make little changes. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1339.26s)]
*  And I would just say, OK, keep this, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1341.38s)]
*  but just change this one detail. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1343.34s)]
*  It would give me a completely new image. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1345.06s)]
*  So the AI doesn't realize the layers inherent [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1347.1799999999998s)]
*  in what it's producing. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1351.8999999999999s)]
*  Somehow, it takes this prompt and generates a response. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1353.54s)]
*  And if you give it that same prompt 100 times, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1357.82s)]
*  it'll give you 100 different answers. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1360.62s)]
*  And if you'd say, just modify this, this, or this, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1362.54s)]
*  it can't do it. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1364.98s)]
*  Can't reason. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1365.74s)]
*  It can't take criticism. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1366.86s)]
*  Well, it seems like on some level, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1367.9399999999998s)]
*  it's unaware of the output that it's created. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1369.6599999999999s)]
*  Again, a human creating this in Photoshop [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1371.84s)]
*  would have a lot of layers. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1374.8799999999999s)]
*  And every object in that image would have its own layer. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1376.36s)]
*  And you could have a layer for text [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1380.3999999999999s)]
*  and just quickly modify the text. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1381.9599999999998s)]
*  When I want to do something as simple as edit the text [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1384.24s)]
*  or change the font, again, it would give me [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1387.84s)]
*  a completely different image. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1389.6s)]
*  And I just wonder about these videos. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1391.84s)]
*  If you want to create a movie, I think [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1393.6s)]
*  you're probably going to be stuck with what they give you. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1395.8799999999999s)]
*  And then maybe you can import that at some point [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1399.72s)]
*  into an Unreal Engine and then do work from there. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1402.44s)]
*  The editing part is it doesn't exist yet. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1404.8s)]
*  When you do text, it's easy because you just [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1407.56s)]
*  cut and paste it into your Grammarly or your Notion [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1409.72s)]
*  or whatever you use. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1412.32s)]
*  And you start editing. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1413.2s)]
*  Here, there's no exporting, like you're saying, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1414.4s)]
*  to Final Cut Pro or something. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1416.64s)]
*  I bet that when they turn this into an API, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1419.0s)]
*  that when you're working in Unreal Engine, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1421.48s)]
*  if you're a VR designer or something like that [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1424.52s)]
*  or you're a filmmaker, you could probably [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1426.6000000000001s)]
*  just get started with a prompt. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1429.68s)]
*  And that could be hugely time-saving [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1431.8s)]
*  if they can make that integration work. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1435.3600000000001s)]
*  I think that's pretty interesting. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1438.52s)]
*  I looked at this a lot over the last year. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1440.0s)]
*  This was one of the biggest challenges [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1441.64s)]
*  is in order to have an interactive approach [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1443.24s)]
*  to video production or video game production, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1446.76s)]
*  you have to be able to say, we'll take that out, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1450.48s)]
*  put that in. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1452.4s)]
*  But like you said, the model doesn't [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1453.44s)]
*  distinguish the objects. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1455.28s)]
*  It doesn't distinguish each of those little flowers [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1457.4399999999998s)]
*  or each of those little cherry blossoms. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1460.0s)]
*  It doesn't even distinguish if there's two people walking [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1461.6s)]
*  down the road. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1463.76s)]
*  The model doesn't have this concept of objects [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1464.6799999999998s)]
*  when it renders. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1466.9199999999998s)]
*  And so the traditional model where [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1468.28s)]
*  you have objects in a 3D model that then get rendered [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1471.4799999999998s)]
*  into a video allows you to do those sorts of things. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1474.6399999999999s)]
*  So what may end up happening is a fusion. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1478.52s)]
*  And this is something we talked about with Stephen Wolfram [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1480.9199999999998s)]
*  and others, that there are these models that [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1483.3999999999999s)]
*  are called compute models that do deterministic compute tasks. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1485.28s)]
*  Then there are these AI trained models [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1491.0s)]
*  where we don't really have a sense of how they work. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1493.8799999999999s)]
*  But the fusion of the two will unlock a lot of opportunities. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1496.08s)]
*  And that's very likely the next generation of models [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1499.42s)]
*  is not just purely non-human intervene trained models, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1502.32s)]
*  but the integration of those models [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1505.92s)]
*  with these deterministic models, with these compute models. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1508.2s)]
*  And then you can start to do things like instead of saying, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1510.96s)]
*  render this whole scene, you're saying, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1513.66s)]
*  render all the objects that would go in the scene. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1516.1s)]
*  They get placed in an Unreal Engine. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1518.06s)]
*  And then the Unreal Engine outputs the video. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1519.98s)]
*  And so that integration work, I think, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1522.5s)]
*  is the next big phase in AI model development. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1524.5s)]
*  And that'll unlock insane shit. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1527.18s)]
*  Yeah, because right now you can't use this to create dialogue. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1529.98s)]
*  Like actors in a movie scene talking to each other [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1534.14s)]
*  and acting, especially like close-ups of those actors [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1536.98s)]
*  with their facial expressions. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1540.62s)]
*  I don't see any examples like that. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1542.66s)]
*  The way humans want to have a creative process, [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1544.46s)]
*  it doesn't work. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1546.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1547.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1547.5s)]
*  Yeah, it'll get there though. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1547.8600000000001s)]
*  And if you put something like this out there to the public [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1549.0600000000002s)]
*  and said it's $20 a month to do this or $50 a month, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1552.1000000000001s)]
*  you can have a lot of consumers who want to buy this product. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1556.26s)]
*  So when I see this, I think people [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1559.18s)]
*  are going to pay for this. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1560.6200000000001s)]
*  And then going back to NVIDIA or ARM, OK, more infrastructure. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1561.98s)]
*  To your point, Freeberg is like, what infrastructure [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1566.98s)]
*  do we need for everybody to have [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1569.62s)]
*  Pixar on their laptop or on their phone? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1571.2199999999998s)]
*  And people are willing to pay for these products. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1574.9799999999998s)]
*  I don't know if you guys saw this, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1577.3799999999999s)]
*  but there was another big breakthrough announced today [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1578.4199999999998s)]
*  with the new Gemini Pro 15. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1580.58s)]
*  Can you just pull up Sundar's announcement on it? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1582.9799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Sundar now has found the password to his Twitter handle. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1584.9799999999998s)]
*  He's tweeting. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1588.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1589.8999999999999s)]
*  The reason I want to talk about this, if you just scroll down. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1590.4199999999998s)]
*  So when you prompt an AI model, you [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1593.54s)]
*  put in a certain number of words into like an LLM model today. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1595.6999999999998s)]
*  And it spits words back out. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1599.14s)]
*  The more words you put into the model, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1601.42s)]
*  the more compute intensive or challenging [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1604.5s)]
*  it is to do the compute work needed to render the output. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1606.22s)]
*  So OpenAI, their GPT-4 turbo model, has 128,000 tokens, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1609.94s)]
*  which means about 128,000 words, can be fed into the model [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1616.8200000000002s)]
*  to get an answer back out. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1620.7s)]
*  So you could put like a whole essay or 100 pages of text, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1622.14s)]
*  and it will read a document for you. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1625.9s)]
*  You can get a whole book. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1627.6200000000001s)]
*  And it could give you a summary in a couple of seconds. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1628.62s)]
*  What Google just announced with Gemini 1.5 Pro [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1631.3s)]
*  is a 1 million token context window, up to 10 million token [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1633.78s)]
*  context window in total. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1638.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't know what's going on here, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1640.62s)]
*  because the problem is the way these models are kind [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1642.1799999999998s)]
*  of traditionally built is that that creates [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1645.6999999999998s)]
*  a non-linear scaling and compute needs [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1648.2199999999998s)]
*  to be able to increase that context window like that. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1650.6999999999998s)]
*  So there is some architectural work [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1653.58s)]
*  that's gone on to allow these models to scale up in a way [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1655.54s)]
*  that we did not think possible when these models first came [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1659.1s)]
*  out, which is crazy to think was only like 24 months ago [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1661.46s)]
*  that they started to get kind of looked at like this. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1664.3799999999999s)]
*  18 months maybe. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1665.98s)]
*  Yeah, and so there's two kind of things that are happening. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1667.3s)]
*  One is that these models are getting chopped up in a way [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1670.42s)]
*  that you can run small models in a highly trained way locally, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1672.8799999999999s)]
*  and you don't need a massive general purpose model. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1676.58s)]
*  And so that's going to make compute needs very small [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1679.02s)]
*  for very specific tasks. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1681.1s)]
*  And the other one is that there's other architecture that's [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1682.34s)]
*  happening in deploying the models that's [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1684.58s)]
*  allowing massive context windows like this. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1686.46s)]
*  So it totally changes how scalable [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1688.6999999999998s)]
*  they are with the same number of chips [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1690.26s)]
*  or the same amount of compute or the same amount of power. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1692.1399999999999s)]
*  So there are all these amazing Moore's law effects happening [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1694.5s)]
*  right now in AI technology development on the chip level, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1697.86s)]
*  on the architectural level, on how they're being built [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1701.46s)]
*  and how they're being deployed that completely changes [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1703.82s)]
*  the concept that I think most folks had when these first came [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1706.3s)]
*  out two years ago and the potential. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1708.46s)]
*  So I think sky's still the limit. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1710.4199999999998s)]
*  We don't really know how big this is going to get. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1711.9199999999998s)]
*  But all of these efficiency gains [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1714.42s)]
*  mean that we can do so much more with so much less. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1715.9s)]
*  And by the way, when you can do more with less, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1719.26s)]
*  it doesn't mean you need less chips. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1720.9s)]
*  It means you need a lot more chips. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1722.78s)]
*  Because the fact that you can do a lot more [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1724.94s)]
*  with much fewer chips means everyone's [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1726.7s)]
*  going to want to do it now. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1729.0600000000002s)]
*  More people can afford to do it. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1730.1000000000001s)]
*  So it unlocks the opportunity for compute. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1731.42s)]
*  And so it really starts to rationalize the Nvidia thesis [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1734.8400000000001s)]
*  that it could be worth $10 trillion potentially. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1738.54s)]
*  For people in the audience to understand [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1741.6200000000001s)]
*  what this context window means. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1743.3s)]
*  I'm sorry if I was too technical. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1744.78s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1745.8999999999999s)]
*  I always like to just give an example or two [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1747.18s)]
*  after you explain it. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1748.98s)]
*  The context window, for example, you [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1750.1s)]
*  could upload the transcript of this podcast. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1753.2s)]
*  And there were only certain services, like Claude maybe, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1755.74s)]
*  where you could put a PDF attachment. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1758.46s)]
*  Boom, you put it in there and say, hey, summarize this [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1760.02s)]
*  using your language model and using this content. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1761.94s)]
*  Now you could be able to say, hey, take me [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1764.5s)]
*  every MrBeast video. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1766.78s)]
*  Take the top 10,000 videos on YouTube. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1769.7s)]
*  Take the transcripts, summarize them for me. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1772.58s)]
*  Give some analysis on it. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1774.3s)]
*  And that was only available to developers [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1776.1799999999998s)]
*  prior to these large context windows being open. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1778.58s)]
*  And that's going to just open up a massive amount [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1782.78s)]
*  of application, right, Shima? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1786.4199999999998s)]
*  The results are actually not that much better. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1787.78s)]
*  There's these third party service benchmarks. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1789.6999999999998s)]
*  Lombard is probably the most often referred to. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1791.58s)]
*  But what you see, if you just look at, for example, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1793.62s)]
*  all the GPTs, even as they increase [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1796.08s)]
*  the number of parameters in a model, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1798.3799999999999s)]
*  the quality of that model doesn't necessarily increase [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1801.6599999999999s)]
*  with the rate of parameter increase. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1803.86s)]
*  So you have this thing of a little bit [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1805.5s)]
*  of diminishing return, which is more a problem [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1808.3799999999999s)]
*  of what we said before, which is, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1810.3s)]
*  eventually when you're scouring the open internet, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1812.4599999999998s)]
*  doesn't matter how fast or how big you scour [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1814.4599999999998s)]
*  the open internet, the open internet is a bounded space. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1817.26s)]
*  And so you get to the same answer. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1819.54s)]
*  So all of these things are, they're interesting [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1821.5s)]
*  marketing ware, but I would just encourage us all [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1825.4599999999998s)]
*  to keep in mind that the shift is not necessarily [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1829.98s)]
*  these kinds of things. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1834.38s)]
*  It's kind of like saying, you know, in a chip like, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1836.78s)]
*  oh, wow, we built this chip on three nanometer. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1838.58s)]
*  Okay, what does it mean? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1840.78s)]
*  Well, no, I think the piece, respectfully, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1842.1s)]
*  you might be missing here is like, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1843.78s)]
*  your proprietary data might not be in that language model. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1845.74s)]
*  So by having this context window and you can add something [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1850.54s)]
*  that you have on your hard drive. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1853.42s)]
*  That's not how it works. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1854.8600000000001s)]
*  So my point is the context window is not correlated [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1855.7s)]
*  to the quality of the model outputs. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1858.74s)]
*  Correct. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1860.78s)]
*  But consumers and business users haven't been able [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1861.6200000000001s)]
*  to put their data into the models [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1864.94s)]
*  because they're not indexing. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1866.58s)]
*  But that has nothing to do with the context window. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1867.42s)]
*  That existed when the context window was smaller. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1868.46s)]
*  But that's what you think you do things like RAG with. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1870.46s)]
*  Right, but most people don't have access to that. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1873.1s)]
*  This is like consumers can now just take something [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1875.22s)]
*  off their hard drives and put it up there. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1877.5s)]
*  I understand what I'm saying. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1878.34s)]
*  RAG is different than what this is. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1879.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1881.38s)]
*  Like this is, this, what you guys just spent all this time [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1882.22s)]
*  talking about is equivalent to saying, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1885.7s)]
*  I built this chip with on a seven nanometer process [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1887.7s)]
*  or a three nanometer process. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1890.82s)]
*  And what I'm saying is it is technically more burdensome [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1892.18s)]
*  as Friedberg said, it's technically much more sophisticated [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1896.06s)]
*  and complicated, but the translation to quality [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1899.66s)]
*  in the consumer is not what that means. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1905.5s)]
*  So a three nanometer chip is not two times better [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1909.3s)]
*  than a seven nanometer chip for the consumer. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1912.02s)]
*  Similarly, a context window that's five times bigger [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1914.46s)]
*  than the one before it doesn't make a model five times [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1918.54s)]
*  better to the consumer. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1921.22s)]
*  These are orthogonal ideas. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1922.3s)]
*  It's not to say that it isn't an important thing, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1923.98s)]
*  but I would say that it's a reminder for me [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1926.8600000000001s)]
*  that we're in the early phases where there's a lot of hay [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1929.22s)]
*  that people can make, but it's important to look [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1934.06s)]
*  at these third party benchmarks that try to sort through [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1937.94s)]
*  and sift through what matters and what doesn't matter. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1940.82s)]
*  And one of the interesting things [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1943.98s)]
*  that third party benchmark services have figured out [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1945.3s)]
*  is that irrespective of the exponential growth [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1949.22s)]
*  of these things, like parameter size, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1951.9399999999998s)]
*  quality is only growing linearly and now sublinearly. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1954.62s)]
*  So it's just an interesting point. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1959.6599999999999s)]
*  I understand your point now. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1960.78s)]
*  My point is, man, when you are a consumer of this, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1962.3s)]
*  and I've been talking to people trying to get their data [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1966.62s)]
*  into the context window to be able to ask a question, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1969.54s)]
*  or it's like, how do I put more in there? [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1972.7s)]
*  How do I put more in there? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1974.14s)]
*  And then these language models, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1975.74s)]
*  because of the copyright issues, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1977.74s)]
*  they're not able to upload Blade Runner and then say, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1980.22s)]
*  hey, make me something. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1984.06s)]
*  But I was able to, and just to give a very real example, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1984.98s)]
*  I did a podcast around the Ray Kroc movie, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1987.7s)]
*  the founder that we were referencing earlier. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1991.66s)]
*  I uploaded the screenplay, I found a PDF of the book, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1993.8600000000001s)]
*  and I found two other essays about Ray Kroc, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1997.06s)]
*  like HBS studies. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=1999.6200000000001s)]
*  And I said, give me like a timeline of it. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2001.18s)]
*  And I used something called Google Notebook, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2002.8600000000001s)]
*  which has a big context window, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2004.5s)]
*  and you can upload all this stuff. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2005.7s)]
*  And that's where I'm seeing consumers [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2007.38s)]
*  and what these things are capable of, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2009.9s)]
*  vis-a-vis the context window. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2011.7s)]
*  It just unleashes in people's minds [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2013.98s)]
*  so many applications that you can do. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2015.8600000000001s)]
*  There are two examples today that caught my eye [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2018.1000000000001s)]
*  that I think are worth bringing up. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2021.22s)]
*  The first one is from Metta. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2022.6200000000001s)]
*  Metta published this paper today, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2024.3000000000002s)]
*  which was like pretty crazy. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2025.7s)]
*  And essentially what they said is that, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2027.9s)]
*  for the realm of the software worker, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2030.26s)]
*  the software engineer, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2032.58s)]
*  what they basically built is this LLM tool [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2034.9s)]
*  that runs over Lama called TestGen. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2037.94s)]
*  And it essentially does automated unit testing [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2040.42s)]
*  to such a high degree of accuracy. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2043.7s)]
*  So, in the software development, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2045.82s)]
*  if you want to spit out a product, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2047.5s)]
*  you have to go through this thing [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2049.14s)]
*  where you have to functionally run unit tests [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2050.3s)]
*  and make sure the thing works as advertised. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2052.14s)]
*  And this paper essentially now allows you [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2055.3s)]
*  to traverse a code base, understand it, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2057.34s)]
*  generate these unit tests with high accuracy. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2059.82s)]
*  So, where is this valuable? [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2062.1400000000003s)]
*  Think of, remember the software bugs [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2064.3s)]
*  in like the Boeing 737 MAX issue, J-Cal, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2066.34s)]
*  where it turned out that it was just bad software? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2070.06s)]
*  Tools like this now will be able to run unit tests [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2073.1000000000004s)]
*  where you will not be able to get that plane out the door [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2076.2200000000003s)]
*  unless all of these functional unit tests [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2080.38s)]
*  not only have been written, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2083.3s)]
*  but run and have been passed successfully. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2084.42s)]
*  And it'll all be done by bots, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2086.82s)]
*  which means that you can't game that system. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2088.82s)]
*  So, that's something today that- [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2091.6600000000003s)]
*  And it's the last thing developers get to [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2093.54s)]
*  is writing the unit tests, right? [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2095.2200000000003s)]
*  It's always like- [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2096.38s)]
*  Which is why there's all kinds of bugs [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2097.2200000000003s)]
*  and security holes in code. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2098.6200000000003s)]
*  Now, I thought that that was a pretty large breakthrough, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2100.1800000000003s)]
*  and I think we're gonna go through a bunch of fine tunes [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2103.5s)]
*  on this that make it interesting. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2105.54s)]
*  And then, I saw this other thing [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2106.86s)]
*  which caught my eye even more, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2108.94s)]
*  which was this thing that Nat Friedman tweeted out, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2111.26s)]
*  which is this thing called magic.dev. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2113.82s)]
*  And what essentially it is, is like a coworker. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2115.82s)]
*  And what they are claiming, and I don't know if it's true, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2119.78s)]
*  is that now you can basically have this thing [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2123.5800000000004s)]
*  understand your style of code [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2127.38s)]
*  and actually be able to write code [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2130.2200000000003s)]
*  that is just as good as the way you write code. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2131.86s)]
*  So now, it's not a co-pilot, but effectively a coworker. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2134.34s)]
*  And this is the first real example of what I've seen [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2138.42s)]
*  of a claim that basically says, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2140.38s)]
*  hey, we can now be an add-on to your workforce. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2142.26s)]
*  And this to me is just so gargantuan, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2147.9s)]
*  because if you look at the amount of OPEX [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2151.1400000000003s)]
*  inside of any company that sits inside of R&D, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2155.42s)]
*  if you look at the amount of stock-based compensation, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2158.46s)]
*  if you replace humans with bots, which is what this is, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2161.9s)]
*  you're gonna crush those things. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2165.0600000000004s)]
*  SBC, at the limit, goes to zero [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2166.2200000000003s)]
*  because you don't have to give stock to a bot. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2169.1800000000003s)]
*  You don't have to give stock to people. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2171.6600000000003s)]
*  And OPEX gets shrunk [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2174.7000000000003s)]
*  because now you just pay a license to magic.dev [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2176.54s)]
*  or I don't know how they're gonna make money on this, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2178.94s)]
*  but really, really, really fascinating stuff. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2180.58s)]
*  It is a scary move. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2183.86s)]
*  But there was another open source project, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2185.42s)]
*  I think it's called Maggi, M-G-I-E. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2188.34s)]
*  I don't know if you saw that, Freberg, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2190.34s)]
*  but Apple has been working on an open source image project. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2192.34s)]
*  And so you're kind of gonna see, I think, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2196.7s)]
*  in iOS 18 or the next iPhone 16, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2198.82s)]
*  they're gonna have an image model baked onto that phone. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2202.38s)]
*  Where is Apple in all of this? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2204.86s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2206.7400000000002s)]
*  No, where are they? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2208.1400000000003s)]
*  They are building an image model [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2210.02s)]
*  and you're gonna be able to talk to your phone [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2212.7000000000003s)]
*  and say- They haven't announced anything. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2214.26s)]
*  I think you're gonna see a chip [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2215.6600000000003s)]
*  on the next set of mobile devices by Apple [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2217.7000000000003s)]
*  that will run models locally. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2221.42s)]
*  And so this goes back to the point about [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2223.9s)]
*  how the hell is the government gonna regulate AI models, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2225.86s)]
*  which is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2228.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, not the stupidest, it's probably top 20, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2230.54s)]
*  but the fact that they're gonna be able [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2234.22s)]
*  to be fully vertically designed, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2236.8599999999997s)]
*  that they can have the hardware and the software [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2239.5s)]
*  and integrate all the way through to the application layer, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2243.06s)]
*  they're gonna have, I would imagine, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2245.46s)]
*  incredible intuitive AI features [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2246.98s)]
*  built into all of their products that can run locally [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2249.5s)]
*  rather than all the other stuff that's going on [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2252.1s)]
*  where you've gotta make a request on the internet [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2254.2599999999998s)]
*  and get the results back over the internet. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2255.7799999999997s)]
*  It'll be pretty powerful. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2258.06s)]
*  But obviously no data, right? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2260.02s)]
*  We don't know what they're doing. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2261.46s)]
*  We're just speculating here. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2262.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, no, I mean, you have breadcrumbs. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2264.5s)]
*  And the breadcrumbs are, they have an image model [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2265.34s)]
*  and I just dropped it in the hugging face of it. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2267.5s)]
*  You can basically upload an image [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2269.58s)]
*  and just give it a text prompt of how to change the image. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2270.7400000000002s)]
*  So, if Nick were to use this, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2273.54s)]
*  he could upload a picture of you to him off and say, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2276.2400000000002s)]
*  give him five o'clock shadow, give him a mustache, whatever. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2279.02s)]
*  Nick, will you do that real quick while we're talking? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2282.1400000000003s)]
*  While you're doing that, can you bring up the video [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2284.7000000000003s)]
*  of the robot's life in a cyberpunk setting? [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2286.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's beautiful. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2290.54s)]
*  Is this a Sora rendering? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2291.38s)]
*  Yeah, this is Sora. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2292.54s)]
*  So beautiful, so detailed. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2293.9s)]
*  It's really cool. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2295.1s)]
*  So, but here's the limitation. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2295.94s)]
*  And this goes back to what me and Fiora [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2298.42s)]
*  were talking about earlier. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2299.7799999999997s)]
*  Okay, so you've got these people in the background. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2300.62s)]
*  Let's say that you're trying to make a movie. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2303.94s)]
*  Look at their feet, their feet are backwards, by the way. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2304.7799999999997s)]
*  You can see the human feet aren't correct. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2306.2599999999998s)]
*  Sort of like a volley problem. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2307.98s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, what's cool is that, okay, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2309.1s)]
*  so those cars aren't moving, they're static. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2311.2599999999998s)]
*  You've got some movement of these background people, right? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2313.46s)]
*  At least so they're kind of, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2317.34s)]
*  they're the extras in a movie. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2319.74s)]
*  But if you wanted to tell Sora, this is my guess, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2323.1400000000003s)]
*  that, okay, I want the people in the background [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2326.46s)]
*  to be doing this, it would render a whole different image. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2328.5s)]
*  Like your robot might change too, right? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2330.94s)]
*  Well, Sax, this is where your context window matters. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2333.6600000000003s)]
*  So if you repeat the statement, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2335.98s)]
*  instead of writing and then iterating, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2338.38s)]
*  if you just re-prompt it and your prompt got longer [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2341.1400000000003s)]
*  and longer and longer with the degrees of specificity [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2344.26s)]
*  you needed, that's the way you use these models today. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2346.6200000000003s)]
*  And to your point, what humans are looking for [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2349.98s)]
*  from a UX perspective is an iterative approach to rendering, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2351.9s)]
*  is an iterative approach, which isn't feasible in a world [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2355.94s)]
*  where the, this is all a matrix. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2359.98s)]
*  It's a three-dimensional matrix. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2362.38s)]
*  There's two dimensions of pixels, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2364.3s)]
*  and then the third dimension is the next image [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2366.02s)]
*  and the next image and the next image. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2367.34s)]
*  And so that matrix is re-rendered from scratch. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2369.02s)]
*  It doesn't have a concept of what are the objects [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2372.14s)]
*  that I'm rendering, it has a concept [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2375.94s)]
*  of a matrix of pixels. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2377.2200000000003s)]
*  And so it will re-render a matrix of pixels [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2378.78s)]
*  based on a redefined prompt. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2380.82s)]
*  But what you're describing would require [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2382.46s)]
*  a very different model architecture [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2384.38s)]
*  than the way all of these trained models operate today. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2385.9s)]
*  This is going to revolutionize pornography. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2387.98s)]
*  I think it's the first place. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2391.2200000000003s)]
*  No, no, I'm not saying it as a joke. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2392.38s)]
*  I think that's where you're going to see this first, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2393.6200000000003s)]
*  because then all these issues, potential issues [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2395.3s)]
*  of underage people or exploited folks, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2398.1800000000003s)]
*  it goes completely away. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2400.86s)]
*  You're the guy who's going to cut this. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2402.54s)]
*  No, and you know, it'll kill OnlyFans. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2404.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I was about to say, end of OnlyFans. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2408.46s)]
*  The point of gambling is where every revolution starts. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2409.3s)]
*  That's where the web started. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2411.86s)]
*  That's where the web started. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2414.54s)]
*  That's where payments got refined. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2415.6200000000003s)]
*  But I think that in pornography, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2417.1400000000003s)]
*  you're going to see this basically destroy pornography [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2420.02s)]
*  in OnlyFans. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2422.9s)]
*  I don't want to bring up something that's super offensive, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2423.7400000000002s)]
*  but there was a certain pop music star [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2427.1400000000003s)]
*  who had a bunch of images just a couple of weeks ago [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2429.7400000000002s)]
*  that were AI generated. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2433.38s)]
*  Yeah, AI fakes. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2434.6600000000003s)]
*  Deep fakes, right? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2435.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, there were a bunch of deep fakes of a pop star. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2436.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't actually highlight the person's name, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2438.54s)]
*  because then it just, I think, it sends more of it. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2440.78s)]
*  But X did a really good job of blocking all of them, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2442.66s)]
*  watermarking them and saying, you can't do this. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2446.46s)]
*  And so this is like a whole new world. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2448.82s)]
*  You can take any person on the planet [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2450.66s)]
*  and make porn out of them that is realistic. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2452.78s)]
*  Well, I don't mean that. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2455.1s)]
*  I just mean that you'll be able to make pornography [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2456.1s)]
*  in a way that is totally non-human involved, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2459.34s)]
*  which is generally better, I would say, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2463.54s)]
*  for all humans involved. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2465.3s)]
*  What's great about the deep fakes [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2467.9s)]
*  is that if you have a sex tape come out, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2469.3s)]
*  you can just say it's a deep fake. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2470.98s)]
*  Totally. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2472.1s)]
*  I was about to ask Chamath, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2472.94s)]
*  what is the prompt you're going to use [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2473.78s)]
*  to make love to yourself tonight [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2475.02s)]
*  with the new Sauron model? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2477.6600000000003s)]
*  Chamath embraces Chamath. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2480.06s)]
*  All I hope is I may just need to publish some data [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2482.42s)]
*  so that whatever deep fake gets some parts accurate. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2484.7400000000002s)]
*  This is Apple. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2487.26s)]
*  Oh, short Apple stock. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2488.3s)]
*  This is terrible. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2489.98s)]
*  It's not very good. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2490.82s)]
*  I thought we were good. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2491.6600000000003s)]
*  What is this model? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2492.5s)]
*  This is an Apple model. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2493.7000000000003s)]
*  It's called Maggi, M-G-I-E. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2494.6600000000003s)]
*  This is Apple's open source image model. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2497.18s)]
*  It's way behind. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2499.4199999999996s)]
*  This looks like GPT 0.1. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2500.2599999999998s)]
*  They got work to do, but it's open source. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2502.18s)]
*  It's gonna go faster. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2503.94s)]
*  It's very hard to make fine tune changes in these models [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2504.7799999999997s)]
*  or to get the result that you want, but that's fine. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2507.4199999999996s)]
*  This is V 0.9, so. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2509.2599999999998s)]
*  If you guys wanna see a great fine tune, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2512.58s)]
*  the Juggernaut XL fine tune, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2514.4199999999996s)]
*  I would just say try it. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2516.98s)]
*  It is a fine tune that does not allow bad looking people. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2518.14s)]
*  Bad looking people. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2523.2999999999997s)]
*  The whole concept is only beautiful people. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2524.46s)]
*  So it doesn't matter what your prompt is, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2528.06s)]
*  but these people come out looking [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2530.1s)]
*  like the most incredibly good looking people I've ever seen. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2530.94s)]
*  As if the standard wasn't already high enough [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2534.7s)]
*  with filters and everything else, but. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2537.58s)]
*  This is gonna be a revolution for independent film. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2539.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, this is obviously just tip of the iceberg, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2541.2599999999998s)]
*  but the problem with independent film right now [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2542.8599999999997s)]
*  is that the economic model literally doesn't work. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2544.96s)]
*  It's too expensive to make an independent movie [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2547.12s)]
*  relative to the return. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2550.2599999999998s)]
*  And so the independent movie business [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2553.9s)]
*  has almost dried up almost completely. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2555.66s)]
*  This is gonna revolutionize it [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2558.54s)]
*  because it'll bring the cost down close to zero. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2559.7s)]
*  Now I don't agree with Freeberg [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2562.46s)]
*  that everyone's gonna design their own entertainment [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2564.22s)]
*  because most people are lazy. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2566.02s)]
*  No, I'm not saying design. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2568.42s)]
*  Zach, the way you think about creative production processes [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2569.54s)]
*  is what's gonna change. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2572.5s)]
*  It's all gonna reduce down to sitting down. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2573.54s)]
*  And it's like when you ask your spouse or partner [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2576.02s)]
*  or whatever, what do you wanna watch tonight? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2578.02s)]
*  And they answer something. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2579.86s)]
*  That something will then be delivered to you instantly. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2581.38s)]
*  That's what's gonna be so powerful. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2584.5s)]
*  Well, you mean the AI's gonna create it on the spot for you? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2585.7000000000003s)]
*  It certainly will, but I think that there's a certain element [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2588.82s)]
*  of culture that gets integrated into personal AI. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2591.5s)]
*  I mean, I don't think we have time for this, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2595.82s)]
*  but I have like a whole philosophy. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2597.7200000000003s)]
*  People still want curation. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2599.26s)]
*  I mean, if you look at something like YouTube [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2600.54s)]
*  or really any user-generated content site, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2603.3s)]
*  there are roughly 100 times more people who are passive [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2605.6600000000003s)]
*  than people who are active and actually create stuff, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2609.38s)]
*  whatever the ratio is. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2611.82s)]
*  There's always a lot more passive viewers [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2612.98s)]
*  than there are creators. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2615.58s)]
*  So there's, I'd say most of the content will be created [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2617.58s)]
*  by people who actually care enough to do it. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2620.4s)]
*  Again, let's call it one or 2% of the population. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2622.42s)]
*  And then of those, 1% might actually be really good at it. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2625.06s)]
*  Yeah, but here's where Freeberg, I think, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2628.9s)]
*  has a really good point [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2630.9s)]
*  because I have been looking into this. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2632.1400000000003s)]
*  Imagine if you took the soprano, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2633.86s)]
*  something you and I love, Zach, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2637.1s)]
*  and you just said, hey, for each season, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2638.66s)]
*  give me 10 more minutes per episode [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2640.66s)]
*  and give me like two more characters or whatever. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2642.42s)]
*  Now, when you watch it the next time, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2645.46s)]
*  you can say, just fill it in. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2647.1s)]
*  I want every episode to be 90 minutes instead of 50 minutes. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2648.1s)]
*  Or I've been doing this thing with my daughters. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2651.46s)]
*  We're into Star Wars and the Clone Wars, et cetera. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2654.3799999999997s)]
*  People have been cutting shows like Andor or Rogue One, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2657.46s)]
*  Clone Wars, the prequels, et cetera, and the Bad Batch. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2663.3799999999997s)]
*  And they're putting in together timelines [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2666.86s)]
*  and they're making their new versions of it [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2668.78s)]
*  by super cutting the different series [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2671.6600000000003s)]
*  that are filling things in. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2674.04s)]
*  So you're gonna be able to say, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2675.2200000000003s)]
*  hey, tell me the whole Star Wars saga [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2676.82s)]
*  with a little more perspective from Obi-Wan [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2679.6s)]
*  or give me a little more perspective from this person. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2681.78s)]
*  And that's gonna just make these things, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2685.06s)]
*  like these franchises, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2686.82s)]
*  so much more watchable and deep and rich. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2687.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so this is my point, Zach, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2689.98s)]
*  is I don't think it's about [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2691.38s)]
*  ground up personal media creation. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2693.26s)]
*  I think that it's about the curation model changes. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2696.3s)]
*  The creator or the central creative force [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2700.02s)]
*  comes up with a genre with a bunch of characters, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2702.5800000000004s)]
*  like a Star Wars, and general arcs of stories. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2705.86s)]
*  And then you can go in and you can view it [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2709.78s)]
*  from any character's point of view. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2711.46s)]
*  Imagine watching the Star Wars movie [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2713.1800000000003s)]
*  from Darth Vader's point of view. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2715.04s)]
*  Imagine watching the Star Wars movie [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2716.9s)]
*  where you just stayed on Endor the whole time [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2719.78s)]
*  and you watched the news on the TV [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2722.86s)]
*  while you're hanging out the bar. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2725.1400000000003s)]
*  You with the EWOX? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2726.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2728.7s)]
*  So you're right that there's a great opportunity [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2730.02s)]
*  for some of these cinematic universes [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2731.82s)]
*  to kind of open up the creative assets [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2733.46s)]
*  and let the fan base do whatever they want with them [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2735.42s)]
*  or create these alternatives. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2737.94s)]
*  I still think that it's that 1% of the viewership [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2740.0s)]
*  that actually cares enough to do that. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2744.7s)]
*  And the reason is because that, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2747.18s)]
*  I think what you see with all these demos [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2749.7s)]
*  is that it's really easy to get the first 90%. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2752.5s)]
*  It's really hard to get the next 9% [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2756.18s)]
*  and then the final 1%. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2757.66s)]
*  To get to the level of, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2759.74s)]
*  Of course, yeah. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2761.5s)]
*  To get it dialed in to the point, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2762.42s)]
*  again, the first thing it gives you. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2764.42s)]
*  But the benefits could outweigh those costs. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2766.14s)]
*  And this is true in 3D video game playing. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2768.6s)]
*  I don't know if you play Fortnite, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2770.8199999999997s)]
*  but there's all sorts of stuff [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2772.36s)]
*  that you feel could be better. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2773.38s)]
*  But the overall value of that experience [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2774.7799999999997s)]
*  far outweighs the missing elements [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2777.18s)]
*  of it not being truly photorealistic. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2779.18s)]
*  And I think that's where this stuff goes. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2781.74s)]
*  It's Ski Week next week? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2783.58s)]
*  And I've done this for both of my older boys. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2786.2599999999998s)]
*  And I'm doing it now for my youngest boy [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2790.46s)]
*  who is four and a half, almost five. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2793.06s)]
*  We are going to watch this entire week [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2795.58s)]
*  all of the Star Wars movies. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2798.46s)]
*  Oh, fantastic. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2800.58s)]
*  And then I got a downloaded history. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2801.54s)]
*  Of feature movies. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2803.58s)]
*  All the movies. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2804.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2805.24s)]
*  From, and I got an order. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2806.08s)]
*  The order was not what I thought. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2806.94s)]
*  It's not as released, obviously. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2808.2599999999998s)]
*  No, you wanna do timelines. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2810.7599999999998s)]
*  So you wanna have the prequels? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2811.86s)]
*  I did that once and I will tell you [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2814.1s)]
*  it was super disappointing. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2815.86s)]
*  And Andor, Rogue One, the Star Wars, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2816.7s)]
*  the original sequel. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2819.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, you're saying this order is not good. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2820.62s)]
*  Here's what I was told. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2822.0s)]
*  This is what was the internet was the most popular. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2823.1s)]
*  You start with the Phantom Menace. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2825.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2828.22s)]
*  Then Attack of the Clones, [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2829.06s)]
*  then Revenge of the Sith. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2830.66s)]
*  Revenge of the Sith, yeah. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2831.5s)]
*  Then Solo is optional. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2832.54s)]
*  Optional, yeah. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2834.66s)]
*  Rogue One optional. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2835.58s)]
*  Yep. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2836.98s)]
*  Rogue One not optional. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2837.8199999999997s)]
*  Then Four, Five, and Six, obviously, and New Hope. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2838.66s)]
*  That's when your kids will lose their mind. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2841.02s)]
*  They'll be like, what is this? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2842.2599999999998s)]
*  Vampire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2844.1400000000003s)]
*  Four, Five, and Six are too slow for kids. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2845.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's the problem. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2847.38s)]
*  They like the prequels better. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2848.2200000000003s)]
*  Seven, The Force Awakens, and eight, The Last Jedi, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2849.06s)]
*  then nine, The Rise of Skywalker. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2851.38s)]
*  Skip the last three. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2853.42s)]
*  Yeah, the last three are garbage. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2854.78s)]
*  They fall asleep during Four, Five, Six. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2856.02s)]
*  Yeah. God, Four, Five, Six are the best. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2857.82s)]
*  The prequels are probably the most watchable. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2859.1400000000003s)]
*  They're very, in retrospect, they're great, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2861.6600000000003s)]
*  but there's also The Clone Wars, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2863.78s)]
*  which is absolutely fantastic. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2865.94s)]
*  I would sprinkle in some Clone Wars episodes. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2867.1000000000004s)]
*  Nat and my daughters, I'm forcing them to sit with us [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2869.02s)]
*  for this entire... [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2872.14s)]
*  Nat's gonna watch all this? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2873.2599999999998s)]
*  No, she's ready to shoot herself in the face. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2874.66s)]
*  Yeah, this is her worst nightmare. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2876.58s)]
*  She and my daughters are like... [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2877.8199999999997s)]
*  I put the over-under on Nat [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2878.9s)]
*  sticking through maybe 100 minutes of this. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2880.22s)]
*  And she's done. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2882.8599999999997s)]
*  She's done. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2883.9s)]
*  Amore, why do you poison the kids with this nerd stuff? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2884.74s)]
*  They're never going to get the girlfriend. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2888.42s)]
*  You told me it was a Frederico Fellini. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2890.2599999999998s)]
*  This is not a Fellini, this is a... [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2892.1s)]
*  How about that they watch something [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2894.1s)]
*  where the people make a love [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2895.7s)]
*  instead of the lights they would cut people's hand off. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2896.9s)]
*  Why are you watching this, exactly? [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2898.74s)]
*  It's a no, there's no love and a joy. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2900.58s)]
*  There's people with lightswords, it's no fun. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2903.14s)]
*  But to bridge the gap between your two visions, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2907.42s)]
*  Sax and Freeberg, sorry. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2909.94s)]
*  It's just Nat's voice is so great. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2912.98s)]
*  Chamath and I will talk when we talk to each other [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2916.1s)]
*  for literally 20 minutes as Nat. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2919.18s)]
*  We'll just have a conversation. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2921.62s)]
*  But it's a conversation we're having. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2923.22s)]
*  I don't know why Chamath, this deal has [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2925.14s)]
*  such a high interest rate on the convertible note. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2928.66s)]
*  Why would you do that to me? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2931.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm your friend. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2932.5s)]
*  Who's it going to be on the board? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2933.4199999999996s)]

*  I don't understand. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2937.9399999999996s)]
*  Well, it's an independency, Chamath. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2939.46s)]
*  You don't need to have a super smart person. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2941.7799999999997s)]
*  Just a different perspective. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2944.4199999999996s)]
*  This is the opposite of a white truffle. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2945.7799999999997s)]
*  The white truffle is delicious. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2947.5s)]
*  This is a product that smells like a poo. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2949.18s)]
*  But anyway, between Sax and Freeberg, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2952.98s)]
*  we're literally just talking. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2956.42s)]
*  Hey, when are you coming tonight, asshole? [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2958.86s)]

*  We need to- [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2961.3s)]
*  I'm going to try to make it by dinner. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2962.1400000000003s)]
*  I just have to give a keynote at a podcasting conference. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2963.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2966.38s)]
*  Wait, sorry, are you kidding me? [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2967.5400000000004s)]
*  No, I'm not kidding. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2969.0200000000004s)]
*  You guys banned me from having advertising here. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2970.38s)]

*  Perfect. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2989.22s)]
*  I will not do David Sacks time. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2990.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2991.94s)]
*  But between Freeberg and Dave, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2993.62s)]
*  Sax, you said it's like one or 2% of the audience. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2995.42s)]
*  For a show with a million viewers or 10 million viewers, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=2997.5s)]
*  that could be tens of thousands of lunatics. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3001.8199999999997s)]
*  And I don't know if you knew this, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3004.38s)]
*  but you remember when Luke Skywalker showed up, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3005.3399999999997s)]
*  spoiler alert, in The Mandalorian, [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3007.42s)]
*  everybody was like, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3009.22s)]
*  oh, his young face does not skip the uncanny valley. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3010.06s)]
*  This is why you gotta watch The Mandalorian. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3013.22s)]
*  So then some kid did his own AI re-rendering [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3015.22s)]
*  of Luke Skywalker after Return of the Jedi, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3019.3399999999997s)]
*  but after he defeats the emperor. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3022.3399999999997s)]
*  And they then hired that kid to work at Disney [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3026.22s)]
*  and LucasArts. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3029.8999999999996s)]
*  So what's happening is all these people [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3030.8199999999997s)]
*  who are making content for the Star Wars universe, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3032.62s)]
*  they are going to be the next generation of creators. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3035.3799999999997s)]
*  So between a Mr. Beast way over here and LucasArt, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3037.7s)]
*  there's going to be a new fill-in [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3042.14s)]
*  and it's going to be all these great one percenters [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3043.9s)]
*  making interesting with IP that's owned [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3046.7400000000002s)]
*  by other organizations. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3049.5s)]
*  I think it's a whole new paradigm for media and content. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3050.54s)]
*  It's going to be so different. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3053.7000000000003s)]
*  The automated stuff that's customized for you. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3054.54s)]
*  It's almost like what YouTube and Instagram did [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3056.6600000000003s)]
*  for user generated content. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3060.06s)]
*  There's going to be this whole new model [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3061.78s)]
*  of AI generated content. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3064.26s)]
*  The real winners are going to be the technology platforms [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3066.06s)]
*  that bring these tools in a simple intuitive way [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3069.6200000000003s)]
*  that to Sachs's point doesn't challenge the user to do work, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3072.14s)]
*  but makes their life feel easier and better [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3075.7s)]
*  and brings them a more rich experience [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3077.94s)]
*  than they're getting today from any other media source. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3079.7s)]
*  And that's going to be a game changer. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3081.5s)]
*  All right, lots going on in AI. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3082.7799999999997s)]
*  I thought I'd bring up a really interesting story [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3084.58s)]
*  that happened just around stock options and employees [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3087.74s)]
*  and advice you're going to get generally speaking, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3092.9s)]
*  just tons of chaos at the startup Bult. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3095.54s)]
*  If you don't remember, that's a one-click checkout startup. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3097.94s)]
*  It was founded by a guy named Ryan Breslow. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3100.46s)]
*  He's been on my other podcast, This Week in Startups. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3102.5s)]
*  He went viral in 2022 after he called YC and Shripe [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3105.46s)]
*  like mob bosses and had this whole conspiracy theory [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3108.5s)]
*  of how they were trying to kill his company. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3111.3s)]
*  Don't know if it's true or not, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3113.3s)]
*  but at its peak, Bult was valued at $11 billion a month [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3115.5s)]
*  and they're buying back shares at a $300 million valuation [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3118.7400000000002s)]
*  down 97%, yada yada. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3122.9s)]
*  What makes this interesting was that in 2022, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3125.1s)]
*  Breslow announced a new stock auction program [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3128.1s)]
*  for his employees on Twitter. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3131.02s)]
*  And he did this in a very bombastic lecturing kind of way [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3132.14s)]
*  to the entire industry saying that Bult would offer loans [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3135.06s)]
*  to any employee to exercise their options early. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3138.7s)]
*  We all know about these types of loans. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3141.1s)]
*  From their balance sheet? [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3142.82s)]
*  That is the idea here, yes. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3144.22s)]
*  And he called it the most employee-friendly plan possible [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3145.86s)]
*  and said that half of Bult's 600 plus employees [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3150.06s)]
*  took the deal. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3153.66s)]
*  He since deleted the entire thread, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3156.18s)]
*  but at the time, a lot of VCs who had been through this [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3158.82s)]
*  before explained to Ryan, this is a terrible idea. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3160.98s)]
*  Here's GGV's Jeff Richards, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3163.86s)]
*  for what it's worth almost every private company [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3165.9s)]
*  self-promoted did this in the 90s [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3167.78s)]
*  was an absolute disaster. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3169.02s)]
*  Employees spent years paying back loans [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3169.98s)]
*  for worth of stock tax bills [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3171.66s)]
*  from merely exercising, et cetera, yada yada. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3173.42s)]
*  And his now deleted tweet was, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3175.66s)]
*  over half our employees chose this, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3179.1s)]
*  plus I would strongly encourage my family [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3180.66s)]
*  and friends to choose this, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3182.1s)]
*  but VCs say it didn't work in the 90s, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3183.42s)]
*  so it's a disaster. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3185.1s)]
*  And so, when VC Twitter pumps the tweet, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3185.94s)]
*  this is why VC run companies are never able [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3188.26s)]
*  to make strides for employees. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3190.34s)]
*  Obviously, all those options at 11 billion [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3191.54s)]
*  are worthless now. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3194.14s)]
*  But sorry, they did this when they were worth 300 million? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3195.3s)]
*  11 billion. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3197.94s)]
*  And it was reported that at the same time [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3198.78s)]
*  in a new industry publication [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3201.34s)]
*  that Breslow was selling his shares in secondary. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3203.5s)]
*  Breslow confirmed with that newsletter [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3208.86s)]
*  that he had sold 10 million. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3211.14s)]
*  And sources, anonymous sources, yada yada, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3213.86s)]
*  take that forward, it's worth it, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3218.86s)]
*  said he didn't tell the team he was doing that. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3219.7s)]
*  Two investors also accused the company [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3223.14s)]
*  of misleading shareholders [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3224.66s)]
*  and raising capital on inflated metrics. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3225.8199999999997s)]
*  SEC investigated but did not recommend any action. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3228.62s)]
*  Sex, Jamath, I don't know if either want to take this. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3231.54s)]
*  This is really mechanical, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3234.22s)]
*  but it does speak to what happens when things implode. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3235.58s)]
*  Should employees be taking loans [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3238.74s)]
*  to buy these kinds of stocks? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3240.1s)]
*  At a minimum, hopefully these loans are non-recourse. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3241.4199999999996s)]
*  And at the maximum, if they were recourse, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3247.14s)]
*  but it looked like these guys were doing [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3249.9399999999996s)]
*  these kinds of shady things, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3251.5s)]
*  they have to kind of forgive the loans and eat it. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3252.58s)]
*  There's a reason why almost no one [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3254.62s)]
*  does these types of exercise loans anymore. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3255.8999999999996s)]
*  I mean, whoever the VC was who pushed back was right. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3258.02s)]
*  I mean, these things were common 20 something years ago. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3260.66s)]
*  People stopped doing it. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3263.62s)]
*  And the reason why is that, well, there are a couple [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3264.58s)]
*  of reasons. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3267.38s)]
*  So the mechanics of the loan are that the company [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3268.2200000000003s)]
*  loans you the money to pay down the exercise price, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3272.54s)]
*  the strike price for the options. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3275.6600000000003s)]
*  And then you're supposed to pay the company back [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3277.7400000000002s)]
*  at some future date, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3279.3s)]
*  basically when you can sell the shares. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3280.5s)]
*  And in effect, from the point of view [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3282.78s)]
*  of the balance sheet of the company, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3285.1800000000003s)]
*  this was cashless because it would loan the exercise price [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3286.5s)]
*  to the employee who would then exercise [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3290.34s)]
*  and pay that money back to the company. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3292.1400000000003s)]
*  So everyone's like, well, what's wrong with this? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3293.9s)]
*  This just seems like simple mechanics where no one loses. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3295.38s)]
*  The employee gets to start the clock on their shares [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3299.6600000000003s)]
*  for long-term capital gains. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3303.26s)]
*  That's why they would do it. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3304.42s)]
*  The problem is that what people discovered [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3305.82s)]
*  is that if the company didn't work out [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3308.9s)]
*  and those shares became worthless, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3311.58s)]
*  then the employee is still on the hook for the loan. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3313.58s)]
*  And if they don't pay the loan back, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3316.98s)]
*  then there's a loan forgiveness issue. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3320.34s)]
*  In other words, the forgiven amount of the loan [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3321.98s)]
*  or the defaulted amount of the loan [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3324.7s)]
*  becomes ordinary income. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3326.54s)]
*  And so what happens is you end up having to recognize [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3328.54s)]
*  as income the loan that you never pay back. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3330.74s)]
*  So you can lose. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3333.3799999999997s)]
*  Furthermore, if there's spread at the time that you exercise [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3334.7799999999997s)]
*  between the strike price and the fair market value [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3339.4199999999996s)]
*  of the shares, then although if it's the right kind of option, [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3342.06s)]
*  if it's an ISO, you can defer paying tax on that spread. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3345.8599999999997s)]
*  However, people got whammied by the AMT [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3348.9399999999996s)]
*  that that spread still counted for alternative minimum tax. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3351.82s)]
*  So there were a lot of people during the first dot-com bubble [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3355.42s)]
*  who exercised thinking they can't lose [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3358.1000000000004s)]
*  because the market was always up and to the right. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3360.7000000000003s)]
*  And then the company would go bust [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3363.46s)]
*  and they would get hit with a big AMT [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3365.38s)]
*  and then they would get hit with a loan forgiveness issue. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3367.1800000000003s)]
*  So that's why everyone stopped doing these things. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3369.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, really importantly, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3371.38s)]
*  getting taxed on that spread, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3373.0600000000004s)]
*  you owe that money no matter what. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3375.34s)]
*  No matter what. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3376.78s)]
*  No matter what. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3377.7000000000003s)]
*  The IRS demands that money [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3378.5800000000004s)]
*  and the California Franchise Tax Board demands that money. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3380.02s)]
*  So I just want to be very specific [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3383.38s)]
*  so people understand this. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3385.46s)]
*  If the value of your company's gone up to $2 a share [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3386.5s)]
*  as a private company and your options are 10 cents a share, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3391.62s)]
*  you pay 10 cents a share to get those shares, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3395.3s)]
*  you owe tax on the $1.90 difference. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3397.7400000000002s)]
*  And ultimately, if the company's now worth less than a dollar [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3401.3s)]
*  when you're finally able to sell or it shuts down, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3404.86s)]
*  you actually have money you have to pay to the IRS [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3408.26s)]
*  and Franchise Tax Board [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3410.5800000000004s)]
*  and you did not make enough money to cover the tax bill. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3411.42s)]
*  The way a lot of these companies do this [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3413.5s)]
*  is they do a cashless early exercise [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3414.78s)]
*  or cashless exercise loan. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3416.5800000000004s)]
*  You don't even have to put money up [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3418.46s)]
*  to pay the 10 cents a share. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3419.98s)]
*  The company is just covering it for you. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3421.1400000000003s)]
*  To Sachs's point, you end up getting taxed for that later [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3424.7400000000002s)]
*  if you don't pay it back. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3428.1000000000004s)]
*  So the whole thing creates a lot of tax obligations [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3428.94s)]
*  and it's a very complicated structure and system. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3432.46s)]
*  And the reason options exist [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3435.5400000000004s)]
*  is so that people could buy their options [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3437.62s)]
*  and not have to pay taxes at the time that they receive them. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3439.2999999999997s)]
*  Because if you just get shares in a company [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3442.34s)]
*  rather than options, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3444.38s)]
*  the value of those shares is your tax bill [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3446.34s)]
*  even if you can't sell the shares. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3448.94s)]
*  Well, it's income. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3450.38s)]
*  So it's income. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3451.22s)]
*  And so options were created as a way [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3452.14s)]
*  that you would have a strike [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3454.02s)]
*  and the strike was the fair market value. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3455.1s)]
*  So you're actually not getting any value today. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3457.66s)]
*  And so you can avoid the tax bill. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3460.2599999999998s)]
*  But now at least all these other tax loops. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3461.7s)]
*  It's way too complicated for Ryan to file employees [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3463.54s)]
*  is what it comes down to. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3466.06s)]
*  I saw this with senior executives [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3468.26s)]
*  trying to get the top five positions, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3469.66s)]
*  CFO or something. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3471.7000000000003s)]
*  And the whole thing is to reduce your tax bill [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3472.54s)]
*  from 50% to 20%. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3475.9s)]
*  And at the end of the day, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3478.06s)]
*  you open up all of these other problems [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3478.9s)]
*  if you try and do that. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3480.5s)]
*  Completely. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3481.46s)]
*  One of the stupidest things about the way this was used [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3482.3s)]
*  is that they would give the exercise loan [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3485.66s)]
*  to employees who are leaving the company. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3488.1s)]
*  Because they said that normally [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3490.42s)]
*  when you're a departing employee from a company, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3492.42s)]
*  you have three months to exercise your options [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3495.58s)]
*  or you lose them. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3498.18s)]
*  So they were saying that this would be a solution to that. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3499.86s)]
*  We're loaning the money to exercise. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3502.38s)]
*  All they're doing is creating a huge tax problem [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3504.34s)]
*  for that former employee. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3506.18s)]
*  And you're right, the average employee [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3507.7s)]
*  is not sophisticated enough to navigate all of these issues. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3509.22s)]
*  It's not clear also why you'd wanna create [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3514.14s)]
*  this complicated benefit for departing employees. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3516.22s)]
*  It seems like if you're gonna do this, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3519.62s)]
*  you would wanna do it for a key exec [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3521.5s)]
*  who's joining the company. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3523.66s)]
*  That's the only context in which I've seen it by the way. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3524.94s)]
*  Yeah, same. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3527.18s)]
*  So they were trying to solve a problem [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3528.14s)]
*  using this complicated device that really backfired. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3530.94s)]
*  But it's not even a problem [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3535.58s)]
*  that you should try and solve in that way. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3536.42s)]
*  I mean, there's a much simpler solution [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3537.82s)]
*  which is extend the period of time [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3539.14s)]
*  that employees have to exercise. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3540.86s)]
*  If you don't want them to lose their option [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3542.54s)]
*  if they don't exercise within three months, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3544.58s)]
*  give them 10 years. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3545.98s)]
*  And there are a bunch of companies that have done that [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3547.26s)]
*  where they give you a lot longer to exercise the option. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3550.1s)]
*  The trend I'm seeing with startups, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3552.82s)]
*  like early stage startups, seed stage startups, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3555.22s)]
*  which are really indicative [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3556.38s)]
*  of what startups will do later on. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3557.5s)]
*  Hiring people, cash basis, paying them hourly [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3559.66s)]
*  outside the United States, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3563.14s)]
*  not having to worry about stock options, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3564.5s)]
*  not having to worry about healthcare, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3566.8199999999997s)]
*  just finding a global workforce [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3569.86s)]
*  and using these third party tools. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3571.7799999999997s)]
*  There's a lot of third party tools to manage employees [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3573.42s)]
*  in Portugal or Manila or Canada or whatever, South America. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3576.02s)]
*  And they're just saying, you know what? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3579.98s)]
*  Stock options are gonna be for like an elite group, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3581.74s)]
*  the top 10% of the company. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3584.38s)]
*  And then we're gonna automate the rest of the jobs with AI [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3585.94s)]
*  and we're gonna outsource and have hourly workers [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3588.5s)]
*  or full-time contractors outside the United States. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3591.38s)]
*  It's the undeniable trend. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3594.22s)]
*  I think that's terrible. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3595.06s)]
*  Why? [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3597.06s)]
*  That's throwing the baby out with the bath water. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3597.9s)]
*  One of the most magical things about startups [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3599.3s)]
*  in Silicon Valley is that when it worked, everyone got rich. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3601.54s)]
*  I mean, you have the story of the Google chef [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3604.34s)]
*  who made a hundred million dollars [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3606.26s)]
*  or the secretary of Microsoft who got to retire. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3607.86s)]
*  Those are extreme examples. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3611.98s)]
*  The graffiti artist at Facebook. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3612.82s)]
*  The graffiti artist. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3614.42s)]
*  He didn't realize, what was his name, David? [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3615.46s)]
*  David Cho. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3616.82s)]
*  David Cho. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3617.6600000000003s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is that Silicon Valley [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3618.5s)]
*  had a share of the wealth mentality [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3619.9s)]
*  where the rank and file employees did participate [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3621.5s)]
*  in the ownership of the company and they got equity. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3624.46s)]
*  And it was highly motivating or it is highly motivating [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3626.6600000000003s)]
*  for not just like lower level employees, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3630.1400000000003s)]
*  but mid-level employees and senior employees [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3632.6600000000003s)]
*  to basically get equity in the company. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3634.94s)]
*  That's one of the things [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3636.78s)]
*  that makes Silicon Valley companies special [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3637.6600000000003s)]
*  or companies created outside Silicon Valley [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3640.7000000000003s)]
*  and they're not going to be able to do that [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3643.62s)]
*  using this Silicon Valley template. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3644.8199999999997s)]
*  The methodology. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3647.18s)]
*  Yeah, the philosophy. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3648.02s)]
*  So I think getting rid of options altogether [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3648.8599999999997s)]
*  is a terrible overreaction. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3650.2599999999998s)]
*  No, what they're doing is more like [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3651.4599999999996s)]
*  for the core team that's in Silicon Valley, options. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3653.3799999999997s)]
*  But then like for work that is not considered as essential, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3656.7s)]
*  just hiring people offshore who don't come [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3660.18s)]
*  with that expectation. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3662.9799999999996s)]
*  Well, trying to get those people then to work nights [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3663.8199999999997s)]
*  and weekends the way that you might be [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3665.14s)]
*  if you're the owner of the company. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3667.4199999999996s)]
*  They're not going to have an ownership mentality. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3668.62s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3670.3799999999997s)]
*  So I think that's the way that we're doing it. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3671.22s)]
*  And I think what people are starting to realize is like, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3672.8599999999997s)]
*  maybe there's, but there's remote workers. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3674.2999999999997s)]
*  A lot of people are doing nine to five work. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3676.7s)]
*  And maybe that like hard working culture [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3679.22s)]
*  just doesn't exist in Silicon Valley like it used to. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3681.5s)]
*  You may be able to find hard working entrepreneurial [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3683.98s)]
*  like folks that don't necessarily speak English [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3687.3799999999997s)]
*  that now with these AI tools [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3692.14s)]
*  basically become some of your best folks. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3694.62s)]
*  But there are many countries that don't value equity, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3696.62s)]
*  don't have an understanding of it. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3699.54s)]
*  And so to Jason's point, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3701.58s)]
*  it's almost more of a complication to try to give it. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3702.7400000000002s)]
*  So that may be the balancing thing, Sachs, that happens, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3705.98s)]
*  which is that all these tools actually allow somebody [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3709.1800000000003s)]
*  in some country that speaks some language [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3711.46s)]
*  that's not English, but who can be completely committed, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3715.46s)]
*  who becomes this linchpin of a business [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3718.26s)]
*  and gets paid an extremely great salary in American terms [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3721.26s)]
*  that makes them rich in their country, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3725.38s)]
*  get to the same place maybe. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3726.98s)]
*  Maybe, I don't know. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3728.42s)]
*  Infrastructure needs to be built for stock options [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3729.66s)]
*  in other countries, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3731.54s)]
*  because I don't know that that exists. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3732.38s)]
*  Or just pay people more cash [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3733.7s)]
*  because a lot of folks have different, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3734.94s)]
*  again, stock options make sense [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3736.3s)]
*  when you have a differential in taxation [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3738.1s)]
*  between stock equity and income. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3740.7s)]
*  But in other places where you have a flat tax [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3744.7400000000002s)]
*  or no income tax whatsoever, what's the difference? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3747.94s)]
*  Yeah, if you're in Dubai paying 1%, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3752.14s)]
*  like you could just ship it, right? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3753.9s)]
*  Ship it. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3756.54s)]
*  I mean, you can always go back to a model [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3757.42s)]
*  where people vest shares rather than vest options, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3760.42s)]
*  and those shares vest on a trigger of time [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3764.58s)]
*  and a liquidity event. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3767.2200000000003s)]
*  And that way they can't exercise, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3768.82s)]
*  or they won't get taxed prior [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3771.1s)]
*  to the liquidity event happening, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3772.54s)]
*  but then they will have to pay ordinary income tax rates [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3773.98s)]
*  on their shares. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3777.34s)]
*  Hold on, we're making it sound like exercising options [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3778.26s)]
*  is a bad thing. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3780.46s)]
*  It can be a very good thing. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3781.5s)]
*  I mean, if you're an early employee of a startup [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3782.78s)]
*  and the options are worth pennies [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3785.94s)]
*  and you can exercise for, I don't know, a few hundred dollars, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3790.26s)]
*  then that's a great tax benefit [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3793.42s)]
*  because you start the clock [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3795.26s)]
*  ticking on long-term capital gains treatment. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3796.2200000000003s)]
*  And when you sell those shares, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3798.3s)]
*  eventually if there's a liquidity event, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3799.54s)]
*  you get taxed at a capital gains rate, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3801.26s)]
*  not an ordinary income rate. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3804.34s)]
*  That's the tax benefit. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3805.94s)]
*  That's why people want to be able to exercise their options [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3807.14s)]
*  in the first place. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3810.2200000000003s)]
*  The problem is that as you join the company later and later, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3811.46s)]
*  the strike price of the options goes up. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3816.6600000000003s)]
*  And so therefore, if you want to exercise, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3818.7000000000003s)]
*  you're gonna have to write a pretty big check. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3821.82s)]
*  And so you're gonna take a meaningful risk. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3823.46s)]
*  Some people do that and that's fine. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3825.1000000000004s)]
*  The trouble comes in when you try to get cute [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3827.1400000000003s)]
*  and go around taking that risk by saying, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3830.0600000000004s)]
*  okay, well, the employee doesn't have to go out of pocket [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3832.0600000000004s)]
*  for their exercise price. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3834.7000000000003s)]
*  We're gonna loan them the money. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3836.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, they thought that they had figured out a way [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3837.7400000000002s)]
*  to avoid taking that risk, but as it turns out, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3839.82s)]
*  all you end up doing is potentially incurring AMT [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3842.7400000000002s)]
*  and it's a forgiveness issue. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3846.58s)]
*  So there's no way around the fact [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3848.06s)]
*  that if you want to exercise your options [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3849.58s)]
*  to get the potential tax benefit of a lower tax rate, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3851.62s)]
*  you have to also take the risk of losing the strike price, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3856.18s)]
*  that check that you write into the company, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3861.3399999999997s)]
*  that's a fair trade, right? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3863.7799999999997s)]
*  If you want the potential benefit, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3865.06s)]
*  you take the potential risk. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3866.9799999999996s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that you should never exercise. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3868.4599999999996s)]
*  There's a lot of cases, again, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3870.8199999999997s)]
*  I think if you're early in a company, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3872.4599999999996s)]
*  low hundreds of dollars, go for it. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3874.7400000000002s)]
*  There's all kinds of ways [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3877.02s)]
*  where when the basis is extremely low, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3878.78s)]
*  it's nominally not a lot of money. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3882.06s)]
*  So you can take the risk, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3884.2200000000003s)]
*  but when you start talking about tens of thousands [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3885.9s)]
*  or hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3887.98s)]
*  and then using loans and leverage and- [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3890.34s)]
*  You got the risk of ruin coming out. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3892.6600000000003s)]
*  Bad news bears all the way around. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3893.94s)]
*  No bueno. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3896.6600000000003s)]
*  All right, Sax, here's your red meat. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3897.5s)]
*  Did you see the poll about Biden's age [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3899.06s)]
*  and the unfavorable percentage of people [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3902.34s)]
*  who think he is too old? [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3905.98s)]
*  How can I not see that? [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3908.02s)]
*  I think the most important thing that we should talk about [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3909.3s)]
*  is that President Biden has decided [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3911.94s)]
*  to not go through a cognitive test [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3915.1000000000004s)]
*  as part of his annual physical. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3917.54s)]
*  It's the first time it's ever happened. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3918.98s)]
*  Joe Biden now, 81 years old, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3920.9s)]
*  82 at the start of his second term if he wins, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3922.54s)]
*  he'll be 86 at the end, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3924.94s)]
*  making him by far the oldest president ever. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3926.46s)]
*  Trump is 77, he would be 78 and a half [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3928.78s)]
*  when he gets his second term. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3933.1800000000003s)]
*  If he won, 82.5 at the end of his term. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3934.0200000000004s)]
*  Here's a histogram of age of presidents. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3937.6200000000003s)]
*  These are the oldest. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3939.94s)]
*  Just to give you a, [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3940.98s)]
*  everybody obviously refers to Reagan [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3942.1400000000003s)]
*  as the oldest president prior to this. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3944.0600000000004s)]
*  He was a spry 69 at the start of his presidency [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3946.6200000000003s)]
*  and by the end he was 77, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3950.86s)]
*  which is younger, obviously, than Biden and Trump today. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3952.5s)]
*  So Sax, thoughts? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3958.3s)]
*  Or Shemagh, thoughts? [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3960.82s)]
*  Let's just say that we've had a bunch of these issues [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3963.02s)]
*  over the last few years. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3964.5s)]
*  President Trump didn't disclose his tax returns. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3967.46s)]
*  Is that a huge issue? [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3971.66s)]
*  I think people made it to be a huge issue, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3973.8199999999997s)]
*  but it's more of an issue of judgment, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3975.7s)]
*  but I don't think it fundamentally compromises [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3977.9s)]
*  his ability to leave the country. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3980.58s)]
*  You had a different issue, not with the president, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3984.66s)]
*  but with the current defense secretary [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3986.42s)]
*  who had prostate cancer. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3989.86s)]
*  The disclosures were, let's just say, somewhat suboptimal. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3992.02s)]
*  He had a UTI, he got emergency admitted to the hospital. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=3998.26s)]
*  He just had another acute issue [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4003.1800000000003s)]
*  and those disclosures weren't good. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4005.6200000000003s)]
*  But you're talking about an acute kind of a thing [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4009.7400000000002s)]
*  where if you're incapacitated, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4012.1800000000003s)]
*  there's a chain of command that immediately kicks in. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4013.6200000000003s)]
*  Those are a class of issue that I think [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4017.22s)]
*  people can find things that are wrong with, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4021.18s)]
*  probably correlated to one's political affiliation. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4025.2599999999998s)]
*  The other side probably cares more [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4029.06s)]
*  than the side that the leader's on. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4030.5s)]
*  But I think this issue is a really big one. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4033.14s)]
*  And I posted this clip of KJP basically saying, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4035.4199999999996s)]
*  nothing to see here, move on. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4039.8199999999997s)]
*  And the first comment was Elon, which I think nailed it. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4041.62s)]
*  He said, a basic cognitive test should not be something [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4045.06s)]
*  that someone who controls nuclear strikes [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4048.62s)]
*  is allowed to skip. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4050.42s)]
*  And I think that that is part of the fundamental issue [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4052.34s)]
*  that I have with what they decided to do here, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4055.9s)]
*  which is that it just massively increases the risk [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4059.34s)]
*  that you could have somebody [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4062.1800000000003s)]
*  that was fundamentally unelected running [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4064.9s)]
*  and making decisions. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4067.86s)]
*  And I think that is a huge issue. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4068.82s)]
*  And it's an enormous reason why for me, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4071.78s)]
*  this was sort of the straw that broke the camel's back [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4075.18s)]
*  and why I just absolutely cannot vote for Biden anymore. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4077.86s)]
*  I was trying to find a lot of good reasons [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4081.18s)]
*  to support him, stability, normalcy, all of this stuff. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4086.62s)]
*  But this is not what stability looks like. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4093.06s)]
*  And I go again back to this very simple thing, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4096.34s)]
*  a cognitive test for somebody that can control the ability [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4099.3s)]
*  for us to go to war or for us to completely eviscerate [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4102.26s)]
*  entire populations through weaponry [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4106.860000000001s)]
*  that he and he alone controls [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4108.900000000001s)]
*  should be something that is just mandatory. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4112.22s)]
*  You can't skip it. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4114.54s)]
*  This is not a thing where it's a nice to have. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4115.74s)]
*  I think it's a must have. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4118.900000000001s)]
*  And in the absence of it, I think it compromises his ability [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4120.06s)]
*  to be a legitimate choice. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4123.18s)]
*  And we do have a minimum age, Saxe. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4124.46s)]
*  And what Shamath is saying is what the majority [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4126.62s)]
*  of Americans are saying. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4129.9800000000005s)]
*  In the ABC news ran a poll, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4130.98s)]
*  86% of Americans across both parties [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4133.66s)]
*  think Biden is too old to be president. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4136.98s)]
*  59% said both Biden and Trump were too old. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4139.0199999999995s)]
*  You said on a previous episode, Saxe, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4142.339999999999s)]
*  that you thought the public should decide [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4144.139999999999s)]
*  and that there doesn't need to be a cognitive test. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4146.139999999999s)]
*  Are you sticking with that? [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4147.9s)]
*  Or do you think you're gonna maybe move [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4148.74s)]
*  to Shamath's position and mine? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4150.339999999999s)]
*  Cognitive test should be mandatory to be president. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4152.179999999999s)]
*  Well, I think it's a tell [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4155.66s)]
*  that they won't take the cognitive test [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4157.0199999999995s)]
*  because they're worried that he might fail. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4159.299999999999s)]
*  Just like it was a tell [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4160.86s)]
*  that they refused to do the Super Bowl interview, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4162.66s)]
*  which the president always does. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4165.299999999999s)]
*  That's the most softball interview [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4166.54s)]
*  that Biden could possibly have. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4168.78s)]
*  And they refused to do it, obviously, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4171.42s)]
*  because his aides and advisors are nervous [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4172.94s)]
*  about how that might go. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4175.0199999999995s)]
*  We had the Her report come out [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4176.9s)]
*  where a special counsel investigated [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4179.0599999999995s)]
*  the classified documents case for Biden, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4181.66s)]
*  said that we can't prosecute this guy. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4183.9s)]
*  He'll be too sympathetic a defendant [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4185.86s)]
*  because he's manifestly senile. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4188.0599999999995s)]
*  And he'll come across as an old man [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4190.22s)]
*  who can't remember what happened. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4191.54s)]
*  So that's why they decided not to prosecute him. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4193.06s)]
*  The Babylon Bee had a hilarious headline or take on this, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4194.820000000001s)]
*  which was, man deemed too senile to stand for trial, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4197.780000000001s)]
*  still fit to run country. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4202.46s)]
*  That's the situation we're in. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4203.860000000001s)]
*  He can't stand for trial, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4205.3s)]
*  but he's still running in the country. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4206.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4207.860000000001s)]
*  And the thing that was most damning [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4208.780000000001s)]
*  about the Her report was not just what [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4211.700000000001s)]
*  the special counsel wrote, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4214.9800000000005s)]
*  but it was Biden's reaction to it. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4216.14s)]
*  Apparently he demanded that he wanted to go out [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4217.54s)]
*  and do a press conference that very day [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4220.66s)]
*  to refute the idea that his memory was bad [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4223.14s)]
*  or that he was senile. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4226.54s)]
*  And he then did this press conference [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4228.58s)]
*  and it completely backfired. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4231.02s)]
*  He came across as kind of an old man shaking his fists, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4232.42s)]
*  yelling, get off my lawn. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4236.62s)]
*  I mean, that was basically the vibe [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4237.98s)]
*  that he gave to the press. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4240.14s)]
*  And then the thing that he got wrong [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4241.86s)]
*  was he confused Egypt from Mexico [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4243.74s)]
*  in regards to the whole crisis in Gaza. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4246.14s)]
*  So it would have been one thing [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4249.900000000001s)]
*  if it was just her saying that Biden was senile, [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4251.660000000001s)]
*  but then Biden himself came out and seemed to confirm it [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4256.22s)]
*  by making these mistakes and gaffes. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4259.860000000001s)]
*  So they know they have a problem. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4262.26s)]
*  So to my original question, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4264.06s)]
*  would you be in favor and will you change your position here [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4265.54s)]
*  that we should have cognitive tests [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4268.9800000000005s)]
*  for the presidency of the United States? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4270.3s)]
*  Yes or no? [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4272.58s)]
*  I think that the real issue is that Biden [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4273.42s)]
*  would fail such a test. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4274.54s)]
*  I mean, that's the problem, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4276.18s)]
*  is that he is cognitively impaired. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4277.0199999999995s)]
*  And the thing to realize about these sorts of conditions [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4279.22s)]
*  is they're not static. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4281.42s)]
*  There's a trajectory to them. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4283.26s)]
*  So in the same way that Biden is manifestly worse [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4285.0199999999995s)]
*  than he was a year ago or three years ago. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4290.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, when he took office, he was obviously sharper. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4293.139999999999s)]
*  Whatever this condition is, it's gonna be worse. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4295.18s)]
*  Okay, I won't ask you a third time to answer the question, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4297.78s)]
*  but you were choosing not to answer the question. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4300.58s)]
*  So, Freeberry, what do you think? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4302.54s)]
*  When you say that, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4303.86s)]
*  should the president take a cognitive test? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4305.54s)]
*  Sure, he should take a cognitive test. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4307.0599999999995s)]
*  Should it be the law of the land? [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4308.82s)]
*  Just like we have a 35 year minimum age. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4310.9s)]
*  I'm just asking you to be specific. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4313.58s)]
*  You could make him take a cognitive test, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4314.94s)]
*  but the point is that let's say the doctor says, [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4316.5s)]
*  yeah, he's cognitively impaired. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4319.139999999999s)]
*  Is that gonna bar someone [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4320.94s)]
*  from running for office constitutionally? [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4322.62s)]
*  No, that's not gonna be part [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4324.7s)]
*  of the constitutional requirements. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4325.86s)]
*  You have to pass a constitutional amendment. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4328.259999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4330.86s)]
*  Is it a good idea for someone to take a cognitive test, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4331.74s)]
*  part of their physical to be president? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4334.139999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4335.58s)]
*  But is that gonna be a constitutional requirement? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4336.42s)]
*  No, you can't have some doctor say. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4338.0599999999995s)]
*  By the way, that's my whole point. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4340.139999999999s)]
*  You could take a physical, Bill Clinton did that, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4341.9s)]
*  and people used to joke about his cholesterol levels [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4344.86s)]
*  and he would go for a jog and stop at a McDonald's. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4347.0599999999995s)]
*  So I'm not saying by any means [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4349.86s)]
*  that the results should bar you from the ability to run. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4351.38s)]
*  It should still be up to the voters. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4354.9s)]
*  But just like we would make sure [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4356.58s)]
*  that acute or chronic health conditions [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4358.22s)]
*  were well understood, right? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4361.02s)]
*  The idea that this entire body of judgment, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4363.38s)]
*  which is around your brain, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4366.22s)]
*  around the judgment of the president of the United States, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4367.740000000001s)]
*  to basically say, no, we're good here, we can skip it. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4371.14s)]
*  I think that that's really dangerous. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4374.02s)]
*  And it's part and parcel of a systematic set [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4375.620000000001s)]
*  of behaving now by the Democratic Party, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4381.22s)]
*  which I think is really not where they want to be. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4383.5s)]
*  So the only person that's really stood up [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4386.3s)]
*  to all of this is Dean Phillips. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4388.18s)]
*  Yep. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4389.820000000001s)]
*  He is being prevented and railroaded [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4390.66s)]
*  from even being able to put that issue on the table [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4392.9s)]
*  so that the voters can decide. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4395.62s)]
*  My fundamental view is the voter should decide, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4396.94s)]
*  but all of these tests should be done. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4399.66s)]
*  And skipping them is a form of a tell, as David said. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4401.78s)]
*  And I think that this is the most important tell [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4405.62s)]
*  that we've been given about the amount [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4408.82s)]
*  of cognitive decline that he suffered. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4411.34s)]
*  And John Stewart, by the way, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4413.54s)]
*  had the funniest version of this. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4414.7s)]
*  John Stewart's essentially monologue was like, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4415.94s)]
*  hold on, everybody is out here giving soundbites [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4419.34s)]
*  that say he is a chess grandmaster in private, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4422.42s)]
*  but then he shows up in public [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4425.7s)]
*  and it looks like he can't even play checkers. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4427.02s)]
*  Yeah, Freberg, let me jump to you there. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4428.62s)]
*  You shared the clip with us. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4430.42s)]
*  What are your thoughts on this whole issue? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4431.5s)]
*  Cognitive tests. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4434.02s)]
*  I mean, I don't think a cognitive test should be the law [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4434.860000000001s)]
*  because you're starting to get into edge cases [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4437.860000000001s)]
*  where you'll create lots of different requirements. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4439.5s)]
*  Like what's the strategic test? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4441.42s)]
*  And what's the under pressure test? [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4443.54s)]
*  And there's obviously a lot of ways [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4445.58s)]
*  that folks can game and challenge [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4448.38s)]
*  and create new systems for a new criteria. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4450.18s)]
*  The system of democracy, however, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4453.900000000001s)]
*  is meant to solve these problems. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4455.86s)]
*  The system of democracy is meant to allow individual voters [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4457.58s)]
*  to say, we judge that someone is not equipped [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4460.66s)]
*  or prove us wrong, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4464.9800000000005s)]
*  which is what the voters are saying and doing right now [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4466.14s)]
*  based on the polling data. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4468.46s)]
*  The majority of voters in the United States are saying, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4470.18s)]
*  we do not think that this individual [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4473.3s)]
*  is equipped to be president. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4475.02s)]
*  Rather than respond to that with a cognitive test, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4477.14s)]
*  we are stuck with a single candidate. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4480.660000000001s)]
*  And I think it speaks more to the problem [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4483.22s)]
*  of the Democratic caucus [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4485.22s)]
*  and how the electoral system works in the United States today [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4487.14s)]
*  where the insiders get to decide [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4490.26s)]
*  who the nominee is for the party. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4492.660000000001s)]
*  And those insiders are self-dealt. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4495.02s)]
*  They are getting benefits by putting someone [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4497.34s)]
*  in the seat for next term [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4500.34s)]
*  because that person is in the seat this term [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4501.9400000000005s)]
*  and is approving things that they want this term. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4504.0199999999995s)]
*  And so it feels very corrupt [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4507.419999999999s)]
*  and it feels very unfair and very undemocratic. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4509.7s)]
*  I think it leads to either a sense [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4512.98s)]
*  that the individual voters rise up and say, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4515.259999999999s)]
*  we want a third party [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4517.86s)]
*  because the way that this two party system works [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4519.419999999999s)]
*  and the way that the caucus system works isn't fair. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4521.259999999999s)]
*  Or we end up seeing a really unfortunate outcome [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4524.66s)]
*  where you have a similar sort of like January 6th type event [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4528.299999999999s)]
*  where folks are just fed up with the whole system [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4530.86s)]
*  and don't trust it. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4532.7s)]
*  And if the citizens lose faith in democracy, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4534.82s)]
*  we're in peril. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4537.259999999999s)]
*  But as John Stewart said in his monologue, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4539.379999999999s)]
*  it is the responsibility of the citizens of this country [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4541.259999999999s)]
*  to step up and not lose faith, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4544.339999999999s)]
*  but to take action and to resolve to a solution. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4545.62s)]
*  We have the power, we have the authority as voters. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4548.179999999999s)]
*  And if enough of us get together [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4550.98s)]
*  and say there should be a third party [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4552.5s)]
*  or we do not want this individual to be the candidate, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4554.42s)]
*  something will change rather than just resolve [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4557.46s)]
*  to letting the insiders set the terms of the caucus. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4560.219999999999s)]
*  And that's just seeming more and more viable [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4563.14s)]
*  as we've talked about here. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4565.18s)]
*  People forget the case of Ross Perot getting 19%. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4566.740000000001s)]
*  RFK looking pretty favorable [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4571.9400000000005s)]
*  and the third party candidate something [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4574.700000000001s)]
*  I think the two parties dismiss all the time, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4577.780000000001s)]
*  but it is completely possible. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4579.620000000001s)]
*  So maybe this is the time [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4581.780000000001s)]
*  that this is the breakout season for it. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4584.22s)]
*  As Sax alluded to the HUR report also came out, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4586.18s)]
*  it was released. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4590.700000000001s)]
*  So Robert HUR Republican and Trump appointed AG [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4592.3s)]
*  declined to prosecute Biden [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4596.1s)]
*  because he feared they couldn't reach [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4598.900000000001s)]
*  the standard of reasonable doubt as Sax pointed out. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4600.58s)]
*  And I'll just quote from the report, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4604.22s)]
*  we conclude that the evidence does not establish [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4605.62s)]
*  Mr. Biden's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4607.38s)]
*  They also said he was an elderly man with a poor memory [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4609.62s)]
*  or that's how a jury would view Biden. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4615.74s)]
*  Democrats felt this was partisan obviously [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4617.54s)]
*  and then pointed out a bunch of times [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4620.74s)]
*  that Trump has misstated people's names or been confused. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4624.42s)]
*  Is there any correlation here [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4629.259999999999s)]
*  between the two candidates in your mind Chamath? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4631.62s)]
*  Is Trump right behind Biden in terms of this? [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4633.78s)]
*  And is he too old to run as well? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4636.42s)]
*  And do you think the gaffes that he's made are comparable? [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4637.82s)]
*  I think that he looks much younger and sprightlier [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4642.5s)]
*  than Biden does to be totally honest. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4647.9s)]
*  Yeah, and look at the schedule he maintains. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4650.54s)]
*  This is nothing like Biden's. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4652.98s)]
*  I mean, look, Democrats are trying to both sides the issue [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4654.58s)]
*  because it's their only choice. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4657.18s)]
*  They're stuck with a candidate who's an obvious decline. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4658.86s)]
*  And the problem for Democrats wasn't just the HUR report, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4662.34s)]
*  which like you said, J Cal, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4664.7s)]
*  they can dismiss as partisan because they control the media. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4666.02s)]
*  The problem is that Biden himself demanded to go out [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4668.78s)]
*  in front of a press conference to refute the HUR report. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4671.94s)]
*  And he ended up confirming it. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4674.7s)]
*  And the people of the United States [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4676.58s)]
*  can just look at Joe Biden. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4677.82s)]
*  And every time he talks, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4679.86s)]
*  no matter how much they try to hide him, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4681.42s)]
*  when he does speak, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4682.82s)]
*  the American people are left with the impression [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4684.14s)]
*  that this is somebody who's invisible to decline. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4686.26s)]
*  Trump, although he does misstate a word [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4688.74s)]
*  or two here and there, does not give that impression. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4691.06s)]
*  Trump maintains a vigorous schedule. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4693.94s)]
*  Not only is he running a presidential campaign, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4696.1s)]
*  he's battling, he's in court every other day, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4697.78s)]
*  fighting all this lawfare. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4700.5s)]
*  He is willing to give interviews. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4702.0199999999995s)]
*  In fact, he barely turns down a press interview. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4703.98s)]
*  And most importantly, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4707.14s)]
*  he's willing to do a hostile interview. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4707.9800000000005s)]
*  He's willing to step into the lion's den. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4709.38s)]
*  He's willing to go on CNN to those town halls [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4710.9400000000005s)]
*  and basically battle with these reporters. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4714.1s)]
*  Whereas Biden won't even sit down [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4717.3s)]
*  for the Super Bowl interview, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4719.62s)]
*  which is as much of a softball interview [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4720.62s)]
*  as you're ever gonna get. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4723.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, no, I mean, that's your best point. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4725.46s)]
*  I think who's trying to control the country, guys? [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4727.18s)]
*  Who does a two or three, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4729.1s)]
*  if you can't do a two or three hour interview, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4730.62s)]
*  I don't think you could be checking out. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4733.06s)]
*  J Cal, who do you think is gonna run the country [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4733.900000000001s)]
*  in the second term if Biden were to win? [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4735.5s)]
*  You know, that is the question. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4737.82s)]
*  You think it's Biden? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4739.14s)]
*  No, the staff runs it. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4740.82s)]
*  Listen, this will be a regent president [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4741.9800000000005s)]
*  where the presidency becomes an office instead of a person [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4745.38s)]
*  and it's run by powerful ministers, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4748.58s)]
*  like in some sort of European system. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4751.58s)]
*  That's what we'll get. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4753.9s)]
*  Or happened under Reagan. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4754.9s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is, look. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4756.1s)]
*  Or Sachs has happened under Reagan. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4757.7s)]
*  You can say it. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4759.78s)]
*  Only in the last couple of years of Reagan. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4760.62s)]
*  This is exactly what happened in Reagan. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4761.94s)]
*  The senility start to, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4763.38s)]
*  or not senility, he had Alzheimer's [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4764.54s)]
*  and it really, I think, started to become a factor [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4765.98s)]
*  in the last couple of years. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4769.22s)]
*  It was the last two years. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4770.54s)]
*  But the first six years were very strong. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4772.18s)]
*  25% of his presidency, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4774.22s)]
*  who was running the country is the question, yeah. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4775.9s)]
*  It's a valid question. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4778.34s)]
*  Do you think there's a difference, J Cal, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4779.18s)]
*  between 25% and 50%? [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4780.62s)]
*  No, no. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4782.98s)]
*  I think it's like we only have, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4783.82s)]
*  I'm just looking for other corollaries [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4785.34s)]
*  where this happened and what happened. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4786.74s)]
*  Who is? [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4788.66s)]
*  Well, no, I think this isn't a corollary exactly [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4789.5s)]
*  because when he ran, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4791.86s)]
*  when Reagan ran for a second term, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4793.0199999999995s)]
*  he was cognitively sharp. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4795.339999999999s)]
*  It was true that he was diagnosed [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4797.219999999999s)]
*  with early onset Alzheimer's [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4799.299999999999s)]
*  in the second year of his second term. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4800.82s)]
*  And then that was not properly disclosed to Americans. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4803.339999999999s)]
*  That was just, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4805.78s)]
*  it was just the beginning in the last two years. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4806.62s)]
*  If you look at the 1984 campaign, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4808.259999999999s)]
*  the Morning in America campaign, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4811.0599999999995s)]
*  Reagan still did debates. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4812.98s)]
*  He was still sharp on his feet. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4814.66s)]
*  He was debating Mondale, remember? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4816.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4818.299999999999s)]
*  He gave speeches all the time. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4819.259999999999s)]
*  He maintained a vigorous schedule. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4821.78s)]
*  There was no evidence of there being a problem. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4823.18s)]
*  My only point here, Chamath, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4825.02s)]
*  is like does the public has a right to know [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4826.06s)]
*  when these things happen? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4828.18s)]
*  And this seems to have happened [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4829.18s)]
*  a couple of times in history. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4830.42s)]
*  Well, so I would take Friedberg's side. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4831.82s)]
*  I'm not sure that the public, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4833.38s)]
*  you could say irrespective of whether [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4835.1s)]
*  the public has a right to know, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4836.9800000000005s)]
*  the public has a right to judge. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4838.66s)]
*  And I think in order to judge, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4841.14s)]
*  you have to make yourself available [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4843.18s)]
*  so that you can actually see it in front of your own eyes [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4844.78s)]
*  or hear it or listen to it or watch it or what have you. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4847.1s)]
*  And that's the second problem [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4850.26s)]
*  that I think we're starting to see, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4851.62s)]
*  which is it is so control [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4852.9800000000005s)]
*  how we get to interact with our leader. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4857.820000000001s)]
*  And I think that should give people some pause [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4861.66s)]
*  so that they ask themselves, why would this happen? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4864.18s)]
*  And I think that that's worth internalizing. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4869.66s)]
*  Friedberg, would you vote for a presidential candidate [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4872.62s)]
*  who does not debate or who does not subject himself [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4876.14s)]
*  to serious strenuous confrontational adversarial interviews? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4880.14s)]
*  Those two things. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4884.66s)]
*  Are those two things a requirement [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4885.5s)]
*  for you to vote for somebody? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4886.62s)]
*  I don't know how much that matters anymore. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4889.58s)]
*  The problem with the two party system [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4891.14s)]
*  is you vote for your party. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4892.62s)]
*  No, I know, but to you. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4894.14s)]
*  If like a Trump, a Biden, they just refuse to do it. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4896.3s)]
*  Cause we're getting to the point [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4898.9400000000005s)]
*  where maybe they're just gonna refuse to actually, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4900.06s)]
*  Biden or Trump, Trump has refused to do any debates. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4902.02s)]
*  So maybe they're just both gonna refuse to debate. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4904.900000000001s)]
*  Would you vote for a candidate if they refuse to debate? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4907.3s)]
*  It's my question to you, Friedberg. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4910.42s)]
*  I mean, I'm just in a very different mindset on this stuff. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4914.58s)]
*  I'm not excited to vote for a candidate [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4916.54s)]
*  that's not making their priority [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4919.18s)]
*  to fix the fiscal problem of the US. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4921.54s)]
*  All right, you're back to that topic. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4924.3s)]
*  It's not that topic. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4926.38s)]
*  It's like, for me, it's like, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4927.22s)]
*  there's a car driving towards a wall [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4928.34s)]
*  and you've got your foot on the gas pedal. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4930.78s)]
*  It's like, which guy do you wanna keep the foot [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4932.62s)]
*  on the gas pedal? [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4934.02s)]
*  Like, I don't care. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4934.860000000001s)]
*  We gotta take the foot off the gas pedal. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4937.139999999999s)]
*  That's the point. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4938.66s)]
*  You perceive there's a difference [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4939.5s)]
*  between the two in spending. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4940.34s)]
*  You're talking, okay, so you're voting [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4941.58s)]
*  for a third party candidate that would lean towards. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4944.26s)]
*  Chamath, would you vote for somebody who- [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4946.22s)]
*  Third party candidate can't win in the system. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4947.78s)]
*  Well, I mean, they can't until they can, right? [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4949.86s)]
*  Until they do. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4952.099999999999s)]
*  So we'll see. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4952.94s)]
*  Chamath, would you vote for a candidate [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4954.34s)]
*  who didn't debate or subject themselves [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4958.3s)]
*  to a rigorous adversarial interview? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4960.34s)]
*  Not unless I wanted to shadow government. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4963.46s)]
*  Okay, Sachs, same question to you. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4965.98s)]
*  Jason, you're acting as if we need to have [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4967.78s)]
*  all of these tests because we don't know [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4971.099999999999s)]
*  whether Biden has a cognitive problem or not. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4973.459999999999s)]
*  We know. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4975.82s)]
*  Well, I was including Trump in this. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4976.66s)]
*  I'm including Trump in this, like the debate issue. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4977.48s)]
*  Well, I think we also know about Trump. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4978.82s)]
*  Trump maintains a vigorous enough schedule. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4980.339999999999s)]
*  He takes enough difficult interviews. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4982.099999999999s)]
*  He does enough speeches. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4984.219999999999s)]
*  What about the debate part? [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4985.62s)]
*  That's the one I'm curious. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4986.66s)]
*  If he refuses to debate, would you still be willing [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4987.9s)]
*  to vote for him, you know, or any candidate? [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4991.0599999999995s)]
*  You're acting like we need to judge this question [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4993.139999999999s)]
*  based on proxies for the real issue, [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4996.74s)]
*  when the real issue is that we know one of these candidates [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=4998.0199999999995s)]
*  has basically dementia. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5001.339999999999s)]
*  He's invisible decline. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5003.88s)]
*  I'm not asking you this about Biden. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5005.48s)]
*  I'm asking you in general, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5006.86s)]
*  because we're talking about norms. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5008.74s)]
*  One of the norms of, you know, releasing your taxes. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5010.259999999999s)]
*  I'm not asking you about Biden. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5012.78s)]
*  I'm asking you about presidential norms. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5013.62s)]
*  I think you're changing the subject [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5015.46s)]
*  from the core substantive issue. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5016.299999999999s)]
*  We have already all agreed that Biden [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5017.42s)]
*  is in cognitive decline. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5019.82s)]
*  I'm asking you another question. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5021.179999999999s)]
*  I'm opening up the aperture as the moderator here, [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5022.38s)]
*  and I'm asking you to address another question. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5024.66s)]
*  I think candidates should debate, period. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5026.5s)]
*  Okay. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5028.34s)]
*  That's what I'm asking. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5029.18s)]
*  I don't know why you're going back [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5030.0199999999995s)]
*  and telling me what I think. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5031.099999999999s)]
*  Because I think that the tactic of Democrats, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5032.22s)]
*  the mainstream media right now is that they can't, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5034.78s)]
*  there's no way for them to paper over or deny [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5038.18s)]
*  the visible reality of Biden's decline. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5040.58s)]
*  So they're trying to muddy up the waters. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5042.82s)]
*  They're trying to claim, well, Trump is old too, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5045.16s)]
*  or that Trump refused to debate too. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5047.78s)]
*  They're trying to both sides of the issue. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5050.86s)]
*  I think we all know that Biden has a problem [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5052.52s)]
*  that Trump does not have. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5055.160000000001s)]
*  Now, I think that Chamath is also right [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5057.6s)]
*  that there's a lot of Democrats [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5059.92s)]
*  who are comfortable voting for a shadow government. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5061.84s)]
*  They're fine with the presidency [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5063.9400000000005s)]
*  being a figurehead or a rubber stamp. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5066.4800000000005s)]
*  And I think the reason why they're fine with it [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5068.72s)]
*  is because Democrats basically control [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5070.56s)]
*  most of our ruling institutions, really all of them. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5072.400000000001s)]
*  I don't think you can name one major institution [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5074.76s)]
*  run by Republicans. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5077.040000000001s)]
*  And they don't need a president to do anything [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5078.4400000000005s)]
*  other than be a rubber stamp. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5081.76s)]
*  Republicans are looking for something different. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5083.360000000001s)]
*  Republicans need a president who's willing to push back [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5085.12s)]
*  on the permanent bureaucracy in Washington, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5088.08s)]
*  push back on the deep state [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5090.26s)]
*  or the state department creating new wars. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5093.360000000001s)]
*  They want someone to push back on Wall Street. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5095.360000000001s)]
*  They want someone to push back on all these institutions. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5098.04s)]
*  Republicans are looking for a tribune of the plebs, [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5100.6s)]
*  basically, to push back on this senatorial class [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5104.280000000001s)]
*  that runs Washington for their own benefit. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5108.4400000000005s)]
*  Democrats are different. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5110.52s)]
*  Democrats are the ruling elite, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5111.36s)]
*  and they're fine with the president [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5113.679999999999s)]
*  basically just being a figurehead [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5117.16s)]
*  who will sign their legislation [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5119.2s)]
*  or veto bills they don't like. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5120.719999999999s)]
*  Does he drop out Chamath at this point? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5123.28s)]
*  Is this the moment we're gonna look back on and say, [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5124.88s)]
*  this is the peak when that 86% poll comes out [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5127.08s)]
*  and all this negative press? [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5130.16s)]
*  Do you think Biden is, there's an exit ramp here? [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5131.16s)]
*  And do you think there'll be a different candidate [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5134.04s)]
*  fielded by the Democrats? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5135.679999999999s)]
*  No, this was their way of saying we're going for it. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5138.86s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5142.5s)]
*  Friber, you have any thoughts on that? [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5143.54s)]
*  You think they'll make a switch? [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5144.54s)]
*  On Biden? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5146.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5147.179999999999s)]
*  I think there's a chance. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5148.0199999999995s)]
*  I think there's a chance. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5148.86s)]
*  Last week, I had a few conversations [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5149.7s)]
*  that led me to think that there are [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5150.98s)]
*  not super influential people in the party, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5152.58s)]
*  but people that are in the party [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5154.5s)]
*  that have connections to people of influence in the party. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5156.58s)]
*  I'd love to hear Chamath's conversations [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5159.9s)]
*  he may have had around this stuff too. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5163.5s)]
*  People are not happy in the party. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5165.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5168.3s)]
*  They're very much unhappy [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5169.14s)]
*  and everyone would love to see someone else. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5171.18s)]
*  Now the assumption is Gavin is gonna be shoved in that seat [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5173.3s)]
*  and that's also a losing proposition. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5177.14s)]
*  So if you shove Gavin in the seat, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5178.78s)]
*  you're in a worse place than you are with Biden in the seat [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5180.02s)]
*  with respect to your shot at winning. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5182.56s)]
*  And it's a little late now, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5185.06s)]
*  but I still think that there's a chance. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5186.78s)]
*  Sax, what do you think? [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5188.44s)]
*  Biden drops out? [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5189.7s)]
*  First of all, the only reason these people are unhappy [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5190.54s)]
*  is because they think that Biden's problems [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5192.3s)]
*  have become so manifest that it might cost them the election. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5194.26s)]
*  That's what they're worried about. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5196.7s)]
*  They don't care about the fact [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5198.02s)]
*  that the Biden presidency will be run by staffers. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5199.9400000000005s)]
*  As long as those staffers will basically do what they want, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5203.04s)]
*  sign their legislation or veto the- [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5206.3s)]
*  Will he drop out is the question we're asking you. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5208.1s)]
*  Will he drop out? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5209.820000000001s)]
*  No, he's already said he won't. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5210.66s)]
*  Look, the problem that people in the Democratic party have [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5212.06s)]
*  who have this concern about Biden losing the election [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5215.860000000001s)]
*  because of this cognitive issue [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5218.9400000000005s)]
*  is that there is no mechanism to replace a candidate [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5221.46s)]
*  who has won all the necessary primary votes [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5224.78s)]
*  against his will. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5228.5s)]
*  Biden has said he's gonna be the nominee. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5230.2s)]
*  He has no desire to drop out. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5231.66s)]
*  So unless he changes his mind or there's some act of God, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5233.74s)]
*  he's gonna be the nominee. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5237.02s)]
*  The time for Democrats to make this change was a year ago. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5238.68s)]
*  It required mounting a primary challenge to Biden [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5241.58s)]
*  the way that Dean Phillips has done. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5246.1s)]
*  The problem is that the Democratic party elders [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5247.9400000000005s)]
*  and the powerful people in the party [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5250.62s)]
*  said we're going with Biden. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5251.66s)]
*  And so no one wanted to run against him. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5253.22s)]
*  And they basically set up the primary calendar [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5255.18s)]
*  so that Biden would win and he is gonna win. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5259.12s)]
*  He'll have all the primary votes he needs locked up [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5260.9s)]
*  by the end of March. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5263.74s)]
*  And Dean Phillips is not gonna be able to basically stop him. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5265.26s)]
*  So there is no mechanism to remove Biden. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5268.82s)]
*  He's gonna be the candidate, barring act of God, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5270.92s)]
*  unless he can be persuaded to step down. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5274.5s)]
*  So it's not gonna happen. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5277.28s)]
*  What do you think about this new third party effort in DC? [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5278.7s)]
*  No labels, have you heard about it? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5282.7s)]
*  Have you been pitched it? [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5283.92s)]
*  I've heard of it, I haven't been pitched it. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5284.78s)]
*  Chamath, have you been pitched it? [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5287.139999999999s)]
*  I hosted a dinner at my house with some folks about it. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5288.38s)]
*  And? [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5292.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think like it could be interesting. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5292.86s)]
*  I think that the- [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5295.38s)]
*  Is there room for a third party in the country you think? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5296.54s)]
*  Yes, and I think that there is a very reasonable chance [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5298.72s)]
*  and I would put reasonable somewhere between 30 and 50. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5302.9s)]
*  50% that this third party gets created [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5309.22s)]
*  after the presidential election. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5313.58s)]
*  And that is the, one of the very likely outcomes [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5316.3s)]
*  of RFKs candidacy. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5320.26s)]
*  Because it is an infrastructure that will have [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5323.099999999999s)]
*  gotten on presidential ballots in 50 states. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5327.62s)]
*  And it's an infrastructure that if people are willing [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5331.0s)]
*  to fund specifically no labels and other people, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5333.099999999999s)]
*  I think the artifact could be a third party. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5336.0s)]
*  And if RFK can get 30 plus percent support, [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5339.58s)]
*  which in some states I think he will, [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5343.8s)]
*  I think that there's a decent chance. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5346.660000000001s)]
*  That would be an enormous outcome. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5348.88s)]
*  Obviously the most disruptive outcome for RFK [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5350.400000000001s)]
*  would be that he won the presidency. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5352.4800000000005s)]
*  But I'm just saying that a very powerful outcome [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5353.88s)]
*  that has huge longitudinal benefits to America [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5357.68s)]
*  would be that his candidacy essentially [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5361.08s)]
*  is the founding story of a third party. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5363.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5367.280000000001s)]
*  And that was the shame of what happened with Perot. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5369.160000000001s)]
*  I think that there was a chance that Perot [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5371.12s)]
*  could have done that and he must have been [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5372.4800000000005s)]
*  under just an enormous amount of pressure. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5374.200000000001s)]
*  I can't even imagine what he must have dealt with. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5376.38s)]
*  But that could have been the artifact back then, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5379.76s)]
*  but it definitely can be the artifact today. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5381.400000000001s)]
*  So we'll see. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5384.0s)]
*  They haven't announced either. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5386.52s)]
*  And there's no timeline for them announcing. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5388.04s)]
*  They've asked to come on this program many times [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5390.240000000001s)]
*  to just talk about the concept. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5392.240000000001s)]
*  I think like they wanna have like the executive director on. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5394.360000000001s)]
*  No labels? [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5397.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they've asked over the years. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5398.96s)]
*  I don't love, yeah. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5400.799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I just don't love that. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5401.639999999999s)]
*  And I was like, well, maybe when you pick a candidate, [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5402.48s)]
*  that would be a better time than just talking about it [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5403.32s)]
*  in the abstract. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5405.639999999999s)]
*  I think it's a great idea. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5407.48s)]
*  I think that's what Americans want. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5408.5199999999995s)]
*  So maybe we'll get to the- [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5409.92s)]
*  Guys, the election's in nine months. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5411.32s)]
*  We're running out of time. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5412.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's entirely too late to be talking about [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5414.0s)]
*  new candidates who aren't even in the race. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5416.24s)]
*  Not gonna happen. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5419.0s)]
*  I mean, this whole Gavin do some things of fantasy. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5419.84s)]
*  Even if Biden were to see the light and step down, [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5421.88s)]
*  be pressured to do that, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5425.7s)]
*  Kamala Harris just said, I'm ready to serve. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5427.04s)]
*  She wants to be president. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5429.68s)]
*  And even though she's not seen out, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5431.72s)]
*  she's actually even more unpopular than Biden. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5433.96s)]
*  So you have that huge problem with the Democratic Party [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5436.96s)]
*  that even if somehow they could prevail on Biden [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5439.32s)]
*  to step down, now you have Kamala Harris ready to serve. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5441.68s)]
*  So how do you pass over her? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5445.12s)]
*  He's not stepping down. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5446.32s)]
*  He didn't go through all of this craziness [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5447.68s)]
*  this past week to step down. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5449.72s)]
*  They didn't evade the cognitive test for him to step down. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5452.08s)]
*  They're not doing all of that. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5455.12s)]
*  They're not keeping him away from the media [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5456.08s)]
*  so that he can step down. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5458.44s)]
*  None of that is happening. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5459.5199999999995s)]
*  They're not having people come out with the soundbites [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5460.72s)]
*  about how he's got mastery of everything in private [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5463.64s)]
*  so that he can step down. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5466.36s)]
*  He's running, Donald Trump is running, and RFK is running. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5467.88s)]
*  Those will be the three people on the ballot [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5472.68s)]
*  in November of 2024. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5475.92s)]
*  Biden's staff are the absolute last people [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5477.88s)]
*  who would ever pressure him to step down. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5480.04s)]
*  Why? [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5481.92s)]
*  Because they'd be out of a job. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5482.74s)]
*  From the staff's point of view, having a weak president [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5484.88s)]
*  who basically they administer. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5488.360000000001s)]
*  It's not just a job. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5490.8s)]
*  It's like you allocate the future [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5491.88s)]
*  as the president of the United States. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5493.92s)]
*  You decide. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5495.400000000001s)]
*  It's the best situation possible for a staffer [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5496.240000000001s)]
*  is to have a president who is borderline incapacitated [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5498.76s)]
*  and you get to just do whatever you want. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5502.120000000001s)]
*  You are the president. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5503.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5505.52s)]
*  Jake, give us the rundown of the Tucker Putin thing. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5506.120000000001s)]
*  What'd you think? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5508.400000000001s)]
*  Just as a programming note, it came out. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5509.120000000001s)]
*  It dropped right after we taped. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5511.080000000001s)]
*  We would have covered it, obviously. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5512.200000000001s)]
*  We were not covering it for a reason. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5513.16s)]
*  I give him a B on it. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5515.4s)]
*  Could have been better, but it wasn't bad, [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5516.4s)]
*  all things considered. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5518.8s)]
*  I don't think any journalist is ever [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5520.24s)]
*  going to be able to trap Putin or get good information out [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5521.84s)]
*  of him or any of those things. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5526.8s)]
*  And if you have somebody like Tucker, who is obviously [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5528.88s)]
*  very sympathetic to Russia and who [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5531.2s)]
*  believes that the West forced Putin to invade Ukraine, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5533.5199999999995s)]
*  you're not going to get a really great interview. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5537.76s)]
*  I did think he had a great moment [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5540.6s)]
*  where he asked for the Wall Street Journal reporter back [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5541.96s)]
*  at that moment to take back with him. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5545.400000000001s)]
*  He did a lot of softball questions. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5548.400000000001s)]
*  He asked 43 questions during the interview. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5549.88s)]
*  About 15 of them were softballs and he had about six fastballs. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5553.120000000001s)]
*  But he lost control over the interview very early, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5556.96s)]
*  obviously, if you watched it. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5560.280000000001s)]
*  And that's just kind of like losing pocket control. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5562.64s)]
*  You're like Chris Collinsworth here. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5565.8s)]
*  I'm not asking for a technical analysis of the play. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5567.160000000001s)]
*  I'm asking you, what did you think of the interview? [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5569.44s)]
*  What did you take away from it? [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5571.919999999999s)]
*  What did you think going in? [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5573.28s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5574.48s)]
*  And was there a delta and a change going out? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5575.16s)]
*  Just a normal? [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5577.24s)]
*  No, because I've watched the other interviews. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5577.719999999999s)]
*  I watched Megyn Kelly's. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5579.599999999999s)]
*  I watched NBC's. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5580.679999999999s)]
*  He's done, I did a research on it. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5581.44s)]
*  He's done about nine interviews in the last 10 years. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5584.32s)]
*  So it's not like this was anything new. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5587.24s)]
*  And when you watch the other ones, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5589.12s)]
*  it's just Putin spinning and pontificating [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5590.639999999999s)]
*  and nothing gets accomplished. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5593.5599999999995s)]
*  And he doesn't answer hard questions. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5594.759999999999s)]
*  So I had six questions I said he should [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5596.36s)]
*  He did ask two of them, but he didn't ask the other really [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5599.4400000000005s)]
*  hard questions I had. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5602.64s)]
*  And so he's not, I wouldn't say Tucker [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5604.24s)]
*  is like the useful idiot like Hillary Clinton said, [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5610.12s)]
*  but he is biased. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5612.96s)]
*  And he didn't ask enough hard questions. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5614.04s)]
*  I would have asked three or four harder questions. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5615.76s)]
*  But you're not going to get a lot out of Putin. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5617.64s)]
*  This guy's like a KGB Stasi-trained manipulator [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5619.64s)]
*  of media. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5623.320000000001s)]
*  It's his speciality. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5623.8s)]
*  I had two really interesting takeaways. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5625.04s)]
*  The first was, if you had wanted to see some crazy madman, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5628.76s)]
*  you actually left that interview thinking, OK, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5634.0s)]
*  this is a person that's leading a nation that [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5637.52s)]
*  has a deep historical context that goes back to basically [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5639.360000000001s)]
*  the dawn of Christianity, of which he [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5643.68s)]
*  has a pretty deep grasp of. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5647.360000000001s)]
*  And it seems that his decisions are rooted [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5649.56s)]
*  in a multi-thousand year history. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5652.88s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5654.62s)]
*  And that was an interesting takeaway for me. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5655.64s)]
*  So that was a broad strategic takeaway. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5658.16s)]
*  So he was a little professorial. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5660.48s)]
*  He was a little historical. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5662.4s)]
*  And all of that, to me, made it harder [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5664.68s)]
*  for me to leave that interview thinking [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5667.44s)]
*  that he was a crazy person. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5669.36s)]
*  In fact, it's more like he's a bit of a methodical thinker, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5670.68s)]
*  I guess. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5676.28s)]
*  The second is much more tactical. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5677.2s)]
*  And I thought super salacious. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5678.72s)]
*  And I wish Tucker would have dug into it, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5680.24s)]
*  which is that in 1999, when he was meeting Bill Clinton, [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5683.2s)]
*  he asked Bill Clinton, can we join NATO? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5686.4s)]
*  And Bill Clinton said to him, yes. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5690.839999999999s)]
*  And let's go hash out the details over dinner. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5692.879999999999s)]
*  And then that night, they have dinner. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5696.36s)]
*  And Clinton says, my team says no. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5698.639999999999s)]
*  And to me, when I looked at the arc of that interview, [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5701.92s)]
*  that was one of these really unique moments [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5705.839999999999s)]
*  where it explains to me so much, which [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5707.799999999999s)]
*  is a country that's birthing a democracy, where Putin, [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5712.7s)]
*  transitioning from Yeltsin, had to make [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5718.98s)]
*  a lot of very important, difficult decisions. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5720.66s)]
*  The idea that he would have made an entreaty to Clinton [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5723.58s)]
*  to say, can we join NATO? [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5726.099999999999s)]
*  And then to be told yes and then rebuffed, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5728.66s)]
*  I suspect has an underlying amount of emotion [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5731.82s)]
*  that explains a lot of what's happened since. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5734.58s)]
*  And I think that that should have [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5737.66s)]
*  been explored much, much more. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5738.94s)]
*  I think they glossed over it and they went on. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5740.22s)]
*  But it was a really important moment. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5742.46s)]
*  Those are my two big takeaways from that interview. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5743.9s)]
*  Did you watch your free bird? [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5748.02s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5750.06s)]
*  I think when he said that point, he [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5750.9s)]
*  was talking in the theoretical, not in the I'd like to join [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5753.22s)]
*  NATO, because the intention of NATO [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5756.62s)]
*  was to create a unified defense against the Russian armament, [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5758.9800000000005s)]
*  which is the most significant besides the US. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5764.14s)]
*  And at that point, before China's rise, ahead of China. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5766.38s)]
*  So I think it doesn't make sense to be like, hey, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5771.5s)]
*  there's two sides of this defense system. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5774.18s)]
*  Let's unify the two sides of the defense system. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5777.86s)]
*  It literally is a nonsensical proposition. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5780.02s)]
*  That's not true. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5782.66s)]
*  Not true in 1999. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5783.5s)]
*  That's totally not true. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5784.74s)]
*  What was the other side? [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5786.58s)]
*  1999 was where we've tore this whole thing down. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5788.18s)]
*  It's no longer the Soviet Union. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5791.22s)]
*  Right, so what is NATO? [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5792.78s)]
*  It's Russia. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5793.7s)]
*  We're going to democracy. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5794.14s)]
*  It's probably just an organization [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5795.3s)]
*  that looks like any other organization, like ASEAN. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5797.06s)]
*  What's ASEAN? [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5799.7s)]
*  Well, ASEAN is an organization. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5800.86s)]
*  Could they have military defenses? [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5803.0199999999995s)]
*  Supposedly. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5804.7s)]
*  But it's a grab bag of countries. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5806.139999999999s)]
*  What's the Brits? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5807.82s)]
*  It's another grab bag of countries. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5808.74s)]
*  This is a defense alliance. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5810.179999999999s)]
*  This is an economic alliance. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5812.339999999999s)]
*  But in that moment, the justification for NATO [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5813.7s)]
*  was the least powerful it's had ever been. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5816.62s)]
*  So in some ways, joining NATO would [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5818.9s)]
*  have been akin to dismantling NATO and saying, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5820.82s)]
*  we don't need this anymore. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5822.94s)]
*  That's the point. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5824.139999999999s)]
*  Why would he say, why would the US and the Western Europe [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5824.86s)]
*  allies say, let's dismantle NATO? [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5828.38s)]
*  That's effectively what they would be doing. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5830.26s)]
*  Because the historical context of that moment is important. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5831.5s)]
*  He did it at the moment where they were transitioning [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5833.38s)]
*  to a democracy. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5835.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5836.5s)]
*  It's like saying, let's get rid of the defense system. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5836.820000000001s)]
*  When Russia was transforming into a democracy? [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5838.62s)]
*  Well, when the USSR was breaking down and transitioning [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5840.780000000001s)]
*  to a democracy. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5842.9400000000005s)]
*  How did that democracy go? [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5844.22s)]
*  If there was massive disarmament in Russia. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5845.46s)]
*  The question is, what would have happened had they said yes [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5848.14s)]
*  and Clinton took a different path? [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5850.900000000001s)]
*  All I'm saying is, guys, without prejudging it, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5852.34s)]
*  that was, I think, a very important context that [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5855.3s)]
*  is not understood in history. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5858.5s)]
*  I wouldn't dismiss it. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5861.3s)]
*  No, no, I certainly think everybody raised their eyes. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5862.58s)]
*  Really, that happened? [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5864.86s)]
*  What did you think of that moment? [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5866.34s)]
*  And then also Clinton, who is so steeped in history and policy, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5867.66s)]
*  is not somebody that would say something [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5873.06s)]
*  like that in an uncalculated way only to pull back. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5875.1s)]
*  That does not seem, and I know Bill Clinton, [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5878.18s)]
*  that is not who he is. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5881.22s)]
*  So just in that context, he is a very thoughtful person. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5883.14s)]
*  So he would have said that thinking, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5886.06s)]
*  wow, this makes a lot of sense on many dimensions. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5888.02s)]
*  And again, the concept was it was kind of like, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5890.620000000001s)]
*  let's sit down for dinner and figure out the details. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5894.580000000001s)]
*  And it's like, my team says no. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5896.620000000001s)]
*  And of course, the team would say no. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5898.9400000000005s)]
*  Because it's like, well, how are we going to solve it? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5900.5s)]
*  We haven't heard from Clinton confirming this [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5902.780000000001s)]
*  or how it was structured. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5905.740000000001s)]
*  It sounds like it was a thing. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5907.820000000001s)]
*  That was my interpretation. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5909.620000000001s)]
*  It just feels like a weird. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5911.1s)]
*  He said it and kind of shocked Clinton. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5912.1s)]
*  He's like, let me look into that? [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5913.6s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5915.42s)]
*  What did you think of that moment, Sachs, and then [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5916.46s)]
*  overall? [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5918.78s)]
*  Well, Jason, the fact that Putin sought to join it [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5919.42s)]
*  or at least made that offer is a well-known, well-documented [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5922.9s)]
*  historical fact. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5926.46s)]
*  This is definitely not the first time this has been raised. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5927.22s)]
*  More generally, I think what you heard in that interview [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5929.9800000000005s)]
*  once you got past the sort of the ancient history lecture [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5932.62s)]
*  is that Putin, when he first came to power, [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5936.58s)]
*  sought cordial relations with the US [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5938.9800000000005s)]
*  and with American presidents. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5942.7s)]
*  And he was rebuffed. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5944.14s)]
*  Attempt to join NATO was rebuffed. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5946.46s)]
*  More generally, the US reneged on his promise to Gorbachev [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5948.219999999999s)]
*  not to expand NATO one inch eastward. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5953.34s)]
*  And instead, we began multiple waves of NATO expansion. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5956.0599999999995s)]
*  And I think it's very important to understand that you don't [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5959.5s)]
*  need to believe Putin on this or trust Putin. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5962.0599999999995s)]
*  American diplomats were saying at the time [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5965.98s)]
*  what the ramifications of this would be. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5969.0199999999995s)]
*  And I just want to put two data points in evidence. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5971.179999999999s)]
*  One is George Kennan, who was the father of the containment [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5974.22s)]
*  doctrine during the Cold War. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5978.38s)]
*  He was our most respected Cold War diplomat. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5979.740000000001s)]
*  Said in the late 90s when they were first [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5982.9400000000005s)]
*  debating on NATO expansion, he said that, quote, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5984.62s)]
*  expanding NATO would be the most fateful era of American policy [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5988.66s)]
*  in the entire post-Cold War era. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5992.18s)]
*  So think about it. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5994.38s)]
*  This is somebody who's been around since the 1940s. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5995.18s)]
*  He was our chief diplomat and defined our containment policy [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=5998.3s)]
*  towards the Soviet Union. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6001.9800000000005s)]
*  And he said that expanding NATO would be the most fateful era [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6003.66s)]
*  of American foreign policy. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6006.94s)]
*  And he said that a decision like that [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6008.7s)]
*  would inflame the nationalist, anti-Western, [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6010.3s)]
*  and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6013.3s)]
*  It would have an adverse effect on the development [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6016.139999999999s)]
*  of Russian democracy. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6018.139999999999s)]
*  And it would restore the atmosphere of the Cold War. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6019.58s)]
*  So this is somebody who really knew what he was talking about [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6021.9s)]
*  and warned us not to go down this path. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6024.62s)]
*  And then in 2008, second data point [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6026.38s)]
*  is that Bill Burns, who was our ambassador to Moscow, who [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6029.139999999999s)]
*  is now Joe Biden's own CIA director, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6031.66s)]
*  wrote a memo to Condoleezza Rice, who [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6035.82s)]
*  was then Secretary of State, called, Niet Means Niet. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6038.22s)]
*  And what he said in that memo is that NATO expansion to Ukraine [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6040.86s)]
*  specifically is the brightest of all red lines [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6045.5s)]
*  for the entire Russian elite, not just Putin. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6048.38s)]
*  In other words, the idea of bringing Ukraine into NATO [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6050.98s)]
*  was an idea that was rejected not just by Putin [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6055.42s)]
*  or by hardliners, but even by liberal reformers [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6057.62s)]
*  inside of Russia. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6061.18s)]
*  And nevertheless, we persisted in this policy. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6062.06s)]
*  And so I think what you hear in that interview [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6065.1s)]
*  are a lot of points by Putin around how [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6069.38s)]
*  he sought good relations with the West. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6072.700000000001s)]
*  But what was our reaction to him? [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6075.54s)]
*  Pressure, pressure, pressure. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6077.38s)]
*  We supported the Maidan coup in 2014. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6079.3s)]
*  We tried to expand NATO into his backyard [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6082.3s)]
*  on his most vulnerable border. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6084.900000000001s)]
*  And then finally, we supported these hard-right, [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6086.46s)]
*  ultra-nationalist neo-Nazi elements in Ukraine. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6088.86s)]
*  Now, whether or not you believe everything that Putin said, [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6092.66s)]
*  my takeaway is that this was a rational actor. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6097.139999999999s)]
*  This was not a madman. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6100.7s)]
*  This is somebody who we could have negotiated with. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6102.54s)]
*  And in fact, there was still an opportunity before this war [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6105.7s)]
*  to prevent the war by taking NATO expansion off the table. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6109.339999999999s)]
*  We refused to do that. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6112.299999999999s)]
*  And even today, there was this new press story [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6113.339999999999s)]
*  that in the wake of this interview, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6117.139999999999s)]
*  the Biden administration still rejects entering negotiations [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6118.56s)]
*  with Russia, even though Putin held out that olive branch [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6122.160000000001s)]
*  in that interview. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6125.280000000001s)]
*  So again, this is very sad how we [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6126.04s)]
*  have conducted American-Russian relations over the last 25 [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6131.72s)]
*  years. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6136.160000000001s)]
*  We turned what could have been an ally into an enemy [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6136.660000000001s)]
*  and proven George Kennan correct. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6141.320000000001s)]
*  And I think this has been the most fateful era [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6143.080000000001s)]
*  of American policy in the last 30 years. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6144.84s)]
*  What an amazing episode this has been. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6149.16s)]
*  I think we talked about Tucker and Putin enough. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6151.0s)]
*  Love you, boys. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6152.48s)]
*  For the Sultan of Science, the Dictator, and the Rain Man, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6153.16s)]
*  I am the world's greatest moderator. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6157.839999999999s)]
*  We'll see you next time. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6159.839999999999s)]
*  Bye-bye. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6160.719999999999s)]
*  Bye-bye. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6161.28s)]
*  I'm going all in. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6161.78s)]
*  We'll let your winners ride. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6163.58s)]
*  Rain Man David Sack. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6166.38s)]
*  I'm going all in. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6168.86s)]
*  And instead, we open sourced it to the fans, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6170.34s)]
*  and they've just gone crazy with it. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6172.98s)]
*  Love you, Westies. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6174.82s)]

*  What, what, your winners ride? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6179.74s)]
*  I'm going all in. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6181.7s)]

*  Oh, man. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6191.38s)]
*  My hunk of ash will meet me at the window. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6191.86s)]
*  We should all just get a room and just have one big huge [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6194.0599999999995s)]
*  orgy because they're all just useless. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6196.42s)]
*  It's like sexual tension that they just [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6198.0199999999995s)]
*  need to release somehow. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6199.9s)]
*  What, your, beep, beep. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6202.0599999999995s)]
*  What, your, beep. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6203.86s)]

*  We need to get merch. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoTOF-plFwc&t=6207.34s)]
