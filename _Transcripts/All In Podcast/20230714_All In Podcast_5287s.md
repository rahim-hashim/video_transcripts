# E137 Inflation cools, market rips, RippleMSFT beat regulators, NATO summit, cocktails of youth
**All In Podcast:** [July 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI)
*  We don't have a cold open. Well since you guys decided to go rogue and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=0.0s)]
*  Agreed on a vacation week and then decided freeburg decided he would go rogue [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4.66s)]
*  It gave me a little extra time when I was whitewater rafting on a second [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=8.48s)]
*  Friedberg did not decide to go rogue. He went rogue your two peers decided to go rogue [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=12.18s)]
*  I was taking the week off. They both sent on the text stream [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=16.72s)]
*  We want to do a show this week and I said sure I'll do it. I mean, yes, but I'll do it wrong [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=19.28s)]
*  That's fun. You went wrong. Yeah, that's what I said. There was no vacation agreed to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=24.46s)]
*  You don't even know your schedule you're too busy writing 30 tweet storms about hunter Biden [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Why would all of a sudden there be a skip week in the middle of July? It's just cuz you were off [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=33.28s)]
*  No, we said [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=36.88s)]
*  Vacation no, I also have to give my producers a week off now and again because they work into the weekend editing the stuff [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=39.92s)]
*  So we're editors, but you're gonna swap them out. I have two editors [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=46.5s)]
*  Yes, I gave everybody the week off [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=49.66s)]
*  The point is that when one of us said no no is off on a given week the show goes on [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=50.88s)]
*  That's what you always say [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=57.12s)]
*  Then when you [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=59.12s)]
*  Have a need to go on vacation. No, then you know, it gets canceled [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=60.8s)]
*  No, what would have happened was what would have happened was I would have put one of my producers on for that week [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  I would have given the other one off but because we all said we're gonna be off that week [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=69.12s)]
*  I gave everybody off that week because I said let's take advantage of this. That's what actually happened, but that's fine [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=71.92s)]
*  Because you didn't go back to us. We had to have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=76.88s)]
*  Said to you in the chat. We're off this week. We're off this week and we confirmed with your teams [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=80.36s)]
*  Multiple times we're off this week. It's no big deal [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=85.0s)]
*  If you want to go to weeks in here, we want to record this one Wednesday on Wednesday when everybody had already been given off [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=87.0s)]
*  I know that everybody who works for you is sir. You just went dark. I [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  I we Nick and I both responded. We're off this week, please don't pretend like you're a great boss [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=96.56s)]
*  We all know what about I know that you're I know that the search should work for you [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=101.69999999999999s)]
*  Do not get days off, but I treat the people who work on your organization turn on my organization [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=105.53999999999999s)]
*  What's the average tenure of one of your employees like six months? No, no, actually, it's more like [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=111.92s)]
*  Four or five years ready. I mean I have people for five to ten years now. It's pretty impressive actually [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=118.2s)]
*  You know what's interesting my tenure is actually bimodal. It's either [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=122.92s)]
*  Years and years and years and years or out the door one year or months. Yes [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=126.92s)]
*  That's the way it should be either you hit the notes or you don't and you should know quickly [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=130.76s)]
*  There's nothing in the middle. Yeah, that's the way it should be actually I was sitting by the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=134.96s)]
*  The river went whitewater rafting on the rogue river when Freberg went rogue why am I the one who went rogue because I don't like you [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=140.02s)]
*  That's all reason I'm not blaming the other two guys I'm friends with them it's obvious [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=149.38000000000002s)]
*  so [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=154.10000000000002s)]
*  All right, the big news this week is inflation has eased to 3% in June we'll throw up a chart here [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=169.3s)]
*  It's the slowest pace in more than two years. So the feds [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=175.02s)]
*  Increases have worked and I guess the question now is [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=178.22s)]
*  Are we going to have a sustained high interest rate or is it going to get cut slowly? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=182.5s)]
*  Chamath and Freberg you've been talking to a number of people about this [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=188.22000000000003s)]
*  I think the biggest thing is that the feds are going to be able to get a little bit of a better [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  I think we're talking to a number of people about this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=196.98s)]
*  I think all-in summit 2023 speaker Larry Summers has been pretty vocal about this. What's your take free Burke? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=198.9s)]
*  Yeah [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=205.62s)]
*  I mean [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=205.82s)]
*  I think Larry said publicly that he thinks that rates are going to need to be higher for longer than what the market is [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=206.02s)]
*  Currently showing we talked last week with Brad obviously [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=212.5s)]
*  About what the market is showing rates to be and he's assuming some rate cuts will start to happen in December [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=216.3s)]
*  and that's really what the market is saying it's going to happen and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=221.5s)]
*  Brad's point was the market knows better than the forecasters [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=224.34s)]
*  But Larry Summers has publicly shared that he thinks that that is actually not correct [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=227.42s)]
*  And you know again diversity of views is important to understand [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=233.3s)]
*  that there are structural things that are happening in the world right now including a decoupling from China, which is inflationary because [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=237.3s)]
*  You know China provides cheap goods and cheap manufacturing for a lot of industries and many of those industries sell to consumers [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=244.14s)]
*  So ultimately those prices are going to show up in consumer costs. There's an increase in energy transition [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=251.38s)]
*  expenditure and security [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=259.02s)]
*  Globally and Summers has pointed out that those are not free. They have to be funded and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=261.18s)]
*  Obviously taking on more funding means you're gonna have to pay higher interest rates for investors to provide that capital to do that funding [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=266.42s)]
*  So there are more structural [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=272.54s)]
*  longer term [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=275.42s)]
*  Friends that [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=276.94s)]
*  Some folks in the Summers camp have been arguing are gonna be driving [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=278.34s)]
*  Inflation higher and keep rates higher for much longer than what the market is currently showing and I think it's really worth noting that point of view [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=282.21999999999997s)]
*  Particularly given how quickly the market thinks rates are gonna start getting cut [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=290.14s)]
*  Chamath you've been talking about the interest rates and that you believe it'll be persistent so higher for longer [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=293.09999999999997s)]
*  You're sticking with higher for longer on the interest rates. I assume. Yeah, I think the more important thing from that [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=299.9s)]
*  Jcal is [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=305.5s)]
*  So what do we do about it? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=306.86s)]
*  and I think the most important point of view that I'm trying to get to is where do I think the equity market is going to go and [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  You know all roads at least right now look like the market is getting set to go materially higher [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=315.82000000000005s)]
*  And the reason isn't whether you know terminal rates are at 2% or 3% or 3 and a half percent [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  I don't think that matters that much [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=329.02000000000004s)]
*  What matters more are the trillions of dollars that are sitting on the sideline or in other defensive assets [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=331.46s)]
*  That need to then pivot around and get put back into growth assets once you know that the worst is behind us [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=337.97999999999996s)]
*  and I think that's what a market always looks for before real sentiment changes and [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=345.02s)]
*  What's important to note is that by the time most people figure out that the sentiment has changed? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=350.65999999999997s)]
*  It's already actually too late and so I think right now in the next sort of like 12 to 18 months is really when the bottom [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=356.1s)]
*  Is put into the market. It's before the Fed starts cutting. It's when rates are still going to be relatively high [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=363.5s)]
*  but the [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=370.38s)]
*  Really astute sharp in this market [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=372.02s)]
*  Will get ahead of it and they will start to buy [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=375.86s)]
*  What they think will be an eventual rally and then it's gonna get supported [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=379.1s)]
*  By the fact that if not enough people are also long [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=384.84s)]
*  You get caught on the wrong side. You don't necessarily have to be short [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=389.36s)]
*  You just aren't long enough and what that does is put pressure on your business model [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=393.02s)]
*  So if you're a mutual fund or if you're a hedge fund and you've missed most of this rally [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=397.84s)]
*  Which most people have because it's really only been five or six companies [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=401.96s)]
*  So I think that Larry is right I think that I still believe what I've said for a while which is rates will be higher for longer [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=407.12s)]
*  But what I didn't believe before [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=413.28s)]
*  Was that the market was set to go up. I think we did a great job [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  I think literally that when I made that comment November of 21 about starting to sell it was the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=418.96s)]
*  Absolute top of the market. Yeah, you know that one. You know that one nailed it. Yeah, and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=425.52s)]
*  I think my commentary now is that we're putting in the bottom and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  I think the market is set to go materially higher even if rates [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=433.68s)]
*  Are persistently higher for a while just to challenge you on that second point [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=438.28s)]
*  The bottom really was put in maybe last summer you're really speaking to the psychology and the dynamics of capital allocation [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=441.47999999999996s)]
*  there are people who were scared maybe and thought the bottom could get much worse and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=448.03999999999996s)]
*  They didn't want to put money at play. There were some people who are brave enough to put money in play in the last 12 months [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=454.08s)]
*  Oh, I'll give myself a pat on the back [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=458.88s)]
*  I did jay trading starting last summer and I'm up whatever 25% something crazy like that because I picked all the big tech companies [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=460.64s)]
*  But you're saying now because that's but that's a good example just to pick on that the reason you did well [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=466.36s)]
*  Was mostly because they were oversold [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  Meaning that was my perception [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  If you look at those big tech companies and but that's not a sustainable thing if you're trying to own great companies [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=477.64000000000004s)]
*  The reality is those seven companies [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=482.96000000000004s)]
*  One of them Nvidia is actually firing on all cylinders [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=485.40000000000003s)]
*  Everybody else just stopped acting like a fucking moron. Hmm, and that's not a sustainable business strategy [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=489.8s)]
*  Meaning, you know [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=496.04s)]
*  Burning billions and billions of dollars a quarter totally wastefully with all kinds of random free stuff to a bunch of entitled side [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=497.72s)]
*  Project side quests and then taking that away [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=504.68s)]
*  Doesn't ensure long-term success for anybody [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=508.16s)]
*  All it does is just turn to kits the bleeding and so you have more material short-term cash flow and the markets are gonna reward it [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=510.82000000000005s)]
*  Especially in a moment where it's the trade-off is against rates short-term rates that are five or six percent [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=518.88s)]
*  But from here [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=524.24s)]
*  right [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=525.88s)]
*  The real long-term value creation is still going to go to the companies that are building true product market fit in product value [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=526.88s)]
*  Well, and are are and are really growing in a material way [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=534.8399999999999s)]
*  From adoption and usage not from cost-cutting because people see through that and when rates start to get cut [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=539.0799999999999s)]
*  They'll see through it even faster [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=546.9599999999999s)]
*  The only time [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=549.04s)]
*  Cost cutting gets rewarded is when short-term rates are this high because people love short-term cash flow [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=550.28s)]
*  Yeah, and it was when the the moment I saw Zuckerberg and Airbnb Uber other places just start and obviously Google and Microsoft [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=555.58s)]
*  Start making cuts. You're like, okay people are going to lower their costs [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=563.68s)]
*  They're doing triage as you're saying to make the balance sheet to make the early hours works in the final third of a bear market [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=566.84s)]
*  Okay, so but triage does not work in a bull market. You don't get rewarded for triage in the bull market [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=572.92s)]
*  Totally get it. You have to innovate you have to build great products. So Saxman you're looking at the overall market [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=578.64s)]
*  I think we talked about the average [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=583.6s)]
*  Recession or downturn is six quarters plus or minus one or two historically [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=586.16s)]
*  We are entering the seventh quarter of the downturn at least in tech started by tech in the first quarter of [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=590.48s)]
*  2022 here we are in the third quarter [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=597.0s)]
*  Starting in July of 2023. What's your take on what the next six quarters look like? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=599.4s)]
*  Are we going to be sideways or are we going to as Chammat saying? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=604.54s)]
*  Hey, there's a lot of people are trying to pay catch-up [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=607.72s)]
*  They missed this bump and now they're competing and they have to at the end of the year [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=609.72s)]
*  Capital allocators are going to show in their yearly reports what they did this year and now they're like hey [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=614.48s)]
*  We got to put some some bets into some high-growth companies [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=619.32s)]
*  Is this the setup for another mania and maybe unhealthy behavior? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=621.6800000000001s)]
*  so Jason [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=626.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna be a mania [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=626.9200000000001s)]
*  but I do think that the market is ripping today because the market is basically pricing in the idea of a soft landing along with [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=627.96s)]
*  Inflation being tamed so you had a positive CPI report at 3% [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=635.76s)]
*  You had a hot jobs report a week or two ago [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=639.32s)]
*  And there's a interesting article in the Wall Street Journal today talking about the odds of a soft landing improving [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=641.8000000000001s)]
*  And they have some data for that. I don't particularly agree with the sub headline [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=648.48s)]
*  They're trying to latest data suggests a lot of past inflation was transitory. That seems yeah [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=651.5600000000001s)]
*  That I think is is being too charitable to the Fed because when they use the word transitory [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=657.2s)]
*  They were using as an excuse not to raise interest rates and we just had the fastest rate tightening cycle ever [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=662.4s)]
*  Over the past year. That's the reason why inflation has gone down [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=669.72s)]
*  It was not transitory until they jacked up interest rates from 0 to 5% [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=673.22s)]
*  So the Wall Street Journal I think is doing a little covering for the Fed there [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=677.64s)]
*  But nonetheless, I think everybody is pleasantly surprised that a CPI is now down to 3% and B [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=681.64s)]
*  You have not had a significant cooling of the jobs market [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=689.56s)]
*  So certainly the odds now of a soft landing have gone up and the thing that's sort of surprising [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=693.12s)]
*  About what Larry Summers is saying is that if you believe that [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=699.36s)]
*  Inflation is going to come roaring back. That's certainly a contrarian bet [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=704.76s)]
*  That's not what the market is saying right now what the market is predicting right now [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=708.0s)]
*  And the reason why stocks are rallying is what the market is thinking is well if inflation is down to 3% [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=711.4s)]
*  And we can end the year at 3 or even lower [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=717.28s)]
*  Then the Fed can start cutting next year and so they're starting a price in rate cuts [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=720.84s)]
*  But if inflation comes roaring back, you're not gonna get rate cuts and so stock prices are gonna go down [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=725.44s)]
*  I don't see how you can have a scenario of even higher interest rates from here [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  Along with higher stock prices [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=735.6800000000001s)]
*  I think you need lower rates to get higher stock prices and one of Brad's [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=737.76s)]
*  Charts shows this if you look at the software index the median [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=742.12s)]
*  Enterprise value divided by next 12 months revenue. What you see here is that the mean [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=748.2s)]
*  Multiple is seven point seven excluding the kovat [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=755.4399999999999s)]
*  Distortion we're at six point six now. So there is room [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=758.72s)]
*  For the software index to run up pretty nicely here. You could argue that [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=762.56s)]
*  Or fairly valued you see the ten years at three point eight percent if you compare it to where we were before [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=768.6999999999999s)]
*  Kovat when interest rates were in the mid twos to around three percent [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=774.86s)]
*  Yeah, we got to an 18x multiple. It was crazy. Yeah, so basically if interest rates go down [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=780.84s)]
*  I think for sure you'll see multiples go up, but I think if interest rates gonna keep going up from here [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=785.98s)]
*  Then you're not gonna get that rally or I don't see why you would well the thing to keep in mind is I think this [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=791.58s)]
*  Chart is not that helpful because this is all unprofitable software companies [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=796.34s)]
*  So I think the more important thing is to look at the broad-based index [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=801.1800000000001s)]
*  The thing with these companies is that even if rates are at three percent or six percent or two percent or one percent? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=805.82s)]
*  that [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=812.46s)]
*  Trick is over these companies are not going to get out of this cul-de-sac until they figure out [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=813.74s)]
*  true product market fit how to eliminate your and how to drive medium to long-term profitability and [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=818.7800000000001s)]
*  Most of them unfortunately don't have a clear path to that and the problem is all of the old legacy [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=824.02s)]
*  software companies ex of Salesforce have still not got to profitability [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=830.6600000000001s)]
*  So meaning the ones that went public and like the early teens are still sucking wind losing money [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=835.34s)]
*  So the idea that software businesses generate long-term profits is so far unfortunately been a fallacy [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=840.38s)]
*  So that chart I think will stay exactly the same way it is [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=846.6600000000001s)]
*  I think the bloom is off the rose but where the money can go change that though [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=850.5s)]
*  Which mouth which it would what we need to stop at this point to look talk about these SAS companies because what would change [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=854.64s)]
*  That if they actually get to profitability and sex [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=859.26s)]
*  What's the chances they get to profitability because that would make them look more like Microsoft or the biggest problem that software as a service? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=861.2s)]
*  Businesses have is the same thing that it benefits from which is cycle time [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=867.7800000000001s)]
*  So the cycle time for a SAS business to build a feature set to get product market fit and to get early revenue is [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=872.5s)]
*  Very short [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=879.06s)]
*  The problem with that is that is the equivalent amount of time it takes for a competitor or several competitors to compartmentalize [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=880.6999999999999s)]
*  And chop and slice and dice that feature set into a bunch of smaller subscale SAS products that then go after it and cannibalize that revenue [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=887.38s)]
*  So I think the issue that they have is they show [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=894.54s)]
*  contractually a lot of [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=898.26s)]
*  Revenue expansion that looks good on the service [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=900.66s)]
*  But underneath these guys are in this constant hamster wheel of trying to build features and trying to keep their head above water [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=903.46s)]
*  And all of that dreading [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=910.54s)]
*  Consumes enormous amounts of cash and so from an op-ex perspective these SAS businesses [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=913.86s)]
*  They just suck. They don't generate free cash flow except for a few. Let me let me bring sex into the sex [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=919.54s)]
*  Do you think that these companies will get to having a PE ratio? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=925.46s)]
*  Because a lot of times you pull them up and it's like price earnings ratio not applicable for this company because there are no earnings [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=930.1s)]
*  And you've dedicated your career to SAS and you've built a billion dollar company. So give us the other side [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=934.86s)]
*  The other side of it is that software businesses have great gross margins [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=940.14s)]
*  I mean you spend all of your R&D creating the first instance of the product and they're [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=943.9s)]
*  Thereafter every additional instance of the product is basically almost free to provision on the margin. So these are super high margin businesses [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=947.86s)]
*  Once you achieve dominance in your category, there's a bunch of different modes [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=955.6999999999999s)]
*  You can create a platform you have the largest sales and marketing operation [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=959.74s)]
*  Everyone wants to go with the market leader [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=965.3s)]
*  so there's [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=968.54s)]
*  You know a bunch of different ways to lock in your advantage and not all those companies are losing money a growing number of them [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=970.42s)]
*  Are making money. I just think that's like a sweeping over generalization [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=975.42s)]
*  So I still think software businesses are some of the best businesses [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=978.66s)]
*  But why don't they [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=982.26s)]
*  We're off on a little bit of a tangent here [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=985.1s)]
*  which is I could have shown you a slide of [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=987.02s)]
*  Almost any basket of growth stocks and you would have had something similar which is they're still trading below [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=991.02s)]
*  their seven-year mean on a multiple basis [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=998.18s)]
*  And so my point was simply that if interest rates are coming down there is room for these stocks to go right about that [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1001.42s)]
*  Let me bring free bergen free berg in the summers camp and some other people's camp [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1009.1800000000001s)]
*  They believe interest rates have to go higher despite the fact that inflation has plummeted and it feels like a [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1013.86s)]
*  For pal that this is a mission accomplished moment [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1020.5400000000001s)]
*  The reasons they believe that are the infrastructure and chips bill are gonna pour money into the United States [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1023.22s)]
*  And we're gonna have massive spending. We already have absurd 50-year low [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1029.02s)]
*  unemployment [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1034.42s)]
*  Which is insane we still have close to 10 million job openings we have locked the borders [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1035.86s)]
*  We now have Democrats and Republicans back-to-back saying we're not gonna let people into the country [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1041.2199999999998s)]
*  We've so I don't know who's gonna work in all these factories if we don't have an immigration policy [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1046.26s)]
*  So maybe you could tell us if you actually believe this sort of let's call it the summers [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1050.5s)]
*  Doctrine here or the the contrarian summers position [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1055.9399999999998s)]
*  6-7 percent [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1059.78s)]
*  interest rates are coming because we're going to have [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1061.54s)]
*  persistent [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1065.5s)]
*  inflation and if you believe that contrarian take I think there's a [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1067.02s)]
*  General statement that can be made that we are coming out of a zero interest rate environment into [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1071.26s)]
*  Which lasted for a very long period of time? [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1078.9s)]
*  Into a very stimulatory environment because of [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1084.38s)]
*  Government spending and [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1090.78s)]
*  When you have [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1093.22s)]
*  government spending stimulating the economy you have a natural market force of [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1095.1s)]
*  inflation coming from the additional capital being pumped into the economy and the purchasing and [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1101.1s)]
*  And all that sort of stuff like you pointed out 50-year [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1107.02s)]
*  low and unemployment and we're trying to create a bunch of new jobs and [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1110.34s)]
*  Who's gonna fill those jobs? You're gonna have to pay people more to get them to take those jobs [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1114.5s)]
*  So, you know you're gonna see a rising wages and then [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1117.8999999999999s)]
*  You pay people more but there's nobody looking for jobs [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1124.7s)]
*  We're kind of that's I think the conundrum we're in people. You can boost the labor participation rate, right? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1128.82s)]
*  You can attract more people to the workforce. Yeah, and it drives wage growth, but ultimately keep this in mind [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1134.74s)]
*  So the lower wage workers, let's use a simple example people that work in fast food [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1139.6599999999999s)]
*  There if their rates go from you know, eight bucks to fifteen bucks to twenty five bucks an hour [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1143.94s)]
*  The cost of fast food goes up. So on the food price index you'll see a rise in in food prices [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1149.26s)]
*  so right now it seems like the Fed and the market are all acknowledging and reacting to you know, these these I [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1154.42s)]
*  Don't I would kind of argue acute [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1163.46s)]
*  Conditions that are being resolved from coming out of the kovat stimulation [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1166.42s)]
*  But there are in place as the comments have been made increased spending to NATO because of global security concerns [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1170.26s)]
*  Increased defense spending globally the current projection from the CBO [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1177.34s)]
*  Showing what defense spending is going to be as a percentage of GDP or percentage of government spending [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1181.74s)]
*  There are some folks as you guys all know [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1186.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, do you would speak to in DC who think that those numbers are BS because we're gonna increase defense spending not cut it [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1188.3799999999999s)]
*  Because of global security concerns, particularly as we decouple from China [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1196.1s)]
*  And all of the energy transition stuff the IRA the Chips Act, which is a security thing. These are all stimulatory [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1200.22s)]
*  so the tides come in and out but the sea levels are rising and [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1206.1s)]
*  Over time that translates into a way to manage [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1210.3s)]
*  The inflation but also to raise the capital which means you have to pay higher rates [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1213.6599999999999s)]
*  And this is this is in the EU and the US that it seems this is going to be the case. So I [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1218.98s)]
*  Feel like we've gone in a circle a little bit which is good [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1225.7s)]
*  I think just to show how complex the issue is and we're trying to predict the weather here or at least understand the weather patterns [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1228.1000000000001s)]
*  So let's talk about the driving force in this and CPI the first word is consumer Chamath [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1234.18s)]
*  Stimmy check summer last year and the year before [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1240.26s)]
*  NFT crypto, you know secure your bag summer. I think was this the same sort of phenomenon and [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1243.54s)]
*  And [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1250.18s)]
*  Unlimited, you know double or triple bonus unemployment plus deferring your student loans those four things [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1251.38s)]
*  Were you know pretty much defined the last two years and all of them have come to a crashing halt [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1259.18s)]
*  You can't get unlimited unemployment. You got to start paying your student loans in September from my understanding [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1263.6200000000001s)]
*  and [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1269.94s)]
*  Here you're paying rent. Oh, yeah. Wow, what a crazy concept [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1271.38s)]
*  You know, so we have five factors there you have to you have to pay your landlord your rent [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1276.06s)]
*  So let's talk about the consumer for a quick second here. Is this the last hurrah summer? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1280.06s)]
*  people consumers are going to need to get back to work in September because [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1285.62s)]
*  It seems like the credit card debts going up. We talked about that over the last year and if consumers aren't spending [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1289.02s)]
*  You know, that's going to be the driving force and that was the goal of raising the interest rates is to maybe get consumers to have [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1295.02s)]
*  A higher car bill a higher mortgage bill and to get back to work. Yeah, I mean, I think that's very well summarized [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1301.38s)]
*  I think that we [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1308.3000000000002s)]
*  Are absorbing all the excess liquidity in the economy that would otherwise have gone into really speculative things [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1310.5800000000002s)]
*  The extra vacation the extra pair of shoes on [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1320.46s)]
*  Stock X or whatever the extra NFT the extra this the extra that that's all out the window [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1325.14s)]
*  A traditional home mortgage is probably doubled in terms of your monthly payments. Yeah, people will be forced to get back to work [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1332.3400000000001s)]
*  They'll have to stay in jobs longer. They'll have to [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1338.3400000000001s)]
*  Just do a much better job of managing their finances [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1344.1000000000001s)]
*  But all of that doesn't necessarily mean that the US economy falls off a cliff [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1348.22s)]
*  I think that the thing we have to remember is that and I don't think we can explain it actually [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1352.5800000000002s)]
*  Very well because every time an economist has tried to do it, I don't think they've really figured this out [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1358.6599999999999s)]
*  but we tend to have a very resilient level of consumer demand and [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1363.58s)]
*  when you look at [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1369.5s)]
*  The correlation between consumer demand and the underlying economy even in periods of extreme shock [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1371.1399999999999s)]
*  So even like the pandemic is one of those moments where yeah the demand fell off the cliff [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1376.1399999999999s)]
*  But that's because we were literally prevented from doing anything [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1380.8999999999999s)]
*  We could not buy the things that we wanted to right or if you even go back to 2007 2008 in the great financial crisis [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1384.02s)]
*  The interesting thing about consumer demand is that it snaps back very quickly [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1391.5s)]
*  so there's this weird dynamic where folks have a base level of spending and [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1396.26s)]
*  they use an amount of debt to basically, you know subsidize that and [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1401.94s)]
*  Then they're willing to work in order to make sure that that doesn't change and I think that that's what we're getting back to [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1407.3s)]
*  We're gonna get people off the sidelines into the labor market and [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1412.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's gonna keep going sacks. I think it's all psychology [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1417.72s)]
*  like if you're I think people's spending is a function of their optimism and like maybe their last trade [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1421.28s)]
*  Yeah, or their last bank statement. So it's like oh my NFT tripled [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1427.6s)]
*  Therefore it's going to triple again next month and hey, there's a chance at my co-ten X. Oh, I invested in the startup [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1431.8s)]
*  Oh, you know, I'm getting stemming checks [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1437.2s)]
*  I'll get another stemming check and now if they get three or four moments in time where oh [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1438.74s)]
*  My NFT is now or 10% I can't defer my student loans anymore. Oh, I'm a curing interest. Oh, no the house [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1444.06s)]
*  I bought now has a 15% mortgage and I was on variable [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1451.26s)]
*  So what's your thoughts on the psychology of the consumer here? And is everybody just still spending but maybe downgrading a little bit? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1454.94s)]
*  Maybe they buy the Tesla Model 3 instead of the you know, going for the Model S [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1461.98s)]
*  They take business class instead taking business class or economy plus they do a staycation and drive somewhere [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1466.24s)]
*  I've been surprised at this how resilient the economy has been I [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1472.64s)]
*  Figured that after all the distortions we had in the economy all the stimulus during kovat [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1476.88s)]
*  We basically floored the accelerator and then slammed on the brakes with this incredibly rapid rate tightening cycle [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1481.32s)]
*  I thought for sure that was gonna basically crash the economy. I was in the Druckenmiller camp on this [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1487.04s)]
*  But I think again what you're seeing over the last few weeks it's just more and more evidence that it could be a soft landing [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1493.3999999999999s)]
*  that we may not have a recession and [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1499.24s)]
*  We might even get rate cuts next year [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1502.2s)]
*  But I do think that right now the risks are probably as balanced as they've been [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1504.08s)]
*  So if you want to pull up Nick, can you pull up that chart the quadrants from the Co2 summit? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1508.8s)]
*  I thought this was actually a pretty interesting chart that we saw at the Co2 summit as a useful framework for thinking about the scenarios [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1513.2s)]
*  for the economy [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1520.08s)]
*  Yeah, so basically it's a two by two quadrant where on one axis you've got inflation and inflation can be either low or high based on [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1523.44s)]
*  3% being the dividing line and then the economy can be either weak or strong with four and a half percent unemployment being the dividing line [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1531.24s)]
*  so if you believe that inflation is coming down below 3% and [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1538.4199999999998s)]
*  Unemployment is gonna stay below four and a half percent [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1543.52s)]
*  I think it's already at like three and a half percent right now [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1546.0s)]
*  Then you're back in the sustained growth quadrant in which case the S&P 500 is gonna keep ripping on the other hand if inflation is [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1549.28s)]
*  Above 3% with low unemployment. You're back in the overheating [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1558.48s)]
*  Quadrant which is probably bad for stocks now. You could have a situation in which [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1562.72s)]
*  Inflation goes down and remains good [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1567.74s)]
*  But unemployment goes way up in which case that'd be the hard landing and then the final quadrant is stagflation where you've got high [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1569.92s)]
*  inflation and high unemployment, so [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1576.32s)]
*  I think the quadrants right now are probably as balanced as they've been in quite some time in terms of where we could end [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1579.44s)]
*  Up in let's say a year. Yeah, I think that for you are so yeah, there's some early [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1584.64s)]
*  signals [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1590.24s)]
*  That you can look to to get a sense of where this may be going Disney World is empty [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1591.3600000000001s)]
*  The lines are really short. I don't know if you guys have any friends that have been to Disney World lately or Disneyland [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1597.18s)]
*  It was in the Wall Street Journal. The traffic has fallen off a cliff. Yeah, and there's just there's another go-broke company [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1601.08s)]
*  That's a really interesting point is do you think that Disney traffic? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1609.2s)]
*  Has gone down because the conservative half of the country basically feels ascended and they're right a la Bud Light [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1613.32s)]
*  Yes, or is it a larger consumer spending problem? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1620.1200000000001s)]
*  everybody everywhere else is still spending like even if you go to like look at the World Series of poker main event this year had [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1622.8s)]
*  The historic number of entries everything is telling you that people are getting their last hurrah [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1629.8400000000001s)]
*  So the fact that Disney has been decaying for the past year is [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1634.78s)]
*  more emblematic of the fact that they've gotten into this social culture war and half the population of America said we're not going to support your [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1638.66s)]
*  Business like they did to Bud Light and I'm not adjudicating the rightness or wrongness of either Bud Light or Disney [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1645.7s)]
*  But the answer is in the actual results. The people are not walking into the store just to show this while we're on Disney [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1651.9s)]
*  So here's a Disney chart for you just to show you the times at the different parks over the years [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1658.78s)]
*  It is in 2023 meaningfully shorter than 2022 or pre pandemic [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1663.06s)]
*  So I don't know if that's a function of their technology that they've been deploying or if maybe conservatives are not going [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1668.22s)]
*  But there's also another X Factor, which is the previous [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1674.1799999999998s)]
*  head of Disney who got ousted and Bob Iger's back was the guy who ran parks and he [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1677.78s)]
*  Just leaned into changing the pricing and it got absurdly expensive and they got rid of like the California pass and all that stuff [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1683.8999999999999s)]
*  So I think the the jury's out on this one Bob Chapin [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1690.8999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but there's a broader consumer spending question that I'm saying there may be some early signals [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1693.86s)]
*  Most consumers rely on credit as you guys know interest rates are rising and that passes through to consumers purchasing goods [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1698.26s)]
*  but other folks look at the metric of consumer credit card balance as a percentage of savings or percentage of [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1703.78s)]
*  Earnings which is actually a little bit lower given wage growth and savings that have accumulated [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1711.02s)]
*  Regardless, there are other signals we can look to so if you pull up this chart [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1715.74s)]
*  This just shows a really important [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1718.6999999999998s)]
*  statistic so [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1721.46s)]
*  80% of new car purchases are financed meaning you take out a loan to buy the car [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1723.3s)]
*  40% of used cars are financed and interest rates on car loans as you guys can see in this chart in just the last year [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1729.5s)]
*  So interest rates have spiked from under 4% called 3.7% [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1737.06s)]
*  to an average of 7% today and that obviously translates into a [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1742.3s)]
*  Doubling of the monthly payment needed to buy a car and now if you go to the next image [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1747.02s)]
*  So this is now playing through in terms of used car demand and used car prices in the last month [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1753.06s)]
*  It was reported by Cox Automotive that the pricing for used cars has declined by 4.2% [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1759.82s)]
*  And so this starts to indicate that there may be a bit of a softness emerging we could argue [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1766.38s)]
*  Yes, this is having a positive effect on the inflationary conditions [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1771.78s)]
*  But it may also be an indication of consumer spending and that we're starting to get to a point where credit is so expensive [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1774.58s)]
*  And consumers ability to flex credit is being decreased and that's starting to translate through into what everyone's been worried about [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1779.9399999999998s)]
*  Which is the recessionary or declining effect on revenue declining effect on profit of companies that are selling goods and services [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1786.4199999999998s)]
*  So that is obviously the challenge to Sachs's point on that two-by-two matrix on it [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1793.1s)]
*  You know [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1797.74s)]
*  if you if you reduce cost and reduce demand too much you can have a recessionary effect and [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1798.02s)]
*  Consumers are a big driver of this and so many consumers depend on credit. It's a it's gonna be a big condition to watch [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1803.74s)]
*  austerity measures [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1809.8200000000002s)]
*  Are gonna happen. Here's the chart of quarterly revenue for Disney. Yeah, still doing great [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1811.74s)]
*  I bought the stock and it's the one thing in my jay trading portfolio [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1817.6200000000001s)]
*  I've gotten crushing on that in one of brothers discovery made two entertainment bets and what I think are the two best companies [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1820.8600000000001s)]
*  I also did Netflix but [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1825.46s)]
*  One out of three ain't good [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1827.46s)]
*  Alright so some breaking news here that we'll try to dovetail together with this [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1829.22s)]
*  Lena con and the FTC losing their Activision case apparently and it's breaking news a partial win is what it looks like [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1835.54s)]
*  Let me read this here judge gives ripple [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1843.26s)]
*  Partial win in SEC case over XRP currency ripple labs ink violated federal securities law in its sale of cryptocurrency XRP directly to [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1845.9s)]
*  Savisicated investors, but it sells on public exchanges did not involve securities [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1853.54s)]
*  A US judge said in a ruling that sent the cryptocurrency soaring XRP was up 25% after the ruling [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1858.54s)]
*  SEC had accused the company and its current and former chief executives conducting a 1.3 billion dollar unregistered security offering by selling XRP [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1865.42s)]
*  Which ripples founders created in 2012 US District? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1873.46s)]
*  Judge who was based in New York on Thursday said the company's [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1877.6000000000001s)]
*  728 point nine million of XRP cells to hedge funds and other sophisticated buyers amounted to unregistered sales of securities [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1881.44s)]
*  but [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1888.92s)]
*  Torres ruled [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1890.0s)]
*  XRP sales on public cryptocurrency exchanges were not [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1891.5s)]
*  Offers of securities under the law because the purchases did not have a reasonable expectation of profit tied to ripples effort [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1895.3600000000001s)]
*  Okay, those cells were blind bid as transaction [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1902.68s)]
*  she said where the buyers could not have known if their payments I'm reading from [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1906.92s)]
*  Reuters here of money went to ripple or any other seller of XRP interesting. So the buyer becomes the [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1911.76s)]
*  The person who profits from it becomes the the fulcrum here XRP sells on cryptocurrency platform [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1918.28s)]
*  I'm gonna figure this out in real time. This is too complicated. The bottom line is that [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1923.68s)]
*  The headline is I want to make sure the audience gets it [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1928.48s)]
*  Yeah, look the headline is I mean the tweet ripple sales of XRP do not constitute offer of investment contracts according to judge [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1931.28s)]
*  They won. This is a huge vindication for them and that XRP is ripping 35% [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1938.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and it really handcuffs the SEC. What are they gonna do about coinbase and every other exchange? [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1944.84s)]
*  I mean if they're not selling securities, I think coinbase and everybody else has always maintained [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1951.6399999999999s)]
*  They're selling tokens. This is the this was the fulcrum argument for the SEC and they just they just lost [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1956.78s)]
*  The whole crypto market is ripping right now [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1962.46s)]
*  It's an interesting one. The confounding part of this is that the initial sale to accredited investors and hedge funds was done [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1964.52s)]
*  That they violated securities law there when they were trying to quickly to sophisticated investors. I just looking at it logically [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1971.3s)]
*  You would think it was the reverse [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1977.54s)]
*  But this is a fascinating turn of events. I just texted with Brad Garlinghouse and he says [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1979.34s)]
*  Yes, it does mean that they won and he feels vindicated vindicated and really happy [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1984.8600000000001s)]
*  About the you feel Jake how well I feel like I'm gonna launch jcoin and sell a token to back startups [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1993.34s)]
*  I mean if if it's a free for all I won't tell you tell you what he said [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=1999.9s)]
*  No, I mean [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2004.98s)]
*  These guys have security fraud for like I think it is [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2007.18s)]
*  They've been convicted of securities fraud here, so that's the it's a two-part judgment [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2010.1399999999999s)]
*  Ripple violated federal securities law and it's sale of cryptocurrency the first line of the story [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2014.8999999999999s)]
*  There's two judgments here. They violated federal securities on its sale of cryptocurrency XRP directly to sophisticated investors [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2019.3s)]
*  But the sales on public exchanges did not involve securities [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2025.4199999999998s)]
*  So what they're saying is if you sold XRP to hedge funds that was a security when they did the first offering [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2028.84s)]
*  But when the public started trading it on public exchanges [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2035.3s)]
*  They did not have according to the Howie test [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2038.98s)]
*  This belief but that's where their vulnerability was because if you sell to a professional hedge fund, they're accredited [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2042.14s)]
*  That should not be an issue. You should be able to sell to right? So what's the problem? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2048.74s)]
*  This is exactly for them. The judge says they sound pretty happy and the market seems to be indicating that this is [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2052.82s)]
*  I mean, would you say the price is up 35%? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2058.78s)]
*  Well, I mean [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2061.22s)]
*  37% right now crypto trades. I wouldn't necessarily put too much on it. I [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2063.3s)]
*  Would look at the the actual judgment here, but we all know people trade headlines [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2067.62s)]
*  So let's let's see where it's at in five days, but a bunch of the all coins are ripping right now. Oh [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2071.98s)]
*  Boy, here we go. It's a judgment that seems to indicate for a lot of folks that these are not going to be treated as securities [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2076.7400000000002s)]
*  I think that this is a really important [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2081.54s)]
*  Just think about how amazing the United States is that the government [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2084.26s)]
*  Agencies the administration in power can come after corporations [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2089.42s)]
*  And then we have a court system that can adjudicate and make decisions that follow the rule of law [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2093.38s)]
*  I know we're going to talk about Lena Khan and her agency's efforts at litigation [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2098.7000000000003s)]
*  But I'm really encouraged at the fact that the court system in the United States doesn't just kowtow to whatever [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2103.7400000000002s)]
*  administration is in power at that moment that they do adjudicate by the law and [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2112.02s)]
*  Ultimately provide greater clarity for business for individuals to operate going forward [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2116.82s)]
*  There is a better sense now for the market. There's a better sense now for individuals [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2122.64s)]
*  Our have they always a check in ballots, right? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2127.3199999999997s)]
*  I think that's what's so great is that there's now clarity because the courts provided that yeah has this trend changed [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2130.52s)]
*  I thought they thought America always did that. Yeah, I think it's great [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2136.44s)]
*  I think it's look cuz you have you obviously have a very zealous [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2139.8399999999997s)]
*  administration and a very zealous agency leader who is testing the boundaries and [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2144.16s)]
*  You know Lena Khan agency is pushing the limits on what constitutes antitrust and [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2148.84s)]
*  In the effort to try and push those boundaries. There is a pushback from the courts [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2154.96s)]
*  No, but in crypto, it's been Gensler in the SEC. It's been getting on. Yes. Sorry. Yeah, but but both agencies, right? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2159.2400000000002s)]
*  and [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2164.76s)]
*  So it's good to see that there's clarity emerging and that the courts do their job and that the administration's come in [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2165.56s)]
*  I think the Lena Khan thing is yeah very different [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2171.2s)]
*  I think this was a nuanced argument that the SEC made that required a highly sophisticated [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2174.0s)]
*  Interpretation of securities law and you're supposed to go to the courts for that. I [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2179.92s)]
*  Think what the FTC has been doing is basically [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2185.28s)]
*  Just emotionally reactive lawsuit filing. All right [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2190.28s)]
*  So let me just pivot over to Lena Khan's losing shriek here on Tuesday morning [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2193.84s)]
*  A federal judge denied the FTC's attempt to delay Microsoft 70 billion dollar acquisition of [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2197.88s)]
*  Activision Blizzard and the FTC's arguments basically Microsoft should not be allowed to acquire Activision because it would make Activision score assets [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2203.0s)]
*  Which is basically Call of Duty one of the greatest franchises in the history of franchises [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2209.28s)]
*  movies or [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2214.88s)]
*  television shows or video games and that it would be [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2216.64s)]
*  Exclusive to the Xbox Satya Nadella and Xbox head Phil Spencer both said under oath [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2220.0s)]
*  They could not make COD an exclusive and they wouldn't and not only that they said they would allow it [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2224.52s)]
*  Made no sense. I mean they also said they would put it on Nintendo [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2230.2s)]
*  Of course because I'm going to Sony because Nintendo and Sony are the other number one and number two players in this market [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2233.96s)]
*  And Sony alone is basically 50% of the market [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2240.98s)]
*  So I think like the crazy thing about all of this is if you look at [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2243.74s)]
*  the the legal strategy of [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2249.7599999999998s)]
*  the FTC [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2252.68s)]
*  it's basically that they view themselves as a hammer and [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2254.16s)]
*  Every deal particularly if it's done by big tech is a nail and so, you know Amazon Roomba [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2258.8s)]
*  lawsuit [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2265.72s)]
*  Facebook some rando little company lawsuit [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2266.76s)]
*  Microsoft Activision lawsuit and it's that [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2270.72s)]
*  emotional reactivity [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2273.88s)]
*  That takes away [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2276.04s)]
*  faith and trust that this organization is intelligent and [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2278.52s)]
*  Sober and well-run and that's the shame of it [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2282.88s)]
*  Because if you actually look across all of the deals in tech that have happened recently [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2286.6s)]
*  This deal was frankly do away from the start from a regulatory blocking perspective because of what I just said [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2290.92s)]
*  The number three player a distant third [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2298.04s)]
*  Buying an asset. Why would you take an asset that you pay 70 billion dollars for and immediately turn it off from 50% of all [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2301.36s)]
*  Consoles nobody would do that. Hey Sax when we look at this [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2308.32s)]
*  And let's widen this aperture to the faith in institutions because we have the Gary Gensler [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2311.84s)]
*  Hey, do we actually believe that they're acting in good faith or are they trying to protect fiat currency and [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2317.44s)]
*  not let an alternative currency take some control and [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2323.8s)]
*  Sort of be a backstop against their behavior and the money printing machine, which is cryptos [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2328.2400000000002s)]
*  You know big sort of let's call it the biology position and then in this case Lena Khan was selected hand-picked as a [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2331.92s)]
*  32 year old wonder kid [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2339.8s)]
*  Who had this incredible visas that she could predict who would compete in the future? [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2341.68s)]
*  She was like a minority report free con she alone could decide [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2345.96s)]
*  You know who how these competitions would emerge and she keeps losing [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2350.36s)]
*  So these two institutions now being used for political purposes [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2355.56s)]
*  by the Biden administration or do you think that they're just [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2360.24s)]
*  poorly executing what's your take [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2364.56s)]
*  Well, I think clearly the legal strategy that Lena Khan has been pursuing is not having much success in the courts [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2367.56s)]
*  I mean she just lost this big decision on the Microsoft acquisition of Activision, but that being said [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2374.24s)]
*  I'm almost starting to feel bad for her because although some of her legal theories may be flawed [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2380.36s)]
*  I do think that these big tech companies like Google and Microsoft do need a check on their power [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2385.32s)]
*  And so what I would urge is that Lena Khan needs to regroup [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2390.12s)]
*  Maybe figure out a different legal strategy [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2394.88s)]
*  Figure out a different way to take on big tech because someone does need to cut these big tech companies down to size [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2397.72s)]
*  They are giant monopolies and they do need to be restrained and controlled or they will basically [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2403.64s)]
*  Consolidate the whole tech ecosystem and abuse their market power [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2409.16s)]
*  So I think it's actually pretty vital that we have a regulator who is energetic in wanting to check the power of big tech [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2412.36s)]
*  I think maybe [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2419.72s)]
*  Trying to put a damper on M&A was the wrong way to do it [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2421.9199999999996s)]
*  We've talked about this before needs to be more surgical [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2424.9199999999996s)]
*  right [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2427.3599999999997s)]
*  There's so few ways to have a good exit in the tech industry that when you take away M&A it puts a damper on all [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2427.56s)]
*  risk-taking and deployment of risk capital into the ecosystem [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2435.08s)]
*  so I think it was having too big of a chilling effect, so I think she needs to [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2438.6s)]
*  move away from [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2443.48s)]
*  These M&A cases unless it's a very very clear case [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2445.3599999999997s)]
*  But I think where she can be more aggressive is on restraining anti-competitive tactics and also maybe busting up these companies [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2449.48s)]
*  You know, I'm thinking more and more about this Google case that she has where she wants to basically break up the company [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2456.92s)]
*  Because they've got this monopoly not just in search but also in [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2462.56s)]
*  Advertising maybe that's a good thing and maybe Amazon should have to spin out AWS [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2466.68s)]
*  Maybe Google should have to spin out YouTube because I do think they are [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2471.16s)]
*  Abusive in the way they exercise their authority as a small example over the past week [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2475.44s)]
*  YouTube just banned a video of Jordan Peterson [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2481.72s)]
*  interviewing [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2486.44s)]
*  RFK jr. Why? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2488.4s)]
*  What gives them the power to interfere in our democracy that way where they just decide for their own reasons? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2490.72s)]
*  That the public can't watch a video of Jordan Peterson interviewing RFK [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2497.7599999999998s)]
*  When the [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2502.4s)]
*  Supreme Court just say private companies can serve customers however they want if you want a gay cake [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2504.4s)]
*  You got a baker who doesn't have to make it isn't the same [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2509.36s)]
*  Analogy. No, I don't think it's the same principle. These are huge monopolies that have tremendous market power that are [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2512.28s)]
*  Companies can choose their customers and products, but the big company has a more of a responsibility to be an open platform in your mind [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2517.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's the common carrier argument [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2525.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, my point is just they have tremendous market power that they abuse in arbitrary ways [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2527.1600000000003s)]
*  You have to admit sacks there her lawsuit strategy is scattershot [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2531.84s)]
*  It's a little bit spraying prey in fairness to her [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2535.5600000000004s)]
*  She said she was gonna do that for example, like but where is the I agree? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2538.52s)]
*  We like where's the lawsuit on Adobe Figma that seems like a more obvious one. You have the number one and the number two, right? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2542.2000000000003s)]
*  There's a clear number one monopoly buying the number two [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2548.4s)]
*  And so that could be more market consolidation than a number three player buying [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2550.84s)]
*  Nobody that the public doesn't know those names and Biden put her in there to be anti-tech [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2555.88s)]
*  But I think I [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2560.7599999999998s)]
*  Her but no, I just want to tell you her position has also been driven by wealth inequality [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2563.44s)]
*  Which is not the mandate of the FTC. I think that's why she's the worst modern-day FTC head. I'll say it again [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2567.88s)]
*  Because she should be looking at tactics and the tactic she should do is the app store on [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2575.48s)]
*  IOS should be open to other app stores [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2581.56s)]
*  Amazon you know is open to third-party sellers [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2585.08s)]
*  They should be looking at the bundling of Microsoft of teams and say you know what because you have a monopoly position [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2588.2799999999997s)]
*  You can't add things to the bundle without charging for them [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2592.8799999999997s)]
*  So if you want to include Microsoft teams [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2595.72s)]
*  You got to put a price on it and the price has to be a fair market price because you're doing [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2597.4399999999996s)]
*  Product dumping you're dumping into the market a free product with your market position [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2602.12s)]
*  Instead when they launch that the settlement should be Microsoft teams should be plus eight dollars per month per person plus four dollars [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2607.4399999999996s)]
*  But she shouldn't be allowed to dump products onto the market. I think the tactical stuff [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2613.8599999999997s)]
*  That got a response okay free Berg first Chamath Sachs [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2620.7s)]
*  Freeberg I'm just asking why like why wouldn't it be okay for Microsoft to put a cheap product out if someone makes an alternative to [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2623.9399999999996s)]
*  Teams that is a better product with more features and they charge for it and people are willing to pay for it [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2630.8199999999997s)]
*  They'll win in the mark because of bundling bundling and product dumping is illegal according to the F the laws in the United States [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2635.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, I'm asking you think that I agree with that [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2642.62s)]
*  Yeah, it's a form of bundling you got to make that argument. But yes, I agree with that [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2644.82s)]
*  But look the way I judge these things is what is good for the ultimate health of the startup ecosystem [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2649.42s)]
*  Because entrepreneurship is the thing that we should be optimizing for not the power or wealth of big companies [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2655.6600000000003s)]
*  But the vibrancy and dynamism of the star ecosystem as a whole [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2661.1800000000003s)]
*  So I think that long term that's what leads to the creation of new big companies. That's what's good for America at cosine [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2666.46s)]
*  Yes, so with FTC, I think Lena con hasn't gotten the formula, right? [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2671.7599999999998s)]
*  I think she's challenging some of the wrong M&A deals [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2676.12s)]
*  but like I said [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2678.48s)]
*  I'd like to see her regroup and [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2679.24s)]
*  Figure out how to take on these big companies because I do think they have to be restrained on the other hand what's happening with? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2680.98s)]
*  SEC and operation choke point is I think they would have basically put the kibosh on the whole crypto ecosystem [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2686.92s)]
*  I mean if you basically come out and say that there's no such thing as a token that every single [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2694.88s)]
*  Token is basically a security then that's the end of crypto as a potential [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2701.12s)]
*  Center of innovation now we can argue about what the utility of it is [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2706.8s)]
*  We can argue about whether there's long term gonna be anything there [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2710.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't really know for sure [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2713.44s)]
*  But I would like the United States to be the place where we figured this out not driving it [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2715.04s)]
*  Overseas so I'm happy that the judge found in favor of ripple without knowing anything [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2719.6s)]
*  Specifically about what ripple did and I'm not endorsing their behavior or tactics or whatever [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2724.8s)]
*  But I'm happy that there is now a precedent that says that you can have a token like XRP [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2729.8s)]
*  That is not a security because that is going to enable more innovation in the ecosystem because it was really going the other way [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2736.28s)]
*  before and [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2742.32s)]
*  My critique of what the SEC was doing is they were basically seizing power that they did not have I mean basically Gensler [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2743.52s)]
*  Unilaterally was telling Americans that they cannot hold or buy or trade crypto because when you say that [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2751.5600000000004s)]
*  Every tokens of security and they can't operate on exchanges [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2758.56s)]
*  You're basically saying that Americans don't have the right to engage in crypto [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2762.8s)]
*  And I think that was basically a bridge too far to mouth you wanted to get in on that [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2765.84s)]
*  well, I just think that part of the thing that I [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2770.48s)]
*  Think maybe the FTC suffers from is that being a con is a very young academic and maybe [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2774.0s)]
*  What we need? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2780.48s)]
*  to have a little bit more of [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2782.32s)]
*  A higher batting average or slugging percentage here is just actually have somebody that understands how business works [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2784.8s)]
*  Because I think this scattershot approach doesn't do much and I think it just wastes taxpayer money by funding these [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2790.96s)]
*  Frivolous lawsuits that then sophisticated organizations like Microsoft and Metta just win. Yeah. And so where does it leave us? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2796.88s)]
*  It weakens the institution. It makes the laws [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2803.6800000000003s)]
*  frankly not enforced where they need to be and [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2807.7200000000003s)]
*  The whole point is not a marketing exercise or a PR exercise to go after companies you dislike [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2810.68s)]
*  But to actually enforce the laws of capitalism and market dynamism and so to not do that. I think is very [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2815.8s)]
*  Egotistical I think it's emotional and I think it sets the US back because the things that should get stopped don't and [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2823.2400000000002s)]
*  Then all this other stuff is just a red herring and a waste of time and taxpayer money [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2831.0s)]
*  I think you're absolutely nailed it there. I think both of you know that sex and Chamath there [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2835.4s)]
*  I think she needs to focus on product dumping you can pull up the screenshot here [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2839.32s)]
*  Predatory or below-cost pricing is well within the FTC's mandate [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2843.84s)]
*  You can go look up just type in predator or below-cost pricing FTC and you can read all about it [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2847.46s)]
*  It's absolutely clear that you cannot put products out there at a lower price [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2851.84s)]
*  And so you have to have a granular discussion is teams Microsoft teams a product or a feature [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2857.26s)]
*  I think we all know it's a product and so that's an easy win for her interoperability [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2862.44s)]
*  Should Android people be not allowed to use iMessage [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2867.88s)]
*  Should people on iOS not be able to use the Play Store or buy digital good assets from Amazon? Obviously [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2871.44s)]
*  Apple should be stopped there. So interoperability and [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2878.08s)]
*  Then there's one that's a such a clear easy layup for her and you know, we'd all like to see her succeed [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2881.2400000000002s)]
*  But I think she is absolutely doing Biden's bidding [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2886.7400000000002s)]
*  With an anti-tech anti wealth creation [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2889.68s)]
*  anti-capitalism frankly [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2893.2400000000002s)]
*  pro-union [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2895.0s)]
*  Punishment I think this is punishment for tech being too successful [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2896.2s)]
*  I don't think it's logical if you really want to get them go after dark patterns [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2899.3199999999997s)]
*  And if you don't know what dark patterns are that's when you subscribe for the Wall Street fucking journal [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2902.68s)]
*  online and then you have to call them to unsubscribe and [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2906.96s)]
*  There are so many dark patterns and I think Amazon's getting in trouble for this for prime [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2910.7999999999997s)]
*  one of the most loved products full time obviously but dark patterns could be stopped by the FTC and [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2915.64s)]
*  That's where they can really really do damage [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2920.7999999999997s)]
*  I heard today that they're investigating chat GPT for giving out wrong answers [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2923.44s)]
*  It says right on it. It's gonna hallucinate and give you a wrong examples. This is an experiment another example of the FTC going after [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2928.2400000000002s)]
*  You know the wrong thing. So just I think she needs a sniper rifle not a shotgun [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2935.56s)]
*  She's got it. She needs to get a kill shot. Where's the kill shot coming from? [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2940.4s)]
*  Let's kill Google [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2945.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, yeah, that was pretty controversial when you said blow it up. I mean, I would love to hear you say more on that [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2947.4s)]
*  Yeah, well, I paraphrased a line from RFK jr [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2952.6s)]
*  Who is paraphrasing a line from JFK? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2955.98s)]
*  Which is you want to shout out the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter to the winds [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2958.08s)]
*  I said that after they banned the Jordan Peterson RFK interview that we should shatter Google into a thousand pieces and scatter to the [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2961.58s)]
*  Winds and that thing went massively viral [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2968.64s)]
*  There's a big part of this country that is really pissed at Google in the way they're exercising their arbitrary power [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2971.04s)]
*  How many did they get 12,000 likes? I just think that [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2976.16s)]
*  The people running that company I don't understand how they make these decisions just makes no sense [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2979.24s)]
*  I'll free Berg you work there. What are your thoughts on breaking up Google and how they make decisions? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2985.0s)]
*  Look I'm a [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2991.3599999999997s)]
*  Free market guy as you guys know, I think that consumers vote with their dollars and their eyeballs in their time [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2992.8199999999997s)]
*  and ultimately as [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=2999.8799999999997s)]
*  We see with Disneyland in Disney World if people don't like the behavior of a business [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3002.04s)]
*  They're gonna stop giving their time and their money to that business by the way free Berg [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3007.04s)]
*  Were you shocked at the fall off in traffic? I actually immediately thought I'm gonna take my kids to Disneyland [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3011.7200000000003s)]
*  Please Republicans stay home Disney hates you you guys know [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3020.12s)]
*  It's so expensive and I'm like man if I could [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3026.84s)]
*  Problem we have with you is that you're driving a 12 year old Audi that gets six miles to the gallon when you can [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3032.6400000000003s)]
*  Go to test a great car. I love the Audi RS7 [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3037.7200000000003s)]
*  A hole in the ozone you hypocrite and you're a hypocrite because you should you deserve that [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3042.12s)]
*  You deserve that. What is it $10,000 for the day to bring your kids to Disneyland VIP or you can do it [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3049.7200000000003s)]
*  So it just tires somebody in a wheelchair. It's ridiculous the the cost but yeah, you get to cut all the lines and everything [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3055.0s)]
*  Also, I generally don't love the crowds. So if it's gonna be less crowded, I'm more interested in taking my kids there [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3061.88s)]
*  It's already hard enough to deal with it, you know, so speaking of you know free Berg made this point about [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3066.84s)]
*  The administration being overzealous. Did you guys see this article on the glut of electric cars that are piling up now? [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3071.96s)]
*  Yeah on dealers lots. Yeah, we shift gears to this by the way [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3078.36s)]
*  I think this is a big part of what I said earlier about interest rates on car loans [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3081.88s)]
*  No, this is a this specific thing is more because of the bureaucracy of the government not allowing [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3085.56s)]
*  These credits to basically work across all different kinds of cars [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3090.6s)]
*  This this should not exist for the reason this is not a demand issue [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3094.3599999999997s)]
*  This is a shift here to the car bureaucracy. Yeah. Yeah government intervention and market dynamics. Is that the driver? Oh, yeah [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3097.56s)]
*  So axio so it says here [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3103.72s)]
*  The legacy auto industry is beginning to crank out more evs to challenge tesla, but there's one big problem [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3106.68s)]
*  Not enough buyers. There's a growing mismatch between ev supply and demand [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3111.64s)]
*  Even though consumers are showing more interest in evs [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3116.92s)]
*  They're still worried about purchasing one because of either price or charging concerns range anxiety [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3119.16s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of these new companies that are they're not new companies, but they're new to evs don't have charging networks. Yep [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3126.76s)]
*  And that that's an issue and then also if you've never owned an ev [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3134.68s)]
*  And you don't live in a city because now we're going down the curve of people who live outside of cities [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3138.84s)]
*  And you see 200 mile range you remember your trip where you drove 300 miles or 400 miles and you're like well [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3143.72s)]
*  Then I can't have this car if you have a tesla you obviously can but then tesla also made the chess move of lowering their [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3149.0s)]
*  Prices and having record sales so their margin went down [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3154.3599999999997s)]
*  But their sales went up and everybody can wait a year like that's I think [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3157.56s)]
*  That what people don't realize about cars you can always get another year out of your current car. So according to this article [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3162.04s)]
*  The nationwide supply of evs in stock has grown nearly 350 percent this year to more than 92 000 units [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3168.76s)]
*  Which is a 92 day supply [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3177.0800000000004s)]
*  Of evs whereas by comparison dealers have 54 days worth of gasoline powered cars in inventory [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3180.1200000000003s)]
*  So even though interest [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3187.96s)]
*  Is growing in evs. They're simply [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3190.6000000000004s)]
*  Too much supply too much supply [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3193.7200000000003s)]
*  It's because all these other companies like ford and ge are now producing tons of evs [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3196.2799999999997s)]
*  But they don't have the charging networks and they're new to the ev game and they don't really [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3201.72s)]
*  Produce great cars great evs [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3206.2799999999997s)]
*  tesla does not have this problem by the way, and what I come back to is just the administration's industrial policy, I mean the [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3208.7599999999998s)]
*  Administration just gave all these subsidies and credits [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3215.64s)]
*  To big companies like ford and ge to make evs, but no one wants those cars. Yep [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3218.9199999999996s)]
*  By the other problem and so they're actually interfering in a free market where [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3225.8799999999997s)]
*  tesla [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3230.7599999999998s)]
*  Is the big winner because they took a huge risk and created a product people wanted and now you've got these big stodgy old [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3232.12s)]
*  Companies trying to catch up but no one wants their cars and the administration which is pro-union is anti-tesla because they don't have a union [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3237.8799999999997s)]
*  And so they put the thumb on the scale and give them [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3245.72s)]
*  The credits instead of giving the credits to tesla although tesla lowered their prices and I think they now qualify [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3248.3599999999997s)]
*  But the prices are so low for tesla and the cars are so sophisticated listen not to talk up our guy's book, but [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3253.4s)]
*  I think the other big issue here that's not mentioned the story is [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3259.8s)]
*  Interest rates. I mean if if you could give these things away at two percent three percent four percent interest rates [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3262.84s)]
*  That's a big difference, isn't it? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3268.04s)]
*  in terms of monthly car payment eighty percent of new cars are [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3270.28s)]
*  Financed okay, so that's the beginning and end of this probably [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3275.96s)]
*  I mean, it's three factors going on and interest rates on auto loans have doubled like the chart has showed so [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3278.92s)]
*  You know, it's it's a huge impact on demand overall and it's not you know [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3283.8s)]
*  If you know the adoption curve of technology [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3287.96s)]
*  I think we're getting into the big middle the fat middle and then going to the laggards and the laggards want [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3290.04s)]
*  An f-150 or a cyber truck and until those emerge or a suburban that's electric [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3295.1600000000003s)]
*  You know three rows with a lot of storage those those don't exist yet [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3300.52s)]
*  All right, so jake, let me ask you a question. Okay, so you've got an administration [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3305.4s)]
*  That is overzealous as freeberg said on industrial policy basically subsidizing these like old stodgy broken companies [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3309.64s)]
*  Like ford at the expense of innovators like tesla [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3317.4s)]
*  They are bringing a bunch of anti-mna ftc lawsuits that you don't like. Nope. They are [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3320.2s)]
*  Cracking down on crypto which you may like but in an overly aggressive way the course is throwing that out [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3327.32s)]
*  I would like to have the rules fair [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3333.0s)]
*  Let me just finish saying this out. Keep going. Yeah, we've just gotten off of a [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3335.08s)]
*  One to two year spike in inflation caused by runaway deficit spending and over stimulus [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3339.8s)]
*  so my question to you is [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3346.44s)]
*  Is the economy doing so well because of or in spite of this administration? I think it's uh [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3348.84s)]
*  Innovators and consumers drive the economy [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3355.54s)]
*  I [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3358.36s)]
*  Think I voted for biden and uh over trump because I think trump would have [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3359.4s)]
*  Stolen the election and as a treasonous [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3364.04s)]
*  felonious [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3367.2400000000002s)]
*  horrible human being [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3368.76s)]
*  and I thought it was existential crisis for america now if you could put up a republican candidate like chris christy who I just uh [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3370.52s)]
*  Much scar moochie just put me in touch with chris christy. He's coming on the show [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3376.52s)]

*  If chris chris i'm gonna vote for chris christy, I think [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3391.16s)]
*  I think you changed the subject. I wasn't asking you about I mean I i i was asking you about whether you think [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3394.6s)]
*  the administration is helping the economy or [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3400.44s)]
*  hurting the economy [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3403.32s)]
*  I think the runaway spending to freeberg's point last year is [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3405.48s)]
*  Made me a single issue voter [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3409.96s)]
*  And I think that their spending disqualifies them for me voting for them [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3412.2s)]
*  I need somebody who's going to balance the budget or get this spending. I love you now. Oh my god [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3416.12s)]
*  No, I mean I can agree with you on some things i'm like hans solo. You're like c3po [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3420.36s)]
*  I need you to navigate an asteroid field, but I need you to also just shut the fuck up when i'm doing it [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3424.44s)]
*  Okay, so just let me cook as the world's greatest moderator [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3429.0s)]
*  Now I do agree with you on this you're you're absolutely correct [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3432.44s)]
*  If we don't get the balance sheet right nothing else matters [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3435.56s)]
*  And I don't think trump's crazy spending and biden's crazy spending is not going to get us out of this [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3438.28s)]
*  We need somebody to control spending a period full stop. I don't know how you where how are you guys feeling about the [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3443.64s)]
*  election at this point [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3449.3999999999996s)]
*  I guess we could just read that book the deficit myth. Okay, that book is the problem [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3451.16s)]
*  It's that we can always just issue money [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3456.44s)]
*  because [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3458.7599999999998s)]
*  We are the currency that everyone wants to hold [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3459.96s)]
*  And the flawed logic is that we are the currency that everyone wants to hold until we issue too much debt [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3463.56s)]
*  Yeah, we've rehashed this I mean the interest payments I think are the backstop chamath when we start hitting those interest payments [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3470.52s)]
*  People are going to start going. Uh, we're paying more in interest just like people with their home mortgages or like, you know [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3476.36s)]
*  I should have bought a smaller house because i'm paying so much in interest [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3481.08s)]
*  I should have bought a model three instead of a model x I I over I overspend [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3484.44s)]
*  So is that going to be the backstop for the united states itself? Is there any path of controlling spending? Is there any candidate? [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3489.6400000000003s)]
*  Who will get spending under control or is it just too unpopular? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3495.2400000000002s)]
*  RFK [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3497.7999999999997s)]
*  You think okay, and then the reason and the reason is because he's so against the military industrial complex [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3498.92s)]
*  And he wants to pass an executive order that bans [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3503.72s)]
*  Pharmaceutical advertising those things would have a pretty large ripple effect in the economy and in spending and in entitlements [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3506.9s)]
*  So it'd be interesting to let it play out [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3514.2s)]
*  All right, that's what you really care about [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3517.48s)]
*  Yeah, those things would be [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3519.48s)]
*  pretty meaningful changes [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3521.7999999999997s)]
*  Sax anything from you on any theory on how we could control spending in this country if there's any backstop i.e [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3524.04s)]
*  My theory when we start paying huge interest payments, maybe we get our act together [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3530.52s)]
*  Is there any candidate at the end of the day the market's probably going to impose discipline on us [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3534.92s)]
*  That's sort of my point. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. The cost of borrowing will become so [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3539.1600000000003s)]
*  painful that is the argument that larry summers and other [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3543.7200000000003s)]
*  contrarian economists contrary into the [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3546.82s)]
*  Uh administrations policy have been making i'm sorry, I don't want to put that in his mouth, but [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3548.9s)]
*  That the cost of borrowing is going to be high as long as spending remains high [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3554.9s)]
*  And so when you see security and climate transition [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3559.3s)]
*  Type and simulatory spending going on chips act ira all this sort of stuff. It's not cost-free. You have to pay more [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3562.42s)]
*  To the buyers of your debt. Yeah, I mean chumoth can speak to this [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3570.5s)]
*  The vig, you know, it's always if you replace a lot of bets the vig doesn't go down it goes up when the debt goes up [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3575.3s)]
*  So anyway just on the market imposing [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3580.7400000000002s)]
*  Discipline on the federal government, you know [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3583.84s)]
*  one of the things we've talked about is whether there could ever be an alternative reserve currency and [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3586.9s)]
*  The theory was that as problematic as the u.s fiscal situation is there's no real alternative to the u.s dollar [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3592.26s)]
*  The bricks countries are about to introduce an alternative currency. That's based on gold [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3597.86s)]
*  So it seems like what the bricks countries would like to do [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3604.18s)]
*  Is use gold go back to the gold standard gold certificates [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3607.2200000000003s)]
*  as an alternative that's basically what we're talking about so [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3611.94s)]
*  It's announced they're going to be rolling this out. We haven't yet seen how or what the details are going to be [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3615.78s)]
*  but [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3620.7400000000002s)]
*  That's scarce to be built into it [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3621.62s)]
*  That would be the alternative as you go back to a gold standard and the bricks countries move to that [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3624.26s)]
*  Now, I know a lot of people may not [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3629.2200000000003s)]
*  Think that's much of a threat, but I was reading actually some really interesting articles [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3631.7799999999997s)]
*  About how big the bricks countries are now and if you look at them on a purchasing power parity basis [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3636.4199999999996s)]
*  the bricks countries just surpassed the g7 [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3642.3399999999997s)]
*  in terms of gdp [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3646.8199999999997s)]
*  So if you if you measure the size of their economies based on exchange rates, then the g7 is still bigger [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3648.8199999999997s)]
*  But if you look at in terms of ppp [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3655.9399999999996s)]
*  Actually, the bricks are now bigger than the g7 and growing faster just and then for people who are catching up brazil russia india china [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3658.66s)]
*  And other what are considered emerging markets but are quickly becoming yeah brazil russia india china bricks [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3667.46s)]
*  And there's a bunch more who want to join with this ripple ruling [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3675.3s)]
*  I think this becomes a boon for people to say well the scarcity of [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3678.9s)]
*  bitcoin [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3682.56s)]
*  And bitcoin's stability, I think where it's trading right around 30k between the 10k previous average and the 60k peak [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3684.02s)]
*  Maybe that becomes the gold standard in the future and it you know [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3691.7000000000003s)]
*  If people can feel a little bit more secure in it [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3695.78s)]
*  Now are we going to see like 10 counter lawsuits and everybody is just going to sue the sec and stand up for themselves [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3698.98s)]
*  I think that's what's going to happen now if ripple wins this or you know, if this ripple thing does work out appeals, whatever [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3704.58s)]
*  Then for sure standard [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3710.58s)]
*  Yeah, all the all coins are fighting no settlements and I think that's what mna is going to happen all mna [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3712.58s)]
*  It's like well now the settlement is off the table. We're going to fight [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3719.54s)]
*  And you know what you can afford a lot of lawyers if you sold a lot of tokens or you're a big money printing machine [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3723.7000000000003s)]

*  The fifth element red meat for sax and for jay cal to a certain extent [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3897.06s)]
*  There are no winners in war nato has brought sweden and obviously finland came in right before them because of putin's invasion of [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3901.62s)]
*  ukraine and [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3909.7799999999997s)]
*  Here we go. Zalinski denounced the nato alliance's administration policy as absurd and disrespectful first sentence of [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3911.14s)]
*  sax's very long tweet storm despite biden's best efforts to put a happy face on it vilnius will be remembered as the nato summit where [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3919.94s)]
*  Tensions boiled over obviously, uh, this photo has become a bit of a meme [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3926.66s)]
*  Throw it up on the screen right here. Zalinski [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3932.9s)]
*  Literally, not figuratively having nato turn his back on him on stage from being the cause celeb last year [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3935.62s)]
*  To everybody I you know, and again, it's it's just a picture. Uh [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3942.42s)]
*  There was a obviously a press conference with biden who said zalinski was stuck with the u.s and uh, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3946.74s)]
*  I'll let sax take it from there. These nato meetings are supposed to be [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3953.3799999999997s)]
*  symbols of unity and harmony and the alliance coming together to show how on the same page they are [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3958.5s)]
*  and this meeting [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3965.54s)]
*  It sort of ended up there, but it's not the way it started [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3967.8599999999997s)]
*  Zalinski had been told the ukrainians had been told before the summit that there would not be a timetable for their [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3972.24s)]
*  Admission to nato on the agenda stoltenberg had said it weeks ago biden had said it weeks ago [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3978.8999999999996s)]
*  This controversy had played out already in the pages of the new york times and other publications. So he knew [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3984.02s)]
*  That it would not be on the agenda and yet he went into the meeting demanding that they put it on the agenda trying to muscle [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3990.2599999999998s)]
*  his way [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3997.06s)]
*  into admission into nato which biden I think to his credit has resisted because biden understands that this is an escalation that could lead to [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=3998.2599999999998s)]
*  World war three as biden explained [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4005.94s)]
*  The members of nato have an article five commitment to defend each other's territories. So if ukraine is admitted to nato [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4009.54s)]
*  Then we would end up being directly involved in this war or at least that's the risk and so [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4016.34s)]
*  Biden's position is that the alliance will admit ukraine [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4022.42s)]
*  At some point in the future when the conditions have been met [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4026.9s)]
*  And that wasn't good enough for zalinski and he basically threw a diplomatic tantrum. Why? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4030.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean do you want to explain from his point of view? I mean, yeah [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4035.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm curious what you would think his why would he do something like that is I guess my question [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4037.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think there's a couple of different reasons. Okay, so [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4041.22s)]
*  I think the less positive explanation [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4044.58s)]
*  Is that his sense of entitlement has reached incredible proportions? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4047.8599999999997s)]
*  That you had here the entire [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4053.54s)]
*  West and especially the western media has been fawning over him for a year [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4056.9s)]
*  the west has given over 100 billion dollars and [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4060.98s)]
*  He just feels entitled to more and more aid and I think that really rubbed [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4064.98s)]
*  The attendees the wrong way you had ben wallace who's the secretary of defense for the uk? [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4070.02s)]
*  Basically chastised zalinski for his ingratitude and just so you understand. I mean ben wallace is a super hawk. He is [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4074.98s)]
*  super pro ukraine [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4082.26s)]
*  and [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4083.86s)]
*  If he had his way we might even be directly involved in the fighting biden actually vetoed [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4084.9s)]
*  Ben wallace becoming the new head of nato. That's why stolen berg on another year [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4089.3s)]
*  So you probably got one of the most hawkish members [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4093.7799999999997s)]
*  of this club [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4097.94s)]
*  Reprimanding zalinski for again this lack of gratitude basically to the alliance now, I think from zalinski's standpoint [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4100.16s)]
*  His view is that hey, we had a peace deal [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4108.5s)]
*  He didn't say this but this is my reading between the lines that we had a peace deal at istanbul [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4111.62s)]
*  We could have ended this war and you sent boris johnson to tell me we don't want to make a deal [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4117.46s)]
*  We want to pressure putin and we're going to give you the weapon systems to win this war [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4122.42s)]
*  That was the deal that he thought he was making and now it turns out that the u.s. Doesn't have enough [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4126.82s)]
*  Ammunition to give him i'm talking about the key type of ammunition in this war, which is artillery shells [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4132.16s)]
*  the u.s [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4137.54s)]
*  Has basically run out of 155 millimeter artillery shells, which are the [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4138.1s)]
*  Key type of ammunition that's used in these howitzers and these tanks and so forth [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4143.54s)]
*  And artillery is the main weapon being used in this war. It's what's creating most of the casualties [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4148.42s)]
*  So it must have come as a rude awakening to zalinski to find out that his partners [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4153.38s)]
*  Don't have enough ammunition to give him and i'm still [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4159.22s)]
*  stunned [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4162.580000000001s)]
*  That we spend over 800 billion a year [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4163.700000000001s)]
*  On defense and we could run out of ammunition. I mean, how does that happen? I mean how royally screwed [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4166.900000000001s)]
*  Is the american taxpayer when we spend 800 billion a year and we are out of ammunition already it is mind-boggling to me [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4173.620000000001s)]
*  Now the problem it's mind-boggling, right? I mean how incompetent has our military industrial complex become that this could even happen [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4180.34s)]
*  We need more competition startup. Shout out palmer lucky friend of the pot [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4188.02s)]
*  But no, sincerely, I mean, I know he hates you but I I do think that the solution is 10 more palmer luckies [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4193.06s)]
*  I mean, I think the silicon valleys [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4198.34s)]
*  Is anti supporting the military is a crazy position that needs to change and we should make more weapons [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4200.92s)]
*  And have vc back companies making weapon systems that are more affordable and and you know more advanced obviously [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4208.04s)]
*  This is actually not a case of needing some smart bomb or some super sophisticated [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4214.12s)]
*  This is basically just classic industrial production and we've hollowed out so much for our industrial production that we don't have the capability to scale up [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4220.2s)]
*  The manufacturing of these artillery shells is going to take us according to the pentagon [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4229.16s)]
*  They started the war at 14 000 shells being produced a month mainly for training purposes [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4233.24s)]
*  They've scaled that to somewhere between 20 and 30 000 a month now [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4238.28s)]
*  And they're saying that they will get to about 90 000 [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4241.96s)]
*  In somewhere between 20 25 and 20 28. Yeah, we have three percent on employment. You're talking about earlier [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4245.799999999999s)]
*  You're talking about multiple years. Who's going to work in these factories, right? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4251.48s)]
*  It's going to take multiple years to scale up these [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4254.36s)]
*  Factories, but sax who's going to work in these factories? We're at three percent unemployment like we don't have factory workers in this country [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4256.44s)]
*  We have to let them in we're going to need more immigrants. That's not the limiting factor here [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4262.28s)]
*  But if you're wondering why did the u.s give cluster bombs? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4267.56s)]
*  To ukraine it's because we're out of ammo to give [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4271.72s)]
*  And it's all we've got left are these stockpiles of cluster munitions. That is why the united states is violating [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4275.56s)]
*  International law a treaty that we haven't signed but 120 other countries have signed not to [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4282.42s)]
*  Use cluster munitions and yet we are giving them to [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4289.0s)]
*  ukraine because according to both biden and jake sullivan we are out [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4292.68s)]
*  You think we shouldn't give them the cluster bombs that's your position. Well, I wouldn't have put ourselves in this position [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4298.2s)]
*  I mean we're in a terrible position. Would you give them or not? No, I think it's degrading to america's moral authority to be [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4302.4400000000005s)]
*  Violating international law to be using and endorsing cluster munitions, but we put ourselves in this situation [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4308.360000000001s)]
*  The counter to that of course is russia's using them on ukraine soil. This is ukraine soil [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4314.52s)]
*  Don't they have the right to defend themselves and use the same weapons that the invader is using? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4320.84s)]
*  That's disputed. It's known. Yeah, it is if the russians were using them, would you [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4324.52s)]
*  Think it would be fair for the ukraine [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4328.52s)]
*  Since they're being invaded the thing that I find curious about these accusations [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4331.0s)]
*  Is that when people talk about these examples of the russians using cluster munitions they talk about an example here or an example there [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4334.780000000001s)]
*  There are these isolated cases which doesn't sound right to me. It seems to me [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4342.62s)]
*  That if you're going to use cluster munitions, why won't you just use them at scale? [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4346.38s)]
*  That is what the ukrainians are going to be doing now because again, it's all we've got left to give them now [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4351.02s)]
*  What the russians have said is that in retaliation? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4354.860000000001s)]
*  They're going to start using cluster munitions at scale. So in regards of the truth of those allegations jason. Yeah [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4357.66s)]
*  It's an escalating this war. Yes, and the reason why invaded ukraine. So just the reason why 120 120 countries [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4363.900000000001s)]
*  Signed an agreement not to use cluster munitions because they linger [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4372.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's terrible on the battlefield long after and you have kids walking on them and civilians [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4376.38s)]
*  We're still cleaning them up in many locations around the world. They should be banned forever. Yeah, I agree [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4380.46s)]
*  Let me give get your take on this sax as we wrap up here on the sax red meat section and then go to science corner [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4385.18s)]
*  putin did what [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4390.54s)]
*  NATO couldn't do for decades, which is get finland and sweden who are famously independent like a lot of the nordics [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4392.62s)]
*  to join nato they both joined because of his [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4399.34s)]
*  invasion of ukraine [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4402.5199999999995s)]
*  And he's been very serious that if finland were to join or if sweden were to join [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4404.62s)]
*  That this would be a [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4410.14s)]
*  A trigger for him if military contingents and military infrastructure were deployed there [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4412.46s)]
*  We would be obliged to respond symmetrically and raise the same threats to those territories where [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4416.38s)]
*  Prets have risen for us. He's done nothing [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4421.660000000001s)]
*  Do you think that sweden and finland are? [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4425.02s)]
*  A huge l for him and do you think he'll have any kind of response to it? [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4428.06s)]
*  Do you think they should have been allowed in? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4431.58s)]
*  To nato I think it's an l for everybody [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4433.660000000001s)]
*  I mean we used to have an understanding that we'd have a buffer zone between russia [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4436.06s)]
*  And the west and that was good for everybody finland was neutral [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4441.9800000000005s)]
*  And I think it was good for finland. I mean during the entire cold war they were at much greater risk [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4445.820000000001s)]
*  Facing the soviet union on their border, which was a much more powerful a much more expansionist country than putin's russia has been [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4451.5s)]
*  even if you don't like putin's russia the [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4459.740000000001s)]
*  Soviet union was the evil empire. It was much worse in every dimension and finland managed to survive the cold war [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4462.22s)]
*  remaining neutral [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4468.46s)]
*  and so now you're right that [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4469.9800000000005s)]
*  I think this invasion of of ukraine has [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4472.46s)]
*  Ultimately caused finland and sweden to join nato, but we are now [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4475.660000000001s)]
*  Directly nato is going to be directly on their border staring eyeball to eyeball [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4480.54s)]
*  With nuclear weapons the russians have now moved nuclear weapons into belarus [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4485.179999999999s)]
*  So this is a ratching up of tensions that I think is not good for anybody who should get to decide [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4489.74s)]
*  Friedberg who joins nato nato the countries I want to join or russia [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4495.66s)]
*  What do you mean nato? I don't understand [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4501.5s)]
*  It's a pretty basic question. You know right now it's russia saying ukraine cannot join nato [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4504.62s)]
*  It's a line in the sand obviously finland and sweden just joined this year [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4509.18s)]
*  So i'm i'm curious your take on the nato alliance and if it's good for [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4513.58s)]
*  humanity [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4517.96s)]
*  I think look obviously this is a this is a different difficult calculus if you that's why i'm asking the question if nato wants to [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4519.34s)]
*  escalate [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4526.360000000001s)]
*  tensions with russia by [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4527.4800000000005s)]
*  Accepting ukraine. It's obviously going to require a significant [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4530.280000000001s)]
*  influx of capital by some estimates up to two trillion dollars [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4534.14s)]
*  To increase the security capacity of nato [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4538.400000000001s)]
*  Given the instigation that would arise from accepting ukraine into nato with russia [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4542.88s)]
*  so [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4548.08s)]
*  That is one path [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4549.4400000000005s)]
*  The other path is to not accept ukraine into nato [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4551.12s)]
*  And minimize the investment needed [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4555.12s)]
*  Reduce the escalatory cycle with russia to some degree for some period of time [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4557.92s)]
*  See where things go with ukraine and the conflict between russia and ukraine well said but not get actively involved [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4562.08s)]
*  So it's a difficult calculus. I think everyone wants to jump to some decision about what should be done here [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4567.36s)]
*  But this is a very hard decision very hard. What do you think about finland and sweden joining? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4572.32s)]
*  Uh, is it a is it a major win for nato in the west? Is it a major owl for russia somewhere in between? [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4576.4s)]
*  I don't really know. Yeah, I think that's as honest as you can get. Yeah, like I said, I think it's just sort of bad for everybody [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4581.679999999999s)]
*  but in the united states [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4587.839999999999s)]
*  Among the foreign policy establishment they tend to think that any country joining nato is an asset for us [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4590.08s)]
*  And I would argue that it's a liability because it requires the u.s to defend these countries [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4597.839999999999s)]
*  Again, if sweden or finland gets in a war [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4602.88s)]
*  We are making a guarantee to send american boys and girls to go defend that country [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4606.48s)]
*  Now they also make a guarantee to defend us, but realistically are we going to benefit does our security benefit by having sweden or finland? [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4612.0s)]
*  As an ally who's going to defend us no [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4620.32s)]
*  So every time you add a country to nato you're making a commitment [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4622.88s)]
*  For americans to have to go defend that country [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4627.36s)]
*  And I would argue that's a liability not an asset for america now, you know [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4630.96s)]
*  What's an asset for is a military industrial complex because all these countries when they join nato [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4634.88s)]
*  Agree to spend two percent of their gdp on defense [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4640.48s)]
*  And they can only spend that money on defense contractors who are interoperable with the nato platform, which is basically these approved western [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4644.719999999999s)]
*  contractors, so the defense industry loves nato expansion the military [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4652.139999999999s)]
*  They're locked into vendor lock absolutely. Oh, I didn't know there was vendor lock and that's like when you rent like, uh, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4657.679999999999s)]
*  You know a union hotel or something [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4663.44s)]
*  They're like you got to use wolfgang puck and it's uh, 800 [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4665.44s)]
*  a person for coffee one of the requirements for a country to join nato and ukraine already had [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4668.32s)]
*  Been on this path for the last few years. It's called interoperability [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4673.92s)]
*  You have to make your military interoperable with nato's which means that you use [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4678.32s)]
*  Weapons as well as tactics and strategies but weapons that are on the approved nato list [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4682.8s)]
*  And if you looked at the summit we just had in vilnius when all the planes came into the airport you had these [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4689.5199999999995s)]
*  Anti-aircraft batteries and howitzers and all these tanks all these weapons were being shown off [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4696.24s)]
*  By our defense contractors [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4702.639999999999s)]
*  At the nato summit. It was like a confab [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4704.88s)]
*  for the mic [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4707.5199999999995s)]
*  So you have to understand that nato is a business and the more countries that join nato [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4709.68s)]
*  The more money our defense contractors make [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4714.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and but that's the price of that for the average american is that our sons and daughters [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4717.040000000001s)]
*  One day might have to go defend these countries [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4723.040000000001s)]
*  and uh [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4726.240000000001s)]
*  It reduces the risk of russia going into another country would be the other steel man of it [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4727.52s)]
*  But let's go on to science corner. Everybody's favorite part of the show [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4732.0s)]
*  Is science corner? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4736.56s)]
*  Sax you can go use the bathroom and uh, chamath and I will be absolutely [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4738.64s)]
*  engaged [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4744.0s)]
*  In freeberg's science corner [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4745.360000000001s)]
*  Let's go we were talking about what to talk about as you guys know [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4747.92s)]
*  I said, hey we could talk about the sea surface temperatures in the atlantic [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4750.4800000000005s)]
*  That's likely going to drive the biggest hurricane season we've ever seen this coming season [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4753.6s)]
*  Super compelling good topic. We were going to talk about this minimal cell, but then just yesterday this paper was published which I think [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4757.6s)]
*  Deserves a lot of attention and we've talked about yamanaka factors and reprogramming cells, you know [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4765.52s)]
*  Adjusting the epigenetics of a cell to make it youthful basically reversing aging [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4772.0s)]
*  And you know a couple episodes ago [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4778.0s)]
*  I talked about how there's great proof and evidence now that aging is a result of degradation [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4779.52s)]
*  Or changes in the epigenome the little molecules that stick on top of the dna in a cell [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4786.08s)]
*  That decide what proteins are expressed that make that cell different from all the other cells the difference between an eye cell [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4791.5199999999995s)]
*  And a muscle cell in a skin cell is the epigenetics of that cell even though they all have the same dna in the nucleus [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4797.2s)]
*  And so the yamanaka factors these four chemicals that allowed the expression of these four specific genes [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4803.2s)]
*  Cause cells to become stem cells that can turn into any other cell the problem with applying yamanaka factors [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4809.04s)]
*  To reverse aging is that it turns the cells into cancer cells if you apply too much [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4815.92s)]
*  So then there were all these efforts on doing short bursts of yamanaka factors and more recently [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4820.48s)]
*  There's been an effort to do gene [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4826.0s)]
*  Insertions through viral vectors. You basically get a virus to deliver a gene into a cell [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4829.26s)]
*  That causes that cell to express some of the yamanaka factors that makes that cell more youthful [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4834.639999999999s)]
*  And there's actually clinical trials underway right now to apply this as a medicine for for vision loss [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4839.44s)]
*  Um where you can make the uh, the the retinal cells actually youthful. Yeah, really incredible [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4845.44s)]
*  So the the problem right now is that we don't really know how to target the cells how to provide the right amount of yamanaka factor [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4850.08s)]
*  stuff [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4856.08s)]
*  And how to get it there is that these gene expressing viruses or what do we do? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4857.2s)]
*  But this paper that was just published yesterday shows that you can use small molecules [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4860.8s)]
*  Basically small molecules are like advil or tylenol or you know, there's about 1800 molecules in a in a certain [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4865.76s)]
*  Reference library that's used in medicine [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4873.76s)]
*  And what this research team at harvard, um medical, um, and and some other facilities mit and other places [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4876.32s)]
*  In collaboration were able to do [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4883.92s)]
*  Is they basically did a screen a combinatorial screen? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4886.0s)]
*  So they took all these different molecules that are known to be used in medicine and they combined them together and created different cocktails [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4890.0s)]
*  They then took those cocktails and they applied them to the cells to see if they could reverse aging and in fact [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4896.96s)]
*  They found six different cocktails of small molecules that were able to have the same effect as we see [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4903.2s)]
*  With the yamanaka factors in short bursts to cause these cells to actually reverse their aging and become youthful again [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4909.679999999999s)]
*  I cannot overstate how important this is. This is probably the most [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4915.92s)]
*  Important trajectory of what's underway in biology since the discovery of dna this ability to actually make cells youthful again [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4919.9s)]
*  It can in fact ultimately result in a pill or a series of pills that can reverse aging [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4927.2s)]
*  That is why it is so exciting right now [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4933.2s)]
*  And we're seeing this data coming out from this research team and I have heard separately about data that has not yet been published [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4935.2s)]
*  By other research teams following the same track to do the same thing that it turns out [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4942.0s)]
*  It may in fact be possible to create pills with small molecules in it things that your body can absorb and end up in your bloodstream [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4947.44s)]
*  And go into different cells that actually rejuvenate the cells [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4953.84s)]
*  Fix the epigenetic data loss that happens in those cells causes them to become more youthful [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4957.12s)]
*  You could see a cream that you could apply to your skin that takes away wrinkles [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4962.0s)]
*  Ultimately, you could take something that makes your heart healthier your liver healthier [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4966.0s)]
*  And actually reverses aging in the individual cells by the absorption of these small molecules into those cells that ultimately [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4969.92s)]
*  Cause the expression of these genes and change all the transcriptome as it's called in the cell and makes it more youthful. It is unbelievable work [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4976.320000000001s)]
*  Everyone should be um, I think fascinated by this [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4984.08s)]
*  And where it's headed it is so exciting that there are multiple teams that are having breakthroughs on this work [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4987.280000000001s)]
*  That could ultimately translate into clinical trials [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4992.0s)]
*  Um and products that could be used by the obvious question. Can we get this to biden before the debates? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4994.72s)]
*  ooh [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=4999.52s)]
*  Hey, oh chamath your your uh, uranus joke, please come on. Sorry. Let me just step on your range [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=5000.88s)]
*  I'm so tired. I had such a big night last night [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=5006.4800000000005s)]
*  Man, he's like I can't even get a uranus joke up. I drank so much wine [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=5010.64s)]
*  I am [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TV3dNJGqGI&t=5014.8s)]
