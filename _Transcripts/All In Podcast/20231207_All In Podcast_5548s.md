# E156 Ivy League antisemitism, macro, SaaS recovery, Gemini, Figma deal delay + big Friedberg update
**All In Podcast:** [December 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk)
*  Saks, how are you doing with your Tucker afterglow? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=0.0s)]
*  It was an amazing episode. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3.18s)]
*  The feedback's been great. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4.68s)]
*  It's the number one episode of the year after Vivek, I think, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5.72s)]
*  and trending to be maybe a million views on YouTube. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=9.46s)]
*  So how's the afterglow? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=12.66s)]
*  Yeah, I did notice there's one particular clip that's [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=14.84s)]
*  going viral where he calls you stupid. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=17.46s)]
*  Yes, there's that one. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  Do you see that one? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=22.56s)]
*  I thought Tucker was incredible. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=23.26s)]
*  I found him so intellectually interesting. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=24.6s)]
*  And it's not always the case that great moderators [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=27.62s)]
*  and interviewers make great guests, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=31.38s)]
*  but he is so intellectually curious and has unique points [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=32.980000000000004s)]
*  of view that you want to hear them out. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=37.94s)]
*  And his style of talking I find also very easy to listen to. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=39.46s)]
*  I thought he was really impressive, really, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=45.28s)]
*  really impressive. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  You don't have to agree with everything he says, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=47.82s)]
*  quite honestly. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=49.86s)]
*  And some people probably won't, but I [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=51.019999999999996s)]
*  found him really compelling. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=53.58s)]
*  I don't agree with half of the stuff he said or maybe a third, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=55.14s)]
*  but I too enjoyed it very much. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=58.74s)]
*  I thought he was great. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=61.02s)]
*  Sax, as the person people believe [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=61.94s)]
*  has Trump derangement syndrome, thank you for your tweet, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=64.98s)]
*  or the person people consider the far left, they're like, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=68.42s)]
*  why aren't you pushing back? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=70.86s)]
*  Why aren't you pushing back? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=72.34s)]
*  And this has become a MAGA takeover. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=73.6s)]
*  You had Jared Kushner. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=75.38s)]
*  He didn't get pushed back. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=76.22s)]
*  He didn't get pushed back to Tucker. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=77.26s)]
*  One of the things we're trying to do here, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=79.22s)]
*  I'm speaking for myself, is to let people talk. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=80.88s)]
*  Let them put out their position. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=83.16s)]
*  If you do that, and we did that with the presidential candidates, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  exceptionally, I think, then you can decide for yourself. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=88.58s)]
*  And yes, we'll ask a hard question here or there, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=92.38s)]
*  or maybe push them a little bit, but we [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=94.82s)]
*  don't want to make it uncomfortable to come here [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=97.3s)]
*  and make it like they come here and we [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  take the 10 worst things about the person or the 10 criticisms [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=101.62s)]
*  and run through them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=104.89999999999999s)]
*  You can get that on cable news. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=105.74s)]
*  You can get that on either side of the aisle. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=106.97999999999999s)]
*  What I want to do is let them talk, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=109.06s)]
*  and then actually interesting things come up. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=111.3s)]
*  I do always get this feedback. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=113.14s)]
*  Because people perceive me, because you [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=115.06s)]
*  say I have Trump derangement syndrome, as the token left guy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=116.82000000000001s)]
*  That's all. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=119.3s)]
*  And I'm a moderate, and I try to keep saying that, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=119.98s)]
*  but people keep wanting to say I'm far left. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=121.62s)]
*  I just want folks to realize that we're going [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=123.9s)]
*  to go and have more guests, especially if we [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=126.06s)]
*  can learn from those folks. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  And especially if hearing them out [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=130.1s)]
*  can expand how we think about what's going on in the world. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=131.78s)]
*  So get over it, and it's about learning and being curious. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=135.1s)]
*  Hard conversations will be the norm here on the pod. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=139.9s)]
*  We're going to have any guests we damn well please. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=143.46s)]
*  And some people will choose to not ask hard questions. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  I will choose to ask hard questions, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=148.66000000000003s)]
*  but I won't hijack the show. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=150.42000000000002s)]
*  And so please don't email me and tell me [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=152.06s)]
*  I didn't do my job fighting for the left or whatever. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=154.22000000000003s)]
*  That's not my job. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=156.58s)]
*  I'm going to ask a hard question when I want to on the show, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  but I'm not going to hijack the show with 20. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=160.18s)]
*  Bravo to you. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=162.86s)]
*  I suspect you're getting a lot of pressure [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=163.62s)]
*  from the private equity wives. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=164.94000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=166.82000000000002s)]
*  What a great moment. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=169.34s)]
*  What a great moment. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=170.26s)]
*  People on SSRIs, Jason, are blowing up your inbox. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=171.22s)]
*  We'll let your winners ride. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=174.54s)]
*  Rain Man, David Sack. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=179.9s)]
*  I'm going all in. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=181.22s)]
*  And as said, we open source it to the fans, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=184.18s)]
*  and they've just gone crazy with it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=186.5s)]
*  Love you, Weston. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=188.1s)]
*  Queen of Kenwa. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=188.9s)]
*  I'm going all in. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=190.38s)]
*  Well, the conversation that everybody's going wild with, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  so let's just get into it, is these college [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=194.14000000000001s)]
*  anti-Semitism hearings. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=196.02s)]
*  On Tuesday, the House Education Committee [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=197.78s)]
*  spoke with the presidents of Harvard, Penn, MIT, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=199.86s)]
*  and they faced a lot of tough questions. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=204.18s)]
*  Many of the videos went viral. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=206.78s)]
*  And I guess the part that specifically went most viral [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=209.66s)]
*  was the presidents of these organizations [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=213.82s)]
*  refusing to specify whether or not [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=217.86s)]
*  the calls for mass murder of a particular group, genocide, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=219.86s)]
*  students were or were not against the codes of conduct [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=224.18s)]
*  against bullying and harassment at places like Harvard, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=227.54s)]
*  Claudine Gaye specifically was asked over and over again [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=229.82s)]
*  whether chants of Intifada were violations of Harvard's code [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=233.26s)]
*  of conduct. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=236.42s)]
*  She didn't give a great answer. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=237.78s)]
*  I'm just curious, Sacks. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=239.06s)]
*  Obviously, you're Jewish. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=240.85999999999999s)]
*  You went to the Ivy League. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=241.94s)]
*  Passionate about free speech. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=243.34s)]
*  And you've talked about surplus of the Jewish politics. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=245.78s)]
*  He is. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=249.94s)]
*  What's your take here? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=250.98s)]
*  Should students be allowed to march around campus, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=252.34s)]
*  chanting from the river to the sea, Intifada, et cetera, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=255.74s)]
*  because of free speech? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=260.5s)]
*  Or did these code of conducts come into play? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=262.42s)]
*  And what was your reaction when you saw their answers? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=265.66s)]
*  Because obviously, this is a nuanced issue. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=267.82s)]
*  Well, look, I have a very high bar for free speech. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=269.62s)]
*  So I would allow almost everything. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=272.26s)]
*  The problem that these university presidents have [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=275.66s)]
*  is that's not their position. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=278.06s)]
*  They're trying to wrap themselves [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=279.3s)]
*  in the cloak of freedom of speech and academic freedom, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=280.42s)]
*  but that has not been their practice on campus [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=283.3s)]
*  for many years. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=285.66s)]
*  On a previous program, we talked about that fire survey, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=287.14s)]
*  which polled students about how free they feel [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=290.02000000000004s)]
*  to express opinions on campus. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=293.38s)]
*  The results were dismal for the Ivy League. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=295.94s)]
*  The Ivy League scored way worse than state schools. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=298.3s)]
*  And in fact, remember that Harvard got the blue Tarski [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=301.54s)]
*  a 0.0. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=304.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=305.5s)]
*  They were last place. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=306.3s)]
*  The students there reported that speakers were shouted down. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  They weren't even invited. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=313.62s)]
*  They weren't allowed to continue and finish their speeches. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=314.78s)]
*  So Harvard has an abysmal record on freedom of speech. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  So it's hard to believe the president of Harvard [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=321.7s)]
*  when she claims that she's standing up [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=324.94s)]
*  for freedom of speech. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=327.18s)]
*  And in fact, if you were to apply that same standard [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=328.02s)]
*  to other groups, do you really believe? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=331.5s)]
*  I mean, imagine if the representatives at that hearing [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=333.86s)]
*  had said to the president of Harvard, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=337.06s)]
*  are you allowed to advocate for genocide [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=339.9s)]
*  of black people or trans people? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=343.94s)]
*  I mean, would the answer have been the same? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=347.82s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=349.46s)]
*  I agree. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=350.5s)]
*  I think absolutely not. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=351.34s)]
*  So the question is, why are Jews being treated differently [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=352.34s)]
*  than these other groups? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=356.82s)]
*  And I think this all goes back to kind of woke identity [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=357.73999999999995s)]
*  politics, where in the woke ideology, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=362.17999999999995s)]
*  there are certain groups that are victim groups, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=365.17999999999995s)]
*  and there are certain groups that are oppressor groups. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=368.14000000000004s)]
*  And if you're in a victim group, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=370.58000000000004s)]
*  then you get special protections. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=373.58000000000004s)]
*  And if you're in an oppressor group, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=375.46000000000004s)]
*  then it's just assumed that you can't really suffer [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  discrimination or injustice in that same way. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=380.54s)]
*  And I think that Jews have basically been put [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=385.58000000000004s)]
*  in an oppressor group. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=389.58000000000004s)]
*  They basically are being put in the same group [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=391.58000000000004s)]
*  as all white people. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=393.34000000000003s)]
*  And I think this has come as a great surprise [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=395.5s)]
*  to a lot of donors to these university campuses, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=397.54s)]
*  who I think were okay with woke identity politics [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=401.66s)]
*  to some degree when they believed that Jewish people [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=405.26s)]
*  were a potential victim group, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=409.42s)]
*  and that antisemitism was being treated as real. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=412.46s)]
*  And lo and behold, they have found out that, no, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=416.14s)]
*  they're an oppressor group and they're not protected. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=418.66s)]
*  And even very explicit cases of antisemitism [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=421.34s)]
*  are not being recognized by these universities [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=425.9s)]
*  because, again, it doesn't match up with this woke ideology. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=428.02s)]
*  I think it would have been a lot better [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=432.85999999999996s)]
*  for a lot of these donors to realize [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=435.06s)]
*  that woke identity politics was a cul-de-sac. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=437.14s)]
*  It was something that they should not have wanted [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=441.09999999999997s)]
*  to participate in. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=443.7s)]
*  But I think they're now waking up to the realization [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=445.7s)]
*  that in this, again, oppressor, oppressed dichotomy, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=449.38s)]
*  they're on the wrong side of that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=454.98s)]
*  I think you're exactly- [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=456.46s)]
*  And they don't like that realization. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=457.7s)]
*  Exactly correct. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=459.02s)]
*  Identity politics, road to nowhere. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=459.94s)]
*  Freeberg, you gave a passionate speech here [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=462.14s)]
*  about being forced to pick a side [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=464.34s)]
*  when we're talking about the conflict in the Middle East. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=466.42s)]
*  And I guess there's underpinnings here of your discussion, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=470.21999999999997s)]
*  antisemitism, antisemitism, and where's the line [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=474.14s)]
*  between just caring about humans and children being killed [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=478.94s)]
*  versus maybe harassment, et cetera. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=482.38s)]
*  I'm curious when you saw these answers, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=485.86s)]
*  what was your reaction? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=489.18s)]
*  And yeah, how do you feel about it? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=490.3s)]
*  I was surprised that the Congress people [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=494.1s)]
*  didn't ask the university presidents, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=499.65999999999997s)]
*  what would your reaction be if they started to burn crosses [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=502.78s)]
*  and say something about white supremacy, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=508.29999999999995s)]
*  black people don't belong in the US, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=514.6999999999999s)]
*  immigrants don't belong in the US. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=518.6999999999999s)]
*  If you picked another ethnic group [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=520.5s)]
*  and made statements that have traditionally been deemed [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=522.5s)]
*  threatening and harassing, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=527.74s)]
*  would they have made a difference of judgment? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=529.9s)]
*  And if so, what's the difference [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=533.3399999999999s)]
*  between what's gone on in the US [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=535.38s)]
*  and what's gone on this week or in recent weeks [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=537.42s)]
*  and what's gone on in other civil rights actions [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=540.2199999999999s)]
*  that have taken place in educational institutions? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=545.54s)]
*  And I think that would have been like a really [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=549.74s)]
*  kind of telling understanding of the discernment [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=551.5s)]
*  that's being made on campus today versus in the past. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=555.18s)]
*  It is interesting to see that there's clearly [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=561.02s)]
*  a sense of being torn with respect to allowing [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=564.26s)]
*  the freedom of expression about groups that feel oppressed [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=568.54s)]
*  to be allowed to happen on campus [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=573.62s)]
*  because that is probably a majority opinion. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=577.1s)]
*  And that's why I think this is particularly difficult [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=580.34s)]
*  for these presidents to handle the situation. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=584.02s)]
*  And I'm not excusing their behavior or their actions [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=587.06s)]
*  or their comments yesterday, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=589.26s)]
*  but there's clearly something underlying this [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=591.2199999999999s)]
*  that I think we need to just acknowledge, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=595.14s)]
*  which is that there is a large number of people, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=597.8199999999999s)]
*  perhaps the majority of people, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=599.8599999999999s)]
*  that feel that there is some oppression going on [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=602.14s)]
*  and that that oppression has a right to be spoken for [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=604.54s)]
*  and that this behavior is the only way. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=608.2199999999999s)]
*  The Boston Tea Party did not follow convention. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=610.42s)]
*  The Boston Tea Party was a rebellion [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=613.38s)]
*  against an institution that was oppressive. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=616.26s)]
*  And the Boston Tea Party was the only action [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=619.26s)]
*  that was gonna make a change, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=621.5400000000001s)]
*  that could have driven a change. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=622.86s)]
*  And rebellion against an institution or an establishment [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=624.5s)]
*  that causes oppression isn't supposed to have rules. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=629.62s)]
*  It isn't supposed to follow convention. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=635.6600000000001s)]
*  It isn't supposed to be a discourse. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=637.38s)]
*  And so I think that that sentiment is where a lot [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=639.02s)]
*  of this conflict is coming from for the presidents [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=641.4200000000001s)]
*  in making these decisions, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=645.0600000000001s)]
*  that they see that the majority of people truly believe [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=646.1800000000001s)]
*  that there's oppression, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=649.9s)]
*  that this is the course to speak up for that oppression [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=650.9799999999999s)]
*  and that they can't step on that because if they did, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=653.26s)]
*  they would be causing more disruption to more people [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=656.06s)]
*  than allowing it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=659.14s)]
*  And it's a very difficult situation [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=659.9799999999999s)]
*  that they find themselves in. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=661.7399999999999s)]
*  So I'm not excusing it, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=662.8599999999999s)]
*  but I'm trying to frame up why I think [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=664.14s)]
*  otherwise smart people might be acting this way. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=667.7399999999999s)]
*  Frankly, I think it's worth asking, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=669.5799999999999s)]
*  what would be the case if this were other ethnic groups [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=671.18s)]
*  or other people that were being kind of, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=675.0999999999999s)]
*  told, hey, we're gonna have an intifada against X [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=678.9399999999999s)]
*  or Y or Z, would the actions have been the same? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=682.2199999999999s)]
*  Chabath, if they were asked that same question, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=685.14s)]
*  is calling for the genocide of black Americans, [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=687.66s)]
*  Asian Americans, Indian Americans, trans Americans, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=691.18s)]
*  harassment or bullying, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=696.3399999999999s)]
*  what do you think their answers would have been? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=698.78s)]
*  And then where do you think this is going? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=700.2199999999999s)]
*  I don't know what their answers would have been, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=701.62s)]
*  but obviously it's morally unacceptable. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=703.2199999999999s)]
*  As best as I can tell, they were coached by lawyers [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=705.74s)]
*  before they appeared in front of Congress. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=710.02s)]
*  And they found some verbal gymnastics maybe [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=713.54s)]
*  to try to defend their point of view. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=718.74s)]
*  And in it, they lost all moral clarity, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=721.9s)]
*  because to your point, Jason, and to Friedberg's point, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=724.62s)]
*  if you just replaced the Jewish people [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=727.3s)]
*  with any other cohort of people, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=729.82s)]
*  maybe in this moment, it was harder to see, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=733.54s)]
*  but these should not be debatable, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=736.7s)]
*  difficult moral questions. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=738.0600000000001s)]
*  So how did we get here? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=740.1400000000001s)]
*  I think that over the last 40 years, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=744.94s)]
*  and to be honest, it started when the US News [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=748.5s)]
*  and World Report started to rank universities. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=751.0600000000001s)]
*  They gamified the desire for these universities [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=757.5s)]
*  to get at the top of the list, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=763.58s)]
*  which allowed them to theoretically get better recruits, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=764.86s)]
*  but really what it did was allow them to build [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=768.1800000000001s)]
*  massive asset management businesses [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=771.22s)]
*  that ultimately consumed these schools. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=774.26s)]
*  And now what you find is that the learning process [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=778.22s)]
*  has gotten totally perverted, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=782.34s)]
*  because it became a second order priority [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=783.82s)]
*  to being able to raise money and to manage assets. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=787.1800000000001s)]
*  I think Harvard Management Company at one point [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=791.98s)]
*  was one of the largest owners of forestry in America. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=795.0600000000001s)]
*  The other large owner was John Malone, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=798.7s)]
*  a rapacious capitalist. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=801.1s)]
*  So what this shows you is that the mission [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=803.1s)]
*  of these universities, which is to actually [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=805.86s)]
*  celebrate free speech and to teach kids [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=809.22s)]
*  to think critically has been lost. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=812.38s)]
*  And I think that this was a very simple way of seeing it, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=814.34s)]
*  and it should be disturbing to people that this happened, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=819.34s)]
*  that the places where you send our 18 and 19 [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=823.38s)]
*  and 20 year old kids cannot, at a very simple level, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=827.0600000000001s)]
*  teach the moral clarity to say teaching or supporting, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=831.5400000000001s)]
*  even the concept of genocide is wrong. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=835.22s)]
*  Can you teach it in a historical context? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=839.6600000000001s)]
*  Obviously, but that's not what they even said there. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=841.7s)]
*  So they got into a level of verbal gymnastics, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=844.4200000000001s)]
*  which I think is really, it should be viewed by everybody [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=847.34s)]
*  as pretty morally unacceptable. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=849.94s)]
*  I think it's well said, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=851.42s)]
*  and it's clearly bullying or harassment. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=852.34s)]
*  If you're gonna chase Jewish students around campus, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=855.34s)]
*  and I think that's what we saw. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=858.5s)]
*  Now, if you were to Chamath or Sachs, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=860.26s)]
*  or maybe Sachs best, since you're super, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=863.58s)]
*  have a super high benchmark for freedom of speech. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=866.14s)]
*  If these were students in a debate club [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=869.1s)]
*  or in a lecture hall, giving their position, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=871.34s)]
*  taking hard questions, people opting into it, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=874.58s)]
*  wouldn't feel like bullying or harassment. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=877.34s)]
*  Yet the hypocrisy is so thick that they, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=879.86s)]
*  they chase people like Ben Shapiro off campus, et cetera, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=883.38s)]
*  when they had something controversial to say [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=887.1800000000001s)]
*  at many of these schools. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=889.54s)]
*  But I think we can all agree, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=892.02s)]
*  chanting about genocide and chasing students around campus [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=893.78s)]
*  and disrupting the campus, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=896.7s)]
*  that feels like bullying or harassment. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=898.3000000000001s)]
*  I don't know that, and I agree with you Chamath, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=900.0600000000001s)]
*  this mental gymnastics that they went through [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=901.7s)]
*  with these statements, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=904.1800000000001s)]
*  it's just very easy to say, yes, that's harassment. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=905.02s)]
*  Yes, that's bullying. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=907.02s)]
*  Now, if you did it in a lecture hall, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=908.26s)]
*  or you wrote a paper, Sachs, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=911.02s)]
*  maybe doesn't feel like bullying or harassment, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=913.26s)]
*  feels like freedom of speech, yeah? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=915.02s)]
*  Yeah, look, I mean, we can, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=917.66s)]
*  you can always debate the hard cases in free speech [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=919.26s)]
*  and where the line should be. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=923.98s)]
*  And again, I would draw the lines in a way [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=925.5s)]
*  that makes most speech permissible. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=927.98s)]
*  But when you're talking about chasing students around campus [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=930.9s)]
*  to yell in their face, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=934.1s)]
*  that clearly is bullying or harassment, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=935.14s)]
*  and there's no reason to ever allow something like that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=937.26s)]
*  But again, the point I would make is that [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=940.46s)]
*  what you're gonna see in the wake of this [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=942.22s)]
*  is that a lot of Jewish people are realizing [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=943.8199999999999s)]
*  that they don't have a home on the left anymore. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=949.7s)]
*  And I expect that many Jews are gonna start shifting right [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=952.02s)]
*  and into the Republican Party [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=955.74s)]
*  to a place where I've been for a while. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=957.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think this goes back a long way. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=960.22s)]
*  So if you go all the way back [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=962.74s)]
*  to the original civil rights movement in the 1960s, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=963.66s)]
*  I think that many Jews were an integral part [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=966.26s)]
*  of that movement and they felt a great solidarity [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=969.34s)]
*  with the original civil rights movement, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=972.14s)]
*  civil rights leaders, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=974.26s)]
*  because they felt like they had a shared history [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=975.46s)]
*  of persecution, that blacks in America [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=978.8199999999999s)]
*  had suffered from racism, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=981.34s)]
*  Jews around the world felt like [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=982.8199999999999s)]
*  they had suffered from antisemitism. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=984.1s)]
*  And they basically believed that all people [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=985.98s)]
*  should be treated equally, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=988.02s)]
*  that we should have individual rights. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=989.5s)]
*  And basically, they were advocating [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=990.78s)]
*  for a colorblind standard, right? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=993.06s)]
*  Colorblind treatment of all people. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=995.3399999999999s)]
*  And so I think that Jews historically have wanted to be [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=997.42s)]
*  on the left for that reason. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1001.14s)]
*  But I think what's happened over the last few decades [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1002.4599999999999s)]
*  is that the civil rights movement in particular [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1005.3s)]
*  and the left have moved to this woke ideology [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1008.42s)]
*  where it's no longer about colorblindness, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1011.5s)]
*  it's more about identity groups. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1014.26s)]
*  And instead of trying to get past racial differences, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1016.54s)]
*  it's been about accentuating them. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1021.6999999999999s)]
*  And so we've had this whole equity agenda, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1023.74s)]
*  which is really defined as redistribution [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1025.58s)]
*  from one racial group to another racial group. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1028.9s)]
*  I think that for whatever reason, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1031.82s)]
*  a lot of Jews just hadn't confronted the reality [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1033.6200000000001s)]
*  that the left had really changed in this way. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1036.34s)]
*  And again, I think it goes back to the fact [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1039.66s)]
*  that they thought that, oh, well, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1041.46s)]
*  if we're gonna be defining identity groups [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1042.7s)]
*  in this woke way, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1045.6200000000001s)]
*  Jews obviously should be one of these victim groups, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1047.9s)]
*  but they're waking up to the fact that Jews are not. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1050.62s)]
*  Jews are just in the minds of kind of woke ideology, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1053.86s)]
*  Jews are just white people. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1057.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1059.1399999999999s)]
*  Successful white people with too much power. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1059.9799999999998s)]
*  Successful white people with a Jewish background. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1061.82s)]
*  And as a result, they're part of an oppressor class. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1064.06s)]
*  And I think that for a lot of Jewish people [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1067.5s)]
*  who are waking up to this, they're realizing, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1070.7399999999998s)]
*  wait a second, this is actually a very destructive ideology [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1072.26s)]
*  and it makes us the bad guys. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1076.26s)]
*  And so I would expect that, again, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1078.94s)]
*  a lot of Jewish people are waking up [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1081.74s)]
*  to the ways in which the left has changed [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1084.0600000000002s)]
*  and they're realizing that that is not a hospitable place [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1087.66s)]
*  in the political spectrum for them to be. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1090.8200000000002s)]
*  And I would expect there to be kind of a pilgrimage now [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1093.0600000000002s)]
*  of more Jews in America towards the right, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1098.46s)]
*  as opposed to remaining on the left [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1101.1000000000001s)]
*  where they've always been. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1102.5s)]
*  Yeah, the left needs to remember people should be judged, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1103.98s)]
*  not by the color of their skin or their ethnicity, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1108.1s)]
*  but the content of their character. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1110.02s)]
*  It's like quoting MLK, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1114.4599999999998s)]
*  can get you canceled right now, I think, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1116.02s)]
*  to actually say that people should be judged [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1118.1s)]
*  by their character. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1120.06s)]
*  Colorblindness is considered, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1120.8999999999999s)]
*  you know, a lot of people call that racism now. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1123.34s)]
*  That's like, by the way, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1124.86s)]
*  that is the mainstream conservative view [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1126.4599999999998s)]
*  on civil rights related issues, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1129.34s)]
*  is that colorblindness should be the standard, right? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1131.5s)]
*  Wanna treat everyone the same as individuals. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1133.26s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1136.34s)]
*  It was the liberal point of view. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1137.46s)]
*  This was the civil rights movement's basic tenet. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1138.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1141.9s)]
*  We've lost it all. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1142.74s)]
*  By the way, I think there is just one other caveat [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1144.22s)]
*  we have to say about this whole issue, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1146.3s)]
*  which is that it should be possible to criticize [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1147.5800000000002s)]
*  the state of Israel or Netanyahu's government [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1152.22s)]
*  or the bombing campaign they're conducting in Gaza [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1154.78s)]
*  or the actions that led up to this event. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1157.98s)]
*  There should be room to criticize Israel [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1160.42s)]
*  without being called an anti-Semite. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1163.26s)]
*  I wanna be like really clear about that. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1164.74s)]
*  And there needs to be a pretty wide latitude [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1167.78s)]
*  to have that conversation. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1170.7s)]
*  And I do think that one of the mistakes [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1172.46s)]
*  that's happened for a while now [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1175.38s)]
*  is that Jewish groups have been a little too quick [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1178.42s)]
*  on the trigger to call people anti-Semites [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1181.74s)]
*  for criticizing the policies of the Israeli government. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1184.5800000000002s)]
*  And again, I think there needs to be wide latitude [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1188.9s)]
*  to do that. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1191.14s)]
*  However, I don't think that's the type of speech [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1192.3400000000001s)]
*  that we're talking about here, Jason. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1194.98s)]
*  I think you framed it up pretty well. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1195.82s)]
*  This is people who have veered off of legitimate criticism, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1197.6599999999999s)]
*  whether you agree with it or not, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1203.74s)]
*  the legitimate criticism about the Israeli government's [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1204.9399999999998s)]
*  action into this sort of genocidal rhetoric. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1207.62s)]
*  And that's what we're talking about here. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1211.3s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1213.6999999999998s)]
*  Any final thoughts from the rest of the panelists [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1214.62s)]
*  before we move on to business? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1216.1399999999999s)]
*  Do you guys think that they're gonna get fired [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1218.1799999999998s)]
*  or what do you think is the right consequence for this? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1219.74s)]
*  I think they're getting fired. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1221.78s)]
*  I think the money, as you pointed out in your tweet storm, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1223.7s)]
*  is gonna cause that. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1226.78s)]
*  They're gonna lose a lot of donations. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1228.02s)]
*  What do you think, Fieber? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1229.54s)]
*  I'm not tied into these donor groups. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1230.5800000000002s)]
*  It's the donor groups that are gonna drive the decision [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1232.8600000000001s)]
*  because they're gonna call the boards. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1234.82s)]
*  So I think it's really board dependent. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1236.98s)]
*  Obviously, Ackman is a big donor at Harvard [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1238.98s)]
*  and he's been very vocal about [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1241.14s)]
*  what he wants to see Harvard's board do. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1243.3400000000001s)]
*  I think this is gonna drive a big change, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1247.66s)]
*  whether individuals get fired. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1251.46s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1253.74s)]
*  I think of the four, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1254.8600000000001s)]
*  if I were to just have to make a bet, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1256.46s)]
*  I'd say probably at least one of them's getting fired. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1257.78s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1260.06s)]
*  But it's certainly gonna change a lot. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1261.7s)]
*  Jamath, do you think they're gonna get fired? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1262.9s)]
*  What do you think, as you wrap, final word, Jamath? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1264.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think Fieber was right. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1266.1000000000001s)]
*  You have to follow the money [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1267.7s)]
*  and I think the money's been very clear [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1268.9s)]
*  that this can't stand. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1270.5s)]
*  And I think that that's good [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1272.02s)]
*  because I think the people who've been donating [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1272.9s)]
*  have enough moral clarity on these kinds of topics [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1276.5s)]
*  to say this is unacceptable. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1278.8600000000001s)]
*  So how long will it take to filter [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1280.1s)]
*  through the decision-making? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1282.1s)]
*  I don't know, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1283.06s)]
*  because I also don't know how this machinery works. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1283.8999999999999s)]
*  But I think what people have to decide immediately right now [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1285.82s)]
*  is all the kids that are applying [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1289.78s)]
*  for early access and early decision, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1292.62s)]
*  do you really wanna go to these schools? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1295.06s)]
*  And the parents, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1298.4599999999998s)]
*  do you want your kids to be going to these schools? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1300.1399999999999s)]
*  So I think that's a kind of a decision [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1302.6999999999998s)]
*  that can probably happen right now [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1304.8999999999999s)]
*  or needs to happen right now. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1306.54s)]
*  While all of this other kind of like donation-driven, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1308.98s)]
*  asset manager-driven decision-making takes shape. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1312.5s)]
*  All right, let's get into the state of the economy. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1315.6200000000001s)]
*  There's a really interesting story I sent to the group chat [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1318.98s)]
*  from the Financial Times about tribalism now [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1321.18s)]
*  impacting how people view the economy. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1324.94s)]
*  It's called expressive responding. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1327.82s)]
*  Basically, how you feel about the economy [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1329.74s)]
*  is based on which tribe you're in. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1332.06s)]
*  Here's a quick snapshot of what's going on. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1335.02s)]
*  If you're a Republican [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1337.2199999999998s)]
*  and you were doing really well under Biden, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1338.5s)]
*  you're gonna say things are terrible in the economy. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1342.26s)]
*  During Trump, Dems were doing awesome like everybody else, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1344.1s)]
*  but because they hated Trump, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1346.78s)]
*  they said the economy was trash. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1347.86s)]
*  Here's the chart that explains that. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1349.9399999999998s)]
*  And then I'll give you a couple of quick bullet points [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1353.1s)]
*  of where the economy is, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1354.6599999999999s)]
*  but you see the divergent there in the charts [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1355.58s)]
*  and based on the different administrations being in power. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1358.4199999999998s)]
*  And if you look at the second chart, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1362.86s)]
*  it's pretty telling this isn't happening, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1364.3s)]
*  this tribalism is not happening in other countries. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1366.54s)]
*  You can see France, Germany, UK, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1368.78s)]
*  people feel about the economy, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1370.98s)]
*  how the economy is actually doing pretty wild data. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1373.3s)]
*  And I'll let you respond to that in just a second. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1377.66s)]
*  I'm just gonna give you eight quick hits [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1379.5s)]
*  on what's going on in the economy. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1381.5s)]
*  Credit card debt is reaching all time highs. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1382.94s)]
*  We surpassed one trillion back in July, keeps rising. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1385.26s)]
*  People are taking money out of their 401ks. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1388.82s)]
*  Hardship distributions increased 13% between Q2 and Q3. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1391.22s)]
*  Super spending just collapsed in October, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1394.58s)]
*  growing only 0.2% last month versus 7% in September. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1396.46s)]
*  But November year over year increases in Black Friday [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1401.1399999999999s)]
*  and Cyber Monday spending. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1404.1s)]
*  So maybe that's a head fake, I don't know. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1406.1s)]
*  Maybe people are bargain hunting. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1407.54s)]
*  Consumer prices rose just 3.2% year over year in October [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1409.5s)]
*  versus 9.1% in June of 2022. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1413.5s)]
*  Home sale, 13 year low in October. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1417.26s)]
*  Most folks are betting interest rate increases are over [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1420.34s)]
*  and some are betting interest rate cuts [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1423.46s)]
*  will start as early as Q1. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1425.8200000000002s)]
*  Kalshi's forecast say we should expect to see [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1427.0600000000002s)]
*  and that's a prediction market. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1429.8600000000001s)]

*  It's hard to know because there's so many mixed signals. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1445.8200000000002s)]

*  There's a lot of mixed economic data right now, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1452.62s)]
*  but I mean, the economy seems to be doing fairly well, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1454.3799999999999s)]
*  but the electorate doesn't feel it. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1458.02s)]
*  And you're seeing in recent weeks, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1460.1s)]
*  you're seeing a lot of commentary by pundits [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1462.62s)]
*  trying to convince the American people [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1467.02s)]
*  that the economy is better than the people evidently feel [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1469.1s)]
*  that it is. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1472.78s)]
*  And I think that one of the big reasons for this gap [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1474.06s)]
*  is that over the last few years, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1479.8999999999999s)]
*  we've had a lot of inflation [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1482.06s)]
*  and the rise in price levels has not been matched [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1484.6599999999999s)]
*  by the rise in people's incomes. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1488.62s)]
*  So people simply feel worse off [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1490.62s)]
*  because their spending powers diminish. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1492.78s)]
*  Now it's true that the current inflation rate is going down [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1495.06s)]
*  but all that means is that the price level now [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1500.1s)]
*  is growing at call it 3% ish a year. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1502.7s)]
*  It's still growing. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1505.98s)]
*  It's not like prices have come down. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1506.94s)]
*  They're just rising at a slower rate. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1508.8999999999999s)]
*  Last year we had a 9% in inflation [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1512.46s)]
*  and inflation has been high the last couple of years. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1515.6200000000001s)]
*  The rate of increase is slowing down, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1518.66s)]
*  but people's wages, if you're working class, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1520.74s)]
*  have simply not kept up with the price of goods and services. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1524.0600000000002s)]
*  And so I think people feel worse off [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1528.66s)]
*  than they did a few years ago. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1531.5800000000002s)]
*  And you can try to convince them [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1533.78s)]
*  till you're blue in the face [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1535.7s)]
*  that actually the economic data is great, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1537.74s)]
*  but if you're somebody whose wages have not kept pace [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1539.7s)]
*  with price levels, you're not gonna feel better off. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1543.38s)]
*  Chamath, on your first point, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1546.3s)]
*  I think that there is this thing [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1548.5800000000002s)]
*  that we've grown accustomed to, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1551.9s)]
*  which is how you feel about what's happening [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1553.94s)]
*  versus what the data may say. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1558.82s)]
*  And I think that the press and journalists [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1561.02s)]
*  in a pretty untrustworthy way [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1565.6200000000001s)]
*  amplify this separation. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1568.38s)]
*  So we hear about the economy doing well, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1570.8200000000002s)]
*  maybe it's not doing well. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1574.5800000000002s)]
*  We hear how the economy is not doing well [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1575.6200000000001s)]
*  and it actually is doing well. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1577.9s)]
*  Nobody wants to write about the data, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1579.8200000000002s)]
*  people wanna write about their feelings. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1581.6200000000001s)]
*  And their feelings largely are more defined [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1584.0600000000002s)]
*  by the people around them and what they feel. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1586.3000000000002s)]
*  So simple example, Nick, if you just wanna throw this up, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1588.5400000000002s)]
*  but this is the Federal Reserve's data, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1591.1000000000001s)]
*  this is not anybody else's data, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1593.1000000000001s)]
*  but you would think that the wealth gap [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1594.42s)]
*  is being exacerbated and you would think [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1596.6599999999999s)]
*  that wealth gains are going to a few. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1600.3799999999999s)]
*  And again, without having an opinion, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1602.78s)]
*  the data shows something truly incredible, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1604.82s)]
*  which is that the American dream [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1607.1799999999998s)]
*  is not hanging on by a lifeline, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1608.46s)]
*  but more and more American families are achieving it. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1611.78s)]
*  12% of American families [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1616.6599999999999s)]
*  are now considered millionaire households, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1618.26s)]
*  8% are considered multimillionaire households. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1620.02s)]
*  That's incredible, but what's even more impressive [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1623.06s)]
*  is that even as they do well, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1625.78s)]
*  the cohort underneath them, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1628.66s)]
*  the folks that make 150 to 250K a year [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1630.06s)]
*  are the ones that are absolutely crushing [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1634.46s)]
*  and they're making more than the top 10% of all families. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1636.38s)]
*  So I think Jason, the broader economic takeaway I have [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1640.38s)]
*  is unless you're willing to look at the raw data, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1645.22s)]
*  the risk is high that you will be fed [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1649.26s)]
*  an emotional perspective that amplifies your bias [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1654.46s)]
*  or causes you to reject that view [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1658.5s)]
*  because it just seems so untrustworthy [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1660.46s)]
*  and it doesn't map to what you're seeing. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1662.02s)]
*  It's very, very hard to tell the truth. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1663.7s)]
*  That is federal reserve data [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1665.7s)]
*  that tells the truth about the US economy. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1667.3s)]
*  And it turns out that the economy is pretty good [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1669.46s)]
*  and doing a lot for a lot of people. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1671.82s)]
*  Freberg, where do you sit? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1676.14s)]
*  You've brought up the issue of credit card debt [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1676.98s)]
*  as a leading indicator. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1680.06s)]
*  It continues to surge, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1681.26s)]
*  but there is some inkling that consumers may be tapped out, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1683.66s)]
*  i.e. tapping their 401Ks. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1686.94s)]
*  So what's your take on the consumer and this tribalism [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1689.8600000000001s)]
*  that we're seeing in the interpretation of data [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1693.9s)]
*  and how people feel about the economy? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1696.26s)]
*  No, I mean, I think if people don't feel [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1697.94s)]
*  like they're progressing on the order of 10% a year [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1700.1000000000001s)]
*  in terms of income adjusted for purchasing power, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1704.94s)]
*  they're generally gonna be unhappy [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1710.46s)]
*  and they're gonna project that as a general statement [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1711.74s)]
*  about quote, the economy. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1713.9s)]
*  And so the more people that that's the case, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1716.3s)]
*  the more you see that happening. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1718.38s)]
*  And so while there may be a minority of people [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1720.1s)]
*  that are seeing great economic mobility, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1723.66s)]
*  if a large enough percentage of people, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1727.34s)]
*  I don't see it roughly call it 10% increase [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1729.06s)]
*  in lifestyle ability year to year, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1731.98s)]
*  that's gonna catch up to these overall scores [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1736.38s)]
*  of consumer sentiment. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1739.5s)]
*  I think the way that economists measure the economy [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1740.7s)]
*  is a lot different than the average person [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1742.5800000000002s)]
*  measures the economy, which is really their own, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1744.02s)]
*  purchasing power and income. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1746.78s)]
*  Sachs, you're up. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1748.14s)]
*  Look, at the end of the day, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1749.1000000000001s)]
*  the question that people ask themselves, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1750.0600000000002s)]
*  which is the question that Ronald Reagan asked voters [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1753.38s)]
*  in 1980 is, are you better off than you were four years ago? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1755.42s)]
*  And I think that a lot of people, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1758.7s)]
*  particularly working class people don't feel better off [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1760.14s)]
*  because mainly their wages have not kept pace [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1763.22s)]
*  with the overall inflation level, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1766.14s)]
*  not just measured on a one year basis, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1769.14s)]
*  but over a four year basis. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1771.42s)]
*  And I do think this could explain [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1773.74s)]
*  some of the tribalism, Jason, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1775.14s)]
*  is that we've talked about this before, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1776.42s)]
*  that the biggest gap in the electorate [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1778.18s)]
*  is between professional class and working class. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1780.5s)]
*  If you're a professional class, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1783.3400000000001s)]
*  meaning you have at least one college degree, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1784.5s)]
*  by more than 30 points, you're likely to be a Democrat. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1787.74s)]
*  And if you're a working class, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1790.74s)]
*  which just means no college degree, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1792.46s)]
*  let's say high school educated, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1794.7s)]
*  you're much more likely to be a Republican. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1796.18s)]
*  The parties have sort of flipped. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1797.9s)]
*  The Republican party is now a working class party. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1799.86s)]
*  I think a lot of people find that very surprising. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1801.94s)]
*  It's not the party of fat cap bankers anymore [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1804.26s)]
*  and the Fortune 500. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1807.42s)]
*  So the parties have really flipped. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1809.74s)]
*  And I do think that working class people [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1811.42s)]
*  are most impacted by inflation. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1814.54s)]
*  If you're kind of in lower to mid income [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1818.06s)]
*  and the wages of labor have not gone up [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1821.5s)]
*  and prices have, then you're gonna be worse off. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1824.3s)]
*  And I think that's a very important part of it. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1827.22s)]
*  And I think the media is sort of working on overdrive [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1828.9s)]
*  right now to convince people that they should think [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1831.26s)]
*  that their circumstances are better than they actually are. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1834.1000000000001s)]
*  And look, maybe the overall economic data right now [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1837.22s)]
*  is mixed to positive. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1842.22s)]
*  I'll certainly concede that. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1844.5s)]
*  But I think for the average person, [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1847.26s)]
*  what they care about is their pocketbook [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1848.46s)]
*  and it's far from clear that they're better off now [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1849.7s)]
*  than they were four years ago. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1851.8600000000001s)]
*  Jason, what do you think? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1853.42s)]
*  I think that's an important segment [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1854.3s)]
*  because you're correct, Sax, in a very nuanced point, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1855.22s)]
*  multiple things true at once here. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1858.98s)]
*  There is still sticker shock from inflation. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1860.46s)]
*  I went to buy a birthday cake, it was $47 for a cake. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1863.06s)]
*  I was shocked. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1866.3s)]
*  How does a birthday cake cost $47? [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1867.14s)]
*  Is it made of cocaine? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1868.98s)]
*  No, no, I just put the cocaine all over the top. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1871.02s)]
*  Yeah, I just, you know. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1873.42s)]
*  I think I got truffle shaved on it. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1874.26s)]
*  I really felt like it was a white truffle cake [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1875.9s)]
*  and this was a small cake. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1877.86s)]
*  It was nuts. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1879.06s)]
*  Anyway, there is sticker shock. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1880.18s)]
*  The truth is though, wages are very strong right now [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1881.78s)]
*  and wages are slightly outpacing inflation, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1885.42s)]
*  but that is a new phenomenon, correct, Sax. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1888.06s)]
*  That is a new phenomenon. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1890.42s)]
*  So people are still feeling the sticker shock, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1891.62s)]
*  but at the same time, unemployment and wages drive [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1894.18s)]
*  how people feel and people are feeling [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1898.02s)]
*  obviously very confident as you see in the credit card debt. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1900.3799999999999s)]
*  When you're confident, to Trimot's point [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1902.82s)]
*  about just follow the money and look at the actual numbers, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1905.3s)]
*  people would not be taking out credit card debt. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1907.74s)]
*  They wouldn't tap the 401k [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1909.42s)]
*  if they felt they've got great job prospects. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1910.74s)]
*  They have options for jobs. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1913.5s)]
*  It's a 50 year low in unemployment, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1914.82s)]
*  which is unbelievable that that's continued [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1917.14s)]
*  and wages are increasing. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1919.74s)]
*  Uber drivers are now making 34, $36. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1921.26s)]
*  And listen, I've been tracking how much they think [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1924.86s)]
*  from the beginning, it was $15, then $20, then $25. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1926.5s)]
*  So wages are increasing massively. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1930.46s)]
*  The GDP is 5% or something like that [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1933.1s)]
*  and unemployment is low. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1935.1s)]
*  So the economy is actually doing a shredder. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1936.26s)]
*  That's just the fact. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1939.22s)]
*  But the sticker shock is very, very real. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1940.26s)]
*  So I think we can wrap it there [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1943.14s)]
*  unless anybody wants to add anything to this. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1945.06s)]
*  Well, by the way, just over the last month, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1946.1s)]
*  there's been a huge rally in stocks, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1949.06s)]
*  especially growth stocks. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1951.1s)]
*  Bitcoin has now rallied to 44,000. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1952.1s)]
*  What? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1954.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1955.42s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1956.26s)]
*  A firm is up like 20% today. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1957.08s)]
*  That's the buy now pay later company. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1959.58s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1961.86s)]
*  On strong Christmas spending, like you're saying. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1962.7s)]
*  All the stocks, sacks that bottomed [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1964.94s)]
*  because of interest rates have now just started [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1967.78s)]
*  to massively rally massively. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1970.18s)]
*  So all the secular. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1972.42s)]
*  This is all based on expectations of rate cuts [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1973.7s)]
*  coming sooner than people thought. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1976.46s)]
*  And I think Bill Ackman has really led this trade [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1978.46s)]
*  and he timed it perfectly apparently [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1981.46s)]
*  by basically going long in the bond market [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1983.5s)]
*  like a month ago. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1987.7s)]
*  10 years at 417, 411, sorry. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1988.94s)]
*  I mean, we're off like 80 basis points [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1991.3799999999999s)]
*  in like a couple months. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1994.54s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1995.82s)]
*  All this euphoria, we've gone from fear to greed [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=1996.94s)]
*  and really in one or two months, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2000.18s)]
*  it's all driven by rate expectations [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2002.5800000000002s)]
*  that people are expecting a rate cut in Q1. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2004.74s)]
*  And so far, that's not really justified [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2007.98s)]
*  by the feds hawkish rhetoric, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2010.7s)]
*  but people nevertheless seem to think it's coming. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2013.14s)]
*  I think that this could be, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2015.6200000000001s)]
*  do you want to put on my tin foil? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2017.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, put it on. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2019.38s)]
*  Conspiracy corner with David Sacks. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2021.22s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2024.8600000000001s)]
*  I think there will be a rate cut in Q1 [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2026.82s)]
*  and I think this is the Biden bailout. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2029.74s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2031.8999999999999s)]
*  I think this is a Biden bailout by the fed [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2032.74s)]
*  because if they cut rates in Q1, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2036.1799999999998s)]
*  that's gonna make everyone feel really flush. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2038.54s)]
*  It takes about six months to work its way into the system, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2040.3799999999999s)]
*  but that's gonna give a big boost to the Biden campaign. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2042.9799999999998s)]
*  If you see a quarter point rate cut in Q1, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2045.86s)]
*  a trillion of the 5.7 trillion in money market accounts [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2049.1s)]
*  will rip into the market. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2052.8599999999997s)]
*  Oh, wow. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2054.5s)]
*  That'll be nuts. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2055.3399999999997s)]
*  Just people knowing that they're on the way down, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2056.58s)]
*  that they've peaked in on the way down [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2058.8999999999996s)]
*  is gonna unlock a lot of capital. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2060.4599999999996s)]
*  It's gonna unlock a lot of capital. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2061.98s)]
*  And to be clear, it's a small group of people [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2063.7s)]
*  who believe it's coming in the first quarter, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2065.8599999999997s)]
*  Bill Ackman and David Sacks. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2067.4199999999996s)]
*  The majority, according to prediction markets think, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2069.2599999999998s)]
*  we'll have two of them by the summer. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2071.74s)]
*  Without debating whether it happens in first quarter [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2074.3799999999997s)]
*  or second quarter, the more fundamental thing is, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2076.8599999999997s)]
*  if you look two years out, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2079.3399999999997s)]
*  if you look two years out, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2080.62s)]
*  you probably see rates around 2.5%. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2081.8599999999997s)]
*  And that's 160 basis points from here. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2086.9s)]
*  That's the big, big change that I think helps all of us, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2090.42s)]
*  quite honestly. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2093.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2095.02s)]
*  And let's segue here. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2095.8599999999997s)]
*  Great segment, by the way, gentlemen. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2097.7s)]
*  Because in our backyard, what we do every day [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2100.2599999999998s)]
*  in terms of capital allocation and building companies, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2102.8199999999997s)]
*  the cleanup work continues. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2106.18s)]
*  It was a rager, folks. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2107.74s)]
*  People partied well into the next day, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2108.86s)]
*  and we're still seeing the cleanup. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2112.1400000000003s)]
*  CARTA has some great data. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2113.9s)]
*  And this is data amongst CARTA users, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2116.06s)]
*  which is a subset of users willing to pay an expensive price [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2117.86s)]
*  to manage their cap tables. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2122.42s)]
*  The number of companies that shut down [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2123.7400000000002s)]
*  after raising 10 million, which is a very high benchmark, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2126.26s)]
*  that's up 238% in 2023, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2128.82s)]
*  from 47 companies last year to 112 this year. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2132.6600000000003s)]
*  Also VC firms, and I'm seeing this very quietly happening. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2136.94s)]
*  This isn't reported on VC firms are very opaque [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2140.7000000000003s)]
*  about laying people off or reshuffling the deck, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2143.58s)]
*  but a firm called OpenView out of Boston [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2145.82s)]
*  just abruptly shut down. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2149.26s)]
*  They had 70 plus employees. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2150.46s)]
*  They just raised about 600 million [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2151.9s)]
*  of an $800 million target for their fund. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2154.3s)]
*  There were reports about Graycoff not hitting their target [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2157.9s)]
*  and reshuffling a bit. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2160.54s)]
*  That might've been overstated, to be honest. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2161.42s)]
*  But on the bright side, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2164.18s)]
*  we're seeing some rebounding in ARR [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2165.82s)]
*  of the public SaaS companies that started to rebound in Q3. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2167.98s)]
*  Here's the chart from Altimeter. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2171.1400000000003s)]
*  Looks like we hit bottom in Q1 of 2023. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2173.98s)]
*  Another bright spot, public firms [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2177.42s)]
*  that are continuing to downsize [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2179.38s)]
*  are getting rewarded by the public market. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2181.02s)]
*  Spotify just did a third layoff, 17%. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2183.06s)]
*  It's around 1,500 employees. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2186.5800000000004s)]
*  So I guess, Sachs, everybody was thinking SaaS was over. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2188.5800000000004s)]
*  It was the end of days. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2192.5800000000004s)]
*  We talked about not a recession in SaaS, but a depression, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2193.94s)]
*  and I think that was accurate. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2198.2200000000003s)]
*  How are you feeling about the private company market [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2200.1s)]
*  and maybe stabilization [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2203.1s)]
*  or the return of growth in SaaS companies? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2204.34s)]
*  Well, what I've been saying for the past year, year and a half, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2207.82s)]
*  is that we've been in a software recession. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2211.46s)]
*  The overall economy may not have been in a recession [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2213.38s)]
*  because the consumer has stayed strong, as you said. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2216.98s)]
*  Consumer spending has stayed strong. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2219.9s)]
*  So the B to C part has held up the economy, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2221.18s)]
*  but I think in B to B, and particularly in software, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2224.9s)]
*  there has absolutely been a recession. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2227.46s)]
*  It started in the first half of 2022 with rate hikes. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2229.58s)]
*  There was a huge revaluation of growth stocks, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2233.86s)]
*  and you saw multiples come down on SaaS valuations [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2238.3s)]
*  from in the public markets as high as 35 down to seven or eight, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2242.94s)]
*  something like that. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2247.5s)]
*  In private VC world, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2248.82s)]
*  we saw valuations go from, call it 100 times ARR [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2251.02s)]
*  to something more like 30 times ARR. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2255.14s)]
*  So the first half of 2022, we saw a valuation correction, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2256.66s)]
*  but then around mid 2022, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2260.62s)]
*  what I started seeing in all my board meetings [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2262.82s)]
*  was every startup started missing its sales forecast, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2264.42s)]
*  and they started re-forecasting down, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2267.94s)]
*  and that process really continued for a year, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2270.5s)]
*  and we saw the exact same thing in the public markets [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2272.5s)]
*  and public SaaS companies as well, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2275.7s)]
*  and it's really remarkable how the data [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2277.82s)]
*  from the public stocks that our friend Jammin Ball [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2281.1400000000003s)]
*  from Altimeter has been publishing regularly, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2284.82s)]
*  how that has matched up with what I've seen [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2289.7400000000002s)]
*  kind of anecdotally in board meetings [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2292.6200000000003s)]
*  and in conversations in the VC space. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2295.26s)]
*  That's super healthy correct sacks [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2297.38s)]
*  that the CEOs and the boards understand, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2299.0600000000004s)]
*  hey, these private market valuations have to in some way [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2302.7400000000002s)]
*  be informed by public. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2306.1800000000003s)]
*  Sure, because the public stocks are the exit comps. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2307.8599999999997s)]
*  So if the public stocks are worth, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2311.02s)]
*  I don't know, a third of what they used to be, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2314.54s)]
*  then private valuations have to reflect that. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2316.3399999999997s)]
*  But in any event, I wanna go beyond [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2319.02s)]
*  just talking about valuations here, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2320.4199999999996s)]
*  I wanna talk about the business results. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2321.54s)]
*  And again, for this time period from call it mid 2022 [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2323.98s)]
*  to mid 2023, there was a software recession. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2329.14s)]
*  Software companies were cutting jobs, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2333.66s)]
*  they were re-forecasting down, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2335.5s)]
*  they were growing slower. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2337.9s)]
*  In many cases, they were actually shrinking. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2338.74s)]
*  I mean, some companies lost ARR because of churn. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2340.46s)]
*  A lot of their customers were shutting down [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2346.06s)]
*  or sharpening their pencils, they were consolidating vendors. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2348.38s)]
*  The last year has been a really, really tough time [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2351.18s)]
*  in the software space. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2354.18s)]
*  But I think now we've turned a corner. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2355.54s)]
*  I started seeing in the last couple of months, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2357.06s)]
*  I started seeing green shoots in some of my board meetings. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2360.22s)]
*  And now here we have this chart from Jammin, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2363.7s)]
*  can you just put this on the screen again? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2365.74s)]
*  Where we saw that finally in Q3, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2367.62s)]
*  we went from four quarters of negative growth [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2370.7799999999997s)]
*  in NetNew ARR to finally a quarter of positive growth. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2374.62s)]
*  Now, 2% is not a great number, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2378.22s)]
*  but at least we are finally positive, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2380.3399999999997s)]
*  as opposed to negative, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2383.2599999999998s)]
*  which means that NetNew ARR was shrinking. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2384.3399999999997s)]
*  I think again, the software recession, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2386.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm calling an end to the software recession. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2388.62s)]
*  And- [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2391.9399999999996s)]
*  Is it an official breaking news? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2392.78s)]
*  Breaking news. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2393.86s)]
*  Tax is called an end. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2394.7000000000003s)]
*  So let the party begin. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2396.42s)]
*  I think software revenues are gonna rebound. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2398.46s)]
*  I think the open question that's remaining then [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2401.5400000000004s)]
*  is will valuations rebound? [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2404.1400000000003s)]
*  Or will you have to grow into the last valuation [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2406.3s)]
*  or some truncated valuation? [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2409.98s)]
*  And this is where, even if rates go to 2%, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2411.86s)]
*  are people going to be as excited again [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2417.02s)]
*  to bring the public markets back [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2419.5800000000004s)]
*  to 15 and 20 times forward ARR? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2420.98s)]
*  And that's an open question. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2423.22s)]
*  I think the market says no, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2425.66s)]
*  which means that even as growth comes back, [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2427.5s)]
*  you still have a valuation reset. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2430.82s)]
*  That may actually explain why startups are shutting down, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2432.62s)]
*  why venture firms that, you know, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2436.78s)]
*  if you looked at that firm in Boston that shut down, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2439.1s)]
*  they had some seemingly very good companies [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2441.58s)]
*  in their portfolio. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2443.66s)]
*  So there should be nothing stopping them [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2444.5s)]
*  from continuing to raise capital and invest. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2445.82s)]
*  But I just suspect the end market that they operate in [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2449.06s)]
*  is gonna be value constrained [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2452.94s)]
*  if they pay top dollar for things [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2454.2999999999997s)]
*  that are now just worth a lot less, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2456.2599999999998s)]
*  even if they double revenue. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2458.82s)]
*  I'll give you an example. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2461.18s)]
*  We talk to the private equity guys a lot [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2462.06s)]
*  just because we try to understand [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2463.62s)]
*  where they are buyers, right? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2465.34s)]
*  Why is that important, Shemath? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2467.18s)]
*  Explain why private equity versus public markets [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2468.14s)]
*  and how they think about businesses. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2470.66s)]
*  Because I think it's a very important point [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2471.98s)]
*  that you've made to me privately. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2473.2599999999998s)]
*  I think that when you look at the ecosystem, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2474.42s)]
*  the ecosystem doesn't work [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2478.3s)]
*  if you never get liquidity to your employees [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2480.98s)]
*  and to your shareholders. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2484.94s)]
*  So liquidity happens in one of two ways. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2487.26s)]
*  It can go in the public markets [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2491.26s)]
*  or you can transact to private equity. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2492.6600000000003s)]
*  Why? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2494.5800000000004s)]
*  Because they have almost as much money, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2495.42s)]
*  and frankly, more in many cases to pay [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2497.78s)]
*  than a public market can give you via a traditional IPO. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2500.46s)]
*  So I think that they are a pretty rational buyer. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2504.86s)]
*  And they do a very good job [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2507.1s)]
*  because they are a concentrated buyer [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2509.94s)]
*  of finding a very fair price. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2512.86s)]
*  What is the real honest market clearing price? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2514.58s)]
*  And so if you don't wanna look at the market [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2516.8199999999997s)]
*  through rose-colored glasses, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2519.22s)]
*  and you want sobriety, ask a private equity investor [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2520.9s)]
*  what they would buy your position for. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2524.42s)]
*  That's why I spend a lot of time talking to them [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2526.2999999999997s)]
*  because I wanna know what this stuff is really worth. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2528.2599999999998s)]
*  And what I would tell you is that even for companies [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2530.8199999999997s)]
*  that are in the hundreds of millions of ARR, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2533.7s)]
*  the premiums that they're willing to pay [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2537.2999999999997s)]
*  are between three and five times ARR at the high end. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2540.14s)]
*  And that a lot of deals get transacted [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2544.06s)]
*  between one and three times ARR. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2546.06s)]
*  That may not be what people wanna hear, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2548.02s)]
*  but that's because when you look at the underlying ability [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2549.66s)]
*  to generate cashflow, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2552.18s)]
*  many of these businesses haven't proved it yet. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2554.38s)]
*  And so they want to buy things in a margin of safety [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2557.94s)]
*  where they can come in and cut certain expenses [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2560.42s)]
*  while still helping to grow in certain markets. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2563.94s)]
*  All of that used to be a 10x multiple in the public markets. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2568.46s)]
*  So private equity is buying for three to five times [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2572.1s)]
*  and really one to three times. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2574.46s)]
*  It's gonna be hard for the public market buyer [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2578.02s)]
*  to be paying a lot more than that. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2580.1800000000003s)]
*  Got it. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2581.7400000000002s)]
*  Can I build on that? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2582.58s)]
*  This is a chart that was published on December 1st [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2583.4s)]
*  by Jammin at Altimeter. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2585.46s)]
*  And I do think it speaks to the valuation question quite well. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2588.54s)]
*  You can see here that there's this line at 7.8 times, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2593.54s)]
*  which I think refers to 7.8 times next 12 months revenue. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2599.22s)]
*  That is the long-term pre-COVID average. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2604.22s)]
*  So that is where the average SaaS stock has traded [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2606.46s)]
*  over a long period of time. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2610.34s)]
*  We're currently, as of December 1st, we're at 5.8. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2612.62s)]
*  I think it's probably a little higher now [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2615.66s)]
*  because the markets pretty much rallied [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2616.7799999999997s)]
*  over the last five days. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2618.86s)]
*  But you can see that we're still trading [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2620.4s)]
*  below the long-term average in terms of multiples. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2622.96s)]
*  And part of that is because interest, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2628.56s)]
*  the 10-year is still at 4.3%. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2630.1600000000003s)]
*  Although it's come down quite a bit. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2632.92s)]
*  You can see a peak there around 5%. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2634.52s)]
*  Now it's at 4.3. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2636.88s)]
*  If you believe that the 10-year is gonna go back down to, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2638.52s)]
*  I don't know, this two and a half, 3% range, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2643.1600000000003s)]
*  and if you believe that growth is re-accelerating, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2645.6s)]
*  then I think there is room for this number, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2650.0s)]
*  the 5.8 number, to at least grow into the long-term average, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2654.88s)]
*  which is 7.8. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2660.84s)]
*  So there is room there. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2662.82s)]
*  I think that as these stocks are priced today, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2664.36s)]
*  it doesn't feel like they're overpriced. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2668.0s)]
*  Let's put it that way. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2670.88s)]
*  And I never wanna tell anyone what to buy. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2672.4s)]
*  But you can see here that we are still trending [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2674.4s)]
*  below the long-term average. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2676.8s)]
*  He should pull this number back to 2010. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2678.12s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2680.88s)]
*  So at the start of the super cycle, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2681.72s)]
*  after the Great Recession. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2683.72s)]
*  Not a bad point. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2685.3199999999997s)]
*  And probably pull it back, frankly, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2686.16s)]
*  all the way to 2005, 2006, [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2687.48s)]
*  because you had enough companies there that were public [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2689.72s)]
*  that were sassy software companies, including Salesforce. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2692.3199999999997s)]
*  Might be a six instead of 7.8, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2695.3599999999997s)]
*  and we might be at the 20-year average. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2696.7599999999998s)]
*  That's a really good point. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2698.2799999999997s)]
*  I'll ask Brad to do that. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2699.12s)]
*  Freeberg, switching to you, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2699.96s)]
*  you have been a capital allocator and company formation [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2702.2799999999997s)]
*  executive for the last, getting close to a decade. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2706.76s)]
*  And you made big news this week. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2710.7200000000003s)]
*  Instead of doing more funds, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2712.4s)]
*  which I know you had a lot of people interested [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2714.8s)]
*  in backing your funds, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2716.44s)]
*  you decided you're going all in [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2718.0s)]
*  and that you are choosing to take the highest performer, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2720.1600000000003s)]
*  most promising company in your portfolio [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2723.76s)]
*  and become CEO of that company. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2725.4s)]
*  Explain your decision, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2727.44s)]
*  because I think it does relate [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2728.7200000000003s)]
*  exactly because you're got skin in the game here, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2730.5200000000004s)]
*  the most skin possible, which is your time. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2732.92s)]
*  You've decided to go the CEO route, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2735.32s)]
*  put all your eggs in one basket. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2736.6400000000003s)]
*  Explain your thinking. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2737.76s)]
*  We started a business at the production board, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2738.6000000000004s)]
*  which is my firm, four years ago, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2741.1600000000003s)]
*  with Jud Ward, who's the CTO and co-founder of this business [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2744.88s)]
*  who came up with some pretty novel ideas [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2748.84s)]
*  on how we could use gene editing [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2752.04s)]
*  to make incredible transformations [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2754.36s)]
*  in agriculture a reality. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2756.52s)]
*  The conversation originally started [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2758.1600000000003s)]
*  from a paper I read in January of 2019. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2759.84s)]
*  I reached out to Jud and said, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2762.88s)]
*  hey, we should talk about this paper. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2764.24s)]
*  And we started brainstorming [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2765.6s)]
*  and Jud came up with this concept for this business. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2767.6s)]
*  And it was really a, call it a moonshot [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2770.7999999999997s)]
*  that they undertook. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2775.2s)]
*  And we've put tens of millions of dollars of capital [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2776.48s)]
*  into this project over the last four years [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2779.48s)]
*  and been operating it in stealth. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2781.24s)]
*  And the team had some pretty significant breakthroughs [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2783.16s)]
*  this year that make the whole thing a reality now. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2785.64s)]
*  The potential of the business is so significant [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2788.0s)]
*  that I really don't have a choice, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2791.16s)]
*  but to go all in on this. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2794.92s)]
*  It's a no brainer, as I said in the tweet I put out. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2796.0s)]
*  I could spend a bunch of my time, as you said, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2798.8s)]
*  starting other businesses or making investments, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2801.8s)]
*  but at the end of the day, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2803.88s)]
*  investing accrues to a power law [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2807.48s)]
*  where if you have something that's gonna be transformative, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2811.44s)]
*  it could be many multiples on all the other stuff you do. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2814.92s)]
*  And so it only made sense for me to say, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2819.16s)]
*  look, I've got to dedicate my time, attention, energy [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2820.7599999999998s)]
*  to making sure that this business realizes its potential. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2824.04s)]
*  I'm gonna go in full time as CEO. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2827.0s)]
*  So it's pretty exciting. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2828.9199999999996s)]
*  Gene editing, I'll talk a little bit about it, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2830.7599999999998s)]
*  but I can't share too many details. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2832.3199999999997s)]
*  Gene editing, as you guys know, was discovered, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2834.3599999999997s)]
*  it's controversial whether it was discovered first [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2837.72s)]
*  by George Church and the group at the Broad in Harvard [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2839.7999999999997s)]
*  or Jennifer Doudna and her group at Berkeley. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2843.0s)]
*  But CRISPR-Cas9 is the system [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2846.64s)]
*  that allowed us for the first time ever [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2850.28s)]
*  to go in and make specific edits to DNA. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2852.28s)]
*  Historically, any work we've done in the genome [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2856.0400000000004s)]
*  has been very ad hoc, haphazard, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2860.1600000000003s)]
*  throwing large amounts of DNA into a cell [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2863.28s)]
*  to try and get that cell to do something. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2865.6400000000003s)]
*  But CRISPR really unlocked this, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2867.8s)]
*  call it search and replace function in DNA. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2869.52s)]
*  And that capability has allowed researchers [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2873.52s)]
*  to make novel therapeutics, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2876.6800000000003s)]
*  to have new discoveries in biology, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2878.16s)]
*  and it's really unlocked an entirely new era in biology. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2880.92s)]
*  One application of gene editing is in agriculture, [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2885.2s)]
*  where we can look specifically at the genes in plants [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2887.6s)]
*  and what they do to the plant. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2890.8799999999997s)]
*  And if we can make specific changes [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2893.0s)]
*  that you would otherwise see in nature [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2895.3999999999996s)]
*  through traditional plant breeding [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2897.8799999999997s)]
*  and mutations happen over time through plant breeding, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2899.44s)]
*  can you accelerate those changes? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2902.64s)]
*  And can you make a set of changes [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2904.12s)]
*  rather than spend millennia breeding plants, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2906.08s)]
*  can you make a specific set of changes [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2907.92s)]
*  that will cause the plant to do something very novel [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2910.12s)]
*  and as a result, get the plant to be more successful? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2913.0s)]
*  And by editing the DNA of the plant [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2916.2400000000002s)]
*  to make it more successful, its yield goes up, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2917.8s)]
*  it can generate more food with less water, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2920.36s)]
*  more food with less land, [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2922.28s)]
*  more food with less labor, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2923.84s)]
*  That's the general premise on how we can use gene editing [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2927.08s)]
*  to drive productivity in agriculture. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2930.16s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2932.52s)]
*  And you could, I assume, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2933.44s)]
*  make the strawberries taste more delicious [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2935.0s)]
*  like those ones from Hokkaido in Japan [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2937.28s)]
*  as opposed to just making them giant flavorless softballs. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2939.7200000000003s)]
*  The way gene editing has been thought about in agriculture [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2943.4s)]
*  over the last decade has been exactly what you're saying, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2946.28s)]
*  which is to make a specific trait edit, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2949.4s)]
*  which is one edit in one gene [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2951.5600000000004s)]
*  that does one specific thing to the plant. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2953.6000000000004s)]
*  And what Judd and the team came up with [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2956.44s)]
*  was starting with the problem [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2958.1200000000003s)]
*  rather than starting with this, you know, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2959.6000000000004s)]
*  kind of very specific thing that we could do. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2961.52s)]
*  And they said, how do we get yield [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2963.76s)]
*  to go up significantly in plants? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2965.6s)]
*  And they came up with this creative idea, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2968.0s)]
*  which is doing a series of edits, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2970.36s)]
*  which is called multiplex editing, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2972.16s)]
*  multiple edits across multiple genes [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2973.56s)]
*  that would actually change the biology of a plant [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2975.92s)]
*  in a fundamentally understandable way, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2978.44s)]
*  but that would ultimately drive [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2981.24s)]
*  such a transformative increase in yield, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2982.64s)]
*  it would open up entirely new opportunities in agriculture. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2985.24s)]
*  And so that was the moonshot, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2989.04s)]
*  was the series of edits that could, you know, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2990.16s)]
*  change how plants, you know, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2992.72s)]
*  do a specific set of things [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2995.16s)]
*  that makes their yield go up significantly. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2996.52s)]
*  And we weren't sure if it would work. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2998.6s)]
*  First of all, we weren't sure if it was possible [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=2999.8399999999997s)]
*  to do the edits. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3001.2799999999997s)]
*  Editing plants is very hard. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3003.4399999999996s)]
*  The cell wall of plants has to be dissolved. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3004.7599999999998s)]
*  And then you have to get the editing machinery [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3008.0s)]
*  into the plant, into the cell. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3009.3599999999997s)]
*  And then you have to get that cell to edit the right gene [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3011.08s)]
*  and not have other edits. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3013.8399999999997s)]
*  And then you have to get the cell to grow back into a plant. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3014.8799999999997s)]
*  There's so many complicated, difficult steps. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3017.16s)]
*  You have to get all of them to work. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3019.52s)]
*  And then we weren't even sure if making all those edits [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3021.36s)]
*  would cause the outcome that we expected. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3023.36s)]
*  And it turns out that it does. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3025.08s)]
*  And that happened as of a few weeks ago at this company. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3027.08s)]
*  And that's why I decided to step in. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3029.6400000000003s)]
*  Because suddenly it's like, oh my gosh, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3031.0s)]
*  the moonshot is working. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3032.4s)]
*  We put in a lot of capital, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3034.0s)]
*  we spent years funding the exercise, it's real. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3035.08s)]
*  And now we're gonna take off. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3038.52s)]
*  And so that's why I'm going all in on this. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3040.0s)]
*  So I'm being a little cagey with respect to the details. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3041.8s)]
*  As I understand it's top secret stuff, that's fine. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3044.36s)]
*  I definitely wanna talk more specifically [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3046.7200000000003s)]
*  about what the team's done [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3048.7200000000003s)]
*  and what we're gonna do with the business, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3049.96s)]
*  which I will happily do in a few months [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3051.84s)]
*  when some things become public. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3053.76s)]
*  But in the meantime, I'm excited to do it. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3056.44s)]
*  I gotta tell you, it's been seven years [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3058.04s)]
*  since I've been an operating CEO. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3061.0s)]
*  And to some degree, there's always been a piece missing [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3063.88s)]
*  for me in what I do every day [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3067.36s)]
*  that I haven't felt like I've had the ability [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3069.6000000000004s)]
*  to have the influence and make the decisions [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3071.48s)]
*  that I think need to be made. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3074.1600000000003s)]
*  You're advising the CEO, you're sitting in a board seat, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3075.0800000000004s)]
*  kind of encouraging them to do certain things. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3077.68s)]
*  But then sometimes they listen and sometimes they don't. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3080.6s)]
*  So to actually be in the seat feels to me [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3083.24s)]
*  like the right place. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3085.48s)]
*  It's the right place where I can have the influence [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3086.68s)]
*  and drive the change that I wanna see. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3088.48s)]
*  And I haven't done that in a very long time. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3090.48s)]
*  And so it's also personally, I think the right decision [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3093.3599999999997s)]
*  for me to find satisfaction in the work I'm doing, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3096.12s)]
*  not to mention the excitement I get out of the business. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3098.3599999999997s)]
*  And you and I have talked about this privately. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3100.3199999999997s)]
*  The world has too much capital. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3103.04s)]
*  There's just tons of money. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3105.3999999999996s)]
*  There's too many problems to be solved. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3106.64s)]
*  The real issue, especially when you're running an incubator [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3109.08s)]
*  or a startup studio, like some of these startup studios [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3113.16s)]
*  is who is going to pilot this very fast jet fighter [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3117.24s)]
*  and the number of people who are ambitious [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3123.3599999999997s)]
*  and technically know how to fly one of these planes [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3125.8799999999997s)]
*  and do it at high speed and want to take on [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3129.4s)]
*  that dangerous cockpit is very low. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3131.8799999999997s)]
*  And so I think it's very courageous of you [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3134.3599999999997s)]
*  to jump on and do this, so congratulations. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3135.92s)]
*  The point you're making is a really good one [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3137.8s)]
*  worth talking about just for a second. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3139.48s)]
*  There's been this criticism in Silicon Valley. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3141.2400000000002s)]
*  And I'd love your guys' point of view on this too, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3144.88s)]
*  Jamaf and Sachs and J-Cal, but there's been this criticism [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3147.2000000000003s)]
*  in Silicon Valley, which is that we do too much [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3150.84s)]
*  of the easy stuff and all the capital goes into the apps [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3153.48s)]
*  and stuff, things that are the path of least resistance [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3157.48s)]
*  to making money, not into the hard things [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3159.84s)]
*  that are low probability require a lot of capital. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3162.12s)]
*  It's not universally true, but it's generally true [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3164.24s)]
*  with respect to how capital is allocated. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3167.12s)]
*  And I was kind of talking with a bunch of people [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3169.72s)]
*  last week about this. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3171.9199999999996s)]
*  And I kind of realized that like, there's only, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3174.72s)]
*  if you're gonna do a difficult project [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3177.6s)]
*  that requires a lot of capital, you're gonna want to entrust [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3179.7999999999997s)]
*  that capital to someone that has proven themselves. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3182.8199999999997s)]
*  Someone who's proven themselves is generally gonna have [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3186.52s)]
*  the choice of things they're gonna want to do [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3190.2s)]
*  with their life. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3191.7599999999998s)]
*  And if they've proven themselves, it usually means [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3192.96s)]
*  they've had some exit event or some liquidity event [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3194.76s)]
*  that discourages them from doing a very difficult thing [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3197.36s)]
*  and taking on a lot of risk and burning themselves [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3200.32s)]
*  to death again when they've already made it. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3202.28s)]
*  And the people that have made it usually make it [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3205.0s)]
*  in software the first time around, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3206.8s)]
*  because software creates a path of least resistance [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3208.12s)]
*  to generating returns. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3210.7200000000003s)]
*  And then the challenging question for them is, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3213.2400000000002s)]
*  do you do it again and you make easy money? [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3216.16s)]
*  You know how to do it? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3219.02s)]
*  Or do you take a 5% shot or 2% shot of success, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3220.1s)]
*  98% chance of failure going after a very hard project [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3223.46s)]
*  that takes a very long period of time? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3227.2599999999998s)]
*  So I think that the challenge with difficult technology [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3228.7s)]
*  being developed in Silicon Valley is less about [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3232.98s)]
*  a dearth of capital or a dearth of ideas [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3236.94s)]
*  or a dearth of opportunities. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3238.94s)]
*  It's more about a dearth of talent. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3240.02s)]
*  That finding the right folks who have the capabilities [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3241.86s)]
*  and have done this before to want to step back [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3245.42s)]
*  into the saddle and take on a very large, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3248.46s)]
*  low probability problem is really the challenge [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3250.54s)]
*  that I see a lot of in getting a lot of these things [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3254.14s)]
*  kind of going and funded. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3256.9s)]
*  Hard to get people to be in the arena, yes, Chema? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3258.06s)]
*  You've seen this in your portfolio? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3260.64s)]
*  On a hard problem is what I'm saying. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3262.14s)]
*  On a hard problem, yes. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3262.98s)]
*  Like a 2% chance of success kind of problem. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3263.82s)]
*  Like why would I do that when I can go do something [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3265.94s)]
*  that I'm 60% likely to succeed at [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3268.18s)]
*  and do really well doing it? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3270.2200000000003s)]
*  I find that most companies are very under-managed [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3272.66s)]
*  and under-experienced and it's surprising for me. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3277.22s)]
*  It lacks a level of sophistication [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3281.1s)]
*  that I just assumed existed. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3283.7s)]
*  And I guess that's because my last experience [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3285.4599999999996s)]
*  was when I was helping to build a company [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3288.18s)]
*  that frankly, coming out of the great financial crisis, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3289.8199999999997s)]
*  we were recruiting people at Facebook from Google [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3293.98s)]
*  for the most part and then building an entire core [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3296.3399999999997s)]
*  of young people and grooming from within. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3299.7s)]
*  We had a pretty good go of it. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3304.18s)]
*  Fast forward to 2023 and I must admit that the companies [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3306.54s)]
*  that I interact with when I get into the weeds, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3310.42s)]
*  I think the real talent at Friedberg's point [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3315.1s)]
*  is spread too thin across too many businesses. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3316.94s)]
*  And so there are pockets of greatness in every company [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3320.02s)]
*  but there's no real gravitational pull [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3322.7799999999997s)]
*  for any of them as a result of that. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3326.22s)]
*  This is an excellent point as well. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3327.8999999999996s)]
*  When we had a SERP environment, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3329.46s)]
*  so many companies got funded. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3330.96s)]
*  An amazing CMO, CTO, VP of Ops started their own company [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3333.3399999999997s)]
*  and they were just, their natural position [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3339.06s)]
*  was the sixth man on the bench on the Knicks or the Warriors, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3341.4199999999996s)]
*  not the primary score. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3344.5s)]
*  They weren't Steph Curry. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3346.22s)]
*  They shouldn't be in that position. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3347.58s)]
*  They should be coming off the bench [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3348.8999999999996s)]
*  and being an amazing contributor. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3350.22s)]
*  This is, I've concluded, the best time in the world [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3351.7s)]
*  to start a new company. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3353.94s)]
*  I am absolutely amazed by the companies coming [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3354.94s)]
*  and applying for funding for us. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3359.8199999999997s)]
*  I understand because that's your business model [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3361.7s)]
*  but what about encouraging people [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3363.22s)]
*  to actually join a good company [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3364.4199999999996s)]
*  and learn how to be a good manager? [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3365.66s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3367.3199999999997s)]
*  These are the two best options, I think. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3368.16s)]
*  If you have two or three really great builders, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3370.8999999999996s)]
*  you actually know how to build. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3373.98s)]
*  In the two or three, you have a great idea [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3375.58s)]
*  and you want to do it, I encourage you to start a startup. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3377.22s)]
*  If you don't have a great idea, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3380.16s)]
*  you don't have two or three co-founders, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3381.14s)]
*  you don't wanna lead the thing, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3382.2999999999997s)]
*  find somebody who's just getting onto the launch pad [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3383.8199999999997s)]
*  or just getting a little escape velocity in their rocket, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3386.8199999999997s)]
*  which would be defined as 10 to 30 employees, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3389.06s)]
*  maybe having raised two to $20 million. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3393.46s)]
*  That's an ideal time to get on the rocket [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3396.46s)]
*  and just any seat you can get, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3399.22s)]
*  as Sheryl Sandberg said famously, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3401.54s)]
*  any seat on the rocket ship is a seat on the rocket ship. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3403.9s)]
*  We just wanna get on board, yeah, Shema? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3406.5s)]
*  I disagree with the first part of what you said. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3408.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, okay, explain why. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3410.68s)]
*  I run into two and three person teams every day [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3413.62s)]
*  that I think are exceptionally talented [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3416.5s)]
*  who should be inside of a company. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3419.34s)]
*  And instead they found somebody to give them money [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3421.18s)]
*  and so instead they're starting something [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3423.1s)]
*  and they're just meandering. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3424.54s)]
*  And the problem with these two and three person teams [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3426.1s)]
*  is that even now, if you stick the right label on it, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3428.8s)]
*  like AI, you'll find five or six or $7 million of money. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3431.94s)]
*  It won't be led by any single investor. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3437.34s)]
*  So it's all done in a safe. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3440.02s)]
*  None of these folks have boards. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3442.02s)]
*  And so they come in and check in with me time to time [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3444.14s)]
*  and I ask them about their progress and it's a mess. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3446.18s)]
*  And I'm shocked and I'm like, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3450.06s)]
*  why are you guys wasting your time? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3451.06s)]
*  Like you should be at a startup that's winning. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3452.5s)]
*  And part of it is that they think it's the right thing to do. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3455.04s)]
*  And I don't think there's any valor in being a founder. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3457.3399999999997s)]
*  I think there's a lot of valor in building something [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3461.3199999999997s)]
*  that's really valuable for people. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3464.06s)]
*  And if that means being a director of marketing, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3465.7s)]
*  go do that instead. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3467.56s)]
*  It's a valid point. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3469.46s)]
*  I think your most valid point in that is [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3470.62s)]
*  that there is not governance and mentorship [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3472.98s)]
*  during the peak ZERP era. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3476.7400000000002s)]
*  We created something called Founder University [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3479.26s)]
*  to kind of, it's a 12 week course [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3481.46s)]
*  where we teach people how to do this stuff. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3482.78s)]
*  And then we wind up investing in about 10% [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3484.18s)]
*  of those companies. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3486.06s)]
*  And it's nuts how many people are applying. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3487.26s)]
*  And we tell people when you hit $255,000 in revenue, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3490.0s)]
*  we'll start doing quarterly board meetings with you. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3495.06s)]
*  And they don't even have to be officially board meetings. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3498.5s)]
*  They're just mentoring sessions for one hour [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3500.18s)]
*  where you present as if it's a board. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3501.9s)]
*  And so I agree largely the passing of the hat [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3504.02s)]
*  and doing a party round and having no mentorship [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3507.42s)]
*  is a weakness in the system. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3510.7000000000003s)]
*  In our firm, we fixed it with Founder University. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3512.5s)]
*  Yeah, but isn't Trimotheming a slightly different point? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3514.78s)]
*  Jason, with respect. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3518.06s)]
*  Well, I think that when you have bubbly funding conditions, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3519.12s)]
*  it leads to an over fragmentation of talent. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3523.62s)]
*  Sure. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3526.3s)]
*  I mean, isn't that the point? [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3527.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3528.06s)]
*  I mean, it takes a certain concentration [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3528.9s)]
*  of outstanding people, not just founders, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3530.94s)]
*  but also early employees to create a great company. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3534.7400000000002s)]
*  And- No, it's PayPal, right? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3537.5s)]
*  I mean, that was the greatest concentration [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3538.7400000000002s)]
*  of talent in history. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3540.18s)]
*  The PayPal team was stacked with talent, right? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3541.02s)]
*  You have like- That and Google [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3542.54s)]
*  would be the two best examples, yeah. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3543.62s)]
*  Yeah, so one of the reasons why you can end up with, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3545.06s)]
*  again, an over fragmentation [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3549.34s)]
*  is if there is too much funding in the system [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3550.7400000000002s)]
*  and everybody's getting funded for really mid ideas, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3553.5s)]
*  and it prevents a congealing of great talent [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3558.9s)]
*  to come together at companies which have a really big idea. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3562.74s)]
*  If you believe that the startup ecosystem [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3566.1s)]
*  was overfunded during the Zerk bubble, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3569.18s)]
*  which it clearly was, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3571.38s)]
*  I mean, you don't just get bubbly valuations, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3573.02s)]
*  you also get bubbly funding conditions. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3575.62s)]
*  Then by definition, there are companies at the margins [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3578.42s)]
*  that are getting funded that shouldn't get funded, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3581.14s)]
*  and that leads to an over fragmentation of talent. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3582.94s)]
*  Here's what's happening on the ground. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3586.18s)]
*  We used to see a lot of solo founders outsourcing their tech. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3589.14s)]
*  What we're seeing now is usually two, three, four founders [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3592.1s)]
*  getting together to do a company. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3594.7s)]
*  And one of the counter prevailing forces here [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3596.3799999999997s)]
*  is what we saw with Spotify just laying off 1,700 people, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3601.2999999999997s)]
*  Google laying off 20,000, Facebook laying off, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3604.14s)]
*  I think, 25 or 30,000, Microsoft, Uber. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3606.98s)]
*  All these companies have laid off so massively, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3610.3399999999997s)]
*  they're all on hiring freezes. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3612.18s)]
*  So then what happens is [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3613.5s)]
*  there's massive amounts of talent at reasonable prices [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3614.86s)]
*  joining together after having worked at those companies. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3617.6600000000003s)]
*  And so I would say the companies we're funding [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3620.94s)]
*  at this early stage, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3622.98s)]
*  we're never doing solo founders, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3624.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean, unless it's a serial entrepreneur, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3626.6200000000003s)]
*  and we're seeing two or three people who worked at Uber [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3628.02s)]
*  or Google or Airbnb, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3629.94s)]
*  who have this really great product velocity coming together [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3632.7000000000003s)]
*  and they have to be builders. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3636.3s)]
*  So I think two things are true at once. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3637.94s)]
*  The number of companies being funded has plummeted, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3640.02s)]
*  I think, about 75% sacks, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3641.98s)]
*  but the quality and the amount of concentration of talent, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3644.34s)]
*  even in those startup cohorts, is really high. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3647.34s)]
*  And they don't have four job offers from Big Tech. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3650.1800000000003s)]
*  They're not having like a Salesforce $300,000 offer [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3653.1000000000004s)]
*  coming in or a Google $400,000 offer coming in. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3656.2200000000003s)]
*  So I think this is gonna be the best vintage of venture [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3658.6800000000003s)]
*  in our lifetimes. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3661.34s)]
*  That's my personal belief. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3662.44s)]
*  I invested in 100 companies this year. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3663.38s)]
*  But I could be wrong. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3666.7200000000003s)]
*  We should talk about the Google Gemini launch. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3667.6200000000003s)]
*  Google just dropped their chat GPT killer [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3671.0600000000004s)]
*  and from my perspective, it's awesome. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3673.78s)]
*  Just two quick videos here. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3676.86s)]
*  It does have very strong multimodal mode [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3679.5s)]
*  if you don't know what that is. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3681.8s)]
*  Just means you can use images, videos, text, input, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3683.1800000000003s)]
*  and output. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3685.94s)]
*  In this demo that you're seeing on the screen, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3687.0800000000004s)]
*  if you're watching the show, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3689.1200000000003s)]
*  they take a picture of a physics test [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3690.1800000000003s)]
*  that somebody took in handwriting. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3693.02s)]
*  They find which answers are wrong. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3695.02s)]
*  They explain it. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3696.7000000000003s)]
*  Lots of reasoning going on in here. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3697.5800000000004s)]
*  And obviously the multimodal means you're seeing an image [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3699.6400000000003s)]
*  and you're getting text back. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3702.46s)]
*  Second video they showed [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3704.2200000000003s)]
*  and they launched a lot of stuff today [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3706.14s)]
*  with this Gemini brand. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3708.06s)]
*  They're using the classic example of doing a party, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3710.5s)]
*  planning a party. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3714.58s)]
*  They use my likeness in the Google video. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3715.42s)]
*  Wait, what's going on? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3717.06s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3717.9s)]
*  There's Chubby Chamath. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3718.7400000000002s)]
*  Oops, sorry. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3719.86s)]
*  I can't body shape people. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3720.7s)]
*  Sorry about that, folks. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3721.7s)]
*  There's Chubby Chamath. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3723.3s)]
*  Please strike that. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3724.98s)]
*  Oh my God, I shouldn't have said that. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3725.82s)]
*  I thought Vinny Lingham was Fat Chamath. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3726.86s)]
*  Vinny Lingham has claimed Fat Chamath. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3729.3s)]
*  That's why I went for Chubby. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3731.2200000000003s)]
*  I didn't want to infringe on his IP. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3732.14s)]
*  But anyhow, no, I'm gonna get canceled. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3735.02s)]
*  So in this video, the person asked to do a kids party. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3738.08s)]
*  What's very unique here is [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3741.46s)]
*  that it does the follow-up questions, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3742.62s)]
*  which is really interesting [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3744.06s)]
*  and understands reasoning and context, [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3745.54s)]
*  but it built a dynamic interface for this use case. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3746.7799999999997s)]
*  And it did like a pin board [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3750.74s)]
*  and a kind of Google-esque task lists [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3752.3399999999997s)]
*  and KPIs and all this other nonsense. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3756.2999999999997s)]
*  But behind all of this [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3758.8599999999997s)]
*  in the Gemini exceptionalism, I think, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3760.38s)]
*  is that they did all these benchmarks against a bunch of, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3762.82s)]
*  there's a bunch of tests and batteries of tests [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3766.2400000000002s)]
*  that language models use to prove how strong they are. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3768.58s)]
*  And Google says Gemini beat GPT-4, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3772.02s)]
*  the latest from OpenAI, in 30 out of 32 benchmarks. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3774.5s)]
*  This is gonna come in three flavors, Ultra Pro and Nano. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3777.94s)]
*  That's basically cost and strength. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3781.42s)]
*  And there's a lot more behind this, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3783.6600000000003s)]
*  but based on what I'm seeing, in my opinion, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3785.0s)]
*  I've been looking at this stuff every week [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3787.2200000000003s)]
*  with Sandeep and looking at all of the latest and greatest. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3789.38s)]
*  This feels like it is a leapfrog by about 20 or 30%, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3795.1400000000003s)]
*  if this is true. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3799.58s)]
*  But Friedberg, you looked at the original papers. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3800.5s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the underpinnings? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3802.82s)]
*  I talked about the UX and some of the reasoning. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3804.5s)]
*  What are you seeing? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3806.5s)]
*  And we'll consider this a flash on the fly science corner [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3807.7000000000003s)]
*  for all those Friedberg stands out there. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3811.86s)]
*  I haven't read the whole 60 pages, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3814.62s)]
*  but I looked at the performance charts [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3819.06s)]
*  and it's pretty damn impressive. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3820.74s)]
*  I feel, I used the demo, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3822.54s)]
*  but I feel like you're interacting with data from Star Trek. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3824.62s)]
*  You guys ever watch Star Trek? [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3828.46s)]
*  Next generation? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3829.66s)]
*  Look at the smile on your face. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3830.5s)]
*  You are so happy. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3831.3199999999997s)]
*  Your dream has come true from your childhood. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3832.16s)]
*  I mean, I was like, this is a lifelong dream. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3833.8199999999997s)]
*  I can finally have a chat with data. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3835.22s)]
*  It's like conversational, it's predictable, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3837.02s)]
*  in the sense that it kind of predicts the details [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3841.62s)]
*  that I might ask or might otherwise forget to ask, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3843.82s)]
*  fills them in. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3847.1000000000004s)]
*  There's some, I think really smart features of it. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3848.5800000000004s)]
*  And I think it says a lot that Google [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3851.9s)]
*  truly does have the muscle to compete [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3856.34s)]
*  and now is showing the way of us to do so, [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3859.9s)]
*  that they're actually putting this out there, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3863.2400000000002s)]
*  that they're willing to disrupt themselves, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3865.3s)]
*  cannibalize their own search business potentially [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3867.7000000000003s)]
*  in a way that everyone's been worried [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3871.26s)]
*  that they wouldn't be willing or able to do. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3874.2599999999998s)]
*  They'll figure out a way to monetize it later, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3876.2599999999998s)]
*  but they really are showing that they're willing [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3878.02s)]
*  to try and make the best product for users, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3879.66s)]
*  which has always been a core mantra for Google [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3882.98s)]
*  from the origins of the business, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3885.42s)]
*  focus on the user and all else will follow. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3887.86s)]
*  And everyone's been saying the last couple of years, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3890.3s)]
*  they're too focused on profit, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3892.38s)]
*  they're squeezing every nickel and dime out of every click [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3893.82s)]
*  and showing that they're willing to put this out there, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3897.5s)]
*  says a lot about the strategic imperative of the board [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3899.22s)]
*  and the leadership there. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3901.94s)]
*  So that makes a big difference, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3903.02s)]
*  the product seems really good, [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3904.42s)]
*  the scoring data seems incredible against GPT-4, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3905.8s)]
*  which is I think the key benchmark, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3909.62s)]
*  as we know, OpenAI has some new models [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3911.02s)]
*  that are coming to market. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3912.9s)]
*  Here, let's pull up the table of results, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3914.66s)]
*  but this shows gemini's performance against GPT-4 [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3916.72s)]
*  using a number of well-known metrics. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3920.24s)]
*  I'll say that there is no business on earth [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3922.22s)]
*  that has more data than Google. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3926.22s)]
*  YouTube is the richest data repository, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3928.5s)]
*  digital data repository on earth. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3931.54s)]
*  The YouTube data set gives Google [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3933.7799999999997s)]
*  an extraordinary advantage in training. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3936.02s)]
*  And clearly we're seeing that in the results [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3938.7799999999997s)]
*  they're getting on imaging and video here. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3940.18s)]
*  So, big, big, big announcement for Google, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3941.46s)]
*  I think it's definitely worth saying [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3944.58s)]
*  that they're in the game [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3946.38s)]
*  and it's gonna be pretty powerful to watch, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3947.86s)]
*  I think pretty important to watch. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3950.06s)]
*  Sax is free, Berks said the Cajones are on the table now, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3951.18s)]
*  Sundar has dropped the huevos. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3954.62s)]
*  What's your take? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3957.7799999999997s)]
*  I think it's pretty clear that Google's gonna be [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3958.6s)]
*  a major player in AI. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3960.1s)]
*  But the question is, are they gonna be dominant in AI? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3962.18s)]
*  And I think one of the points that our friend [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3965.2999999999997s)]
*  Brad Gerstner makes that's well taken [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3967.1s)]
*  about Google's market position is that [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3969.2599999999998s)]
*  if you look at their position in search, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3971.22s)]
*  which is gradually being replaced by AI, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3973.5s)]
*  they're absolutely dominant in search. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3976.8199999999997s)]
*  So even if they turn out to be good or great in AI, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3979.06s)]
*  their AI franchises is never gonna be as dominant [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3983.7799999999997s)]
*  as their search franchise was in that market. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3986.74s)]
*  And so to the extent that AI is replacing search, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3989.5s)]
*  and I think we're seeing that more and more, right? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3993.3s)]
*  If you can get the AI just to give you the answer [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3996.06s)]
*  instead of a list of 10 blue links, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=3998.62s)]
*  that's a better user experience. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4000.7s)]
*  So I think as more and more searches get replaced with AI, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4002.54s)]
*  it's just impossible that they're gonna maintain [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4005.9s)]
*  that same dominant share. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4007.78s)]
*  Moreover, it's really unclear how you monetize those, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4010.3s)]
*  let's call them AI searches, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4014.58s)]
*  where it just gives you the answer [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4016.06s)]
*  because nobody wants to get three ad links [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4017.66s)]
*  up at the top of their answer. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4021.5s)]
*  No one's gonna click on those. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4022.54s)]
*  So I think, look, Google is gonna be a player in AI, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4023.74s)]
*  but as AI displaces search, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4026.18s)]
*  it's gonna be a real challenge for them as a company, [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4029.18s)]
*  I think. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4031.2599999999998s)]
*  I have the opposite position, I'll explain, Sax. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4032.1s)]
*  While I do think you're right, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4034.74s)]
*  their dominance won't be the same, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4036.9s)]
*  having used the Google Flights AI integration, [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4039.18s)]
*  Google Shopping AI integration, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4043.54s)]
*  that's in Bard right now, which is very like 1.0, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4045.22s)]
*  or even 0.1. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4048.3s)]
*  I think the number of searches [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4049.14s)]
*  or the number of interactions, the number of queries, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4050.78s)]
*  let's call them, questions asked, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4053.1s)]
*  is gonna go like 10, 20, 50, 100X. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4054.7s)]
*  I think people are gonna be talking to their AIs [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4057.94s)]
*  all day long. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4059.66s)]
*  And where I think you might be wrong is, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4060.82s)]
*  I think actually the clicks are gonna fit [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4062.42s)]
*  in certain categories perfectly into the response. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4064.9s)]
*  So in this birthday one, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4067.3s)]
*  if you had a bunch of ideas of what you could click on [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4069.02s)]
*  to purchase, if it said, hey, great idea for the birthday, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4072.7s)]
*  did you think about these hats? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4075.14s)]
*  Did you think about these pinatas? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4076.58s)]
*  Did you think about these places to get cake? [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4077.86s)]
*  And those were all paid, and AI informed them [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4079.7799999999997s)]
*  because you wanna do an animal-based jungle party, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4082.34s)]
*  and it showed you those. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4085.06s)]
*  It's going to make unbelievable ad targeting [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4086.18s)]
*  that is right into your planning. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4091.02s)]
*  Hey, get these hats here, get this flight here, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4092.98s)]
*  book this restaurant. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4095.86s)]
*  I think it could be a goldmine, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4096.82s)]
*  and I think the clickstream and the ad network [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4099.26s)]
*  is gonna fit perfectly into it. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4102.26s)]
*  Same thing with those questions being asked, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4104.66s)]
*  and hey, do you wanna get a math tutor? [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4107.9s)]
*  Do you wanna buy this book, et cetera? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4110.099999999999s)]
*  So I'm gonna take the other side of it. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4112.0599999999995s)]
*  Chamath, where do you land? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4114.22s)]
*  Are you short, long, or neutral, Google, based on this? [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4115.42s)]
*  I think that there's two important things [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4118.78s)]
*  to notice about this. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4121.58s)]
*  The first is who is in charge of this project. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4124.46s)]
*  And this is, I think, after they did that reorg, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4128.28s)]
*  the most important person in all of this is Jeff Dean, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4131.18s)]
*  who, if you look back, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4134.780000000001s)]
*  is one of the most preeminent technical lights, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4138.18s)]
*  frankly, of the internet, but within, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4140.06s)]
*  Google is just a giant, right? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4143.3s)]
*  So TensorFlow, MapReduce, BigTable, Spanner, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4144.9400000000005s)]
*  the guy is just an absolute animal. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4148.38s)]
*  He's proven an ability to not just conceptualize big ideas, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4150.9400000000005s)]
*  but then get them to market in a way [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4155.3s)]
*  that can work at scale, right? [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4156.9800000000005s)]
*  That's the first thing. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4159.22s)]
*  The second thing is that this gemini is a collaboration [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4160.06s)]
*  between DeepMind for the first time and Google Research [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4162.62s)]
*  and a bunch of other people at Google. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4165.42s)]
*  So I think Freeberg mentioned this before, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4166.66s)]
*  the test for Google is not their technical capacity, [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4169.14s)]
*  but their ability to organize everybody [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4172.94s)]
*  and get them to row in the same direction. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4174.86s)]
*  So I think that that's really important. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4177.9s)]
*  My takeaway is what I kind of put out on Twitter, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4182.44s)]
*  which is that I think all of this [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4186.98s)]
*  is one more brick in the wall on this theme of commoditization. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4189.7s)]
*  So we have all of these really interesting [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4195.7s)]
*  foundational models. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4198.62s)]
*  If you just look back a little bit, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4199.54s)]
*  Lama 2's advances have been pretty amazing. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4201.58s)]
*  Out of the UAE, Abu Dhabi, the government there showed some, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4205.38s)]
*  Falcon, which showed some really interesting promise. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4210.74s)]
*  Obviously, OpenAI is doing some great work [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4214.92s)]
*  with GPT-4 and GPT-5. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4217.0599999999995s)]
*  Now you see Gemini and the results that they're generating. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4219.5s)]
*  There's going to be a proliferation of foundational models. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4225.3s)]
*  The cost of those models will go to zero. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4228.66s)]
*  And so why is that an important thing? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4232.1s)]
*  Well, one, it's good for the ecosystem. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4235.22s)]
*  Two, it's really good for developers. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4238.14s)]
*  And three, it allows us to then figure out [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4240.78s)]
*  where the real value is going to be made. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4243.54s)]
*  And I think the value is in taking these models [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4245.42s)]
*  and wrapping them with cheap, abstracted hardware. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4247.82s)]
*  You can't have an economy get built in AI [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4251.66s)]
*  when you have year-long waiting lists [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4255.34s)]
*  for H100s and A100s from Nvidia. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4257.78s)]
*  That's not possible. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4259.98s)]
*  So that entire layer as well will get commoditized. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4261.299999999999s)]
*  So the folks that are the AWSs, the Azures, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4264.38s)]
*  and the GCPs of the world, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4267.0199999999995s)]
*  or these next generation entrants [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4268.34s)]
*  who are building AI clouds, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4271.78s)]
*  those folks I think will make money. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4274.36s)]
*  And then the apps will make money. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4276.06s)]
*  So I think it's a very good thing. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4278.46s)]
*  I think that you don't want a lot of the lock-in [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4280.02s)]
*  that Nvidia was trying to create. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4282.620000000001s)]
*  They were trying to create essentially a walled garden [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4283.9800000000005s)]
*  where you have to use CUDA in order to basically compile [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4286.02s)]
*  to these miles to their chips. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4289.1s)]
*  It's going to break all of that. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4292.02s)]
*  So I'm generally quite constructive. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4293.740000000001s)]
*  I think that this is a really good step [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4295.54s)]
*  in democratizing this whole thing [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4298.580000000001s)]
*  and letting the value accrete to the ends. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4300.9400000000005s)]
*  It's a barbell. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4304.620000000001s)]
*  Infrastructure providers and app builders, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4306.46s)]
*  that's my best guess of where money gets made here. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4307.54s)]
*  All right. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4310.04s)]
*  Adobe's $20 billion acquisition of Figma is stalled. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4310.88s)]
*  Right now, UK CMA stands for Competition [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4314.62s)]
*  and Markets Authority has effectively blocked [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4318.42s)]
*  this acquisition for a couple of obvious reasons. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4321.38s)]
*  One, reduces innovation. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4325.58s)]
*  Two, it eliminates competition between two top competitors [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4327.74s)]
*  in product design. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4330.48s)]
*  And three, removes Figma as a threat to Adobe's Photoshop [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4331.62s)]
*  and Illustrator products. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4334.82s)]
*  CMA mentions some potential remedies, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4337.9s)]
*  divesting of overlapping operations in each market [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4341.0199999999995s)]
*  where the deal could cause less competition [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4344.099999999999s)]
*  or just prohibiting the merger entirely. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4347.94s)]
*  Feels like that's what's going to happen. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4350.9s)]
*  And also- [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4354.82s)]
*  Actually, I have to take issue with- [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4355.66s)]
*  That was a peak Zerp, right? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4356.5s)]
*  That was a peak Zerp deal. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4357.34s)]
*  No, hold on. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4358.34s)]
*  I have to take issue with you said [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4359.179999999999s)]
*  that they are doing this for obvious reasons. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4360.38s)]
*  I don't think these reasons are obvious [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4363.26s)]
*  in the sense that I don't think they speak for themselves. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4365.9400000000005s)]
*  I think they have to be defended. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4368.26s)]
*  And I don't think these are good reasons. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4370.820000000001s)]
*  Oh yeah, no. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4373.5s)]
*  When I say obvious reasons, I'm not endorsing them. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4375.46s)]
*  I'm just saying the standard reasons of lack of competition [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4377.74s)]
*  and consolidation of competitors. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4382.38s)]
*  So, but yeah, expand on your point [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4384.46s)]
*  and you think it should not be stopped, this merger? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4387.62s)]
*  Well, first of all, this merger was originally announced, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4392.22s)]
*  I think back on September 15th of 2022, over a year ago. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4395.9400000000005s)]
*  What is that? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4400.1s)]
*  That's almost 15 months ago. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4400.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4404.1s)]
*  So this is a ridiculous amount of time [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4404.9400000000005s)]
*  for regulators to take to figure out [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4407.26s)]
*  whether they're going to approve the deal. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4408.9400000000005s)]
*  That's no good for anybody. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4410.06s)]
*  I think businesses, whether you're Adobe, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4411.34s)]
*  whether you're Figma have a right [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4414.06s)]
*  to have these questions answered much more quickly. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4415.820000000001s)]
*  So what are the regulators doing? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4418.900000000001s)]
*  So that's point number one. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4420.26s)]
*  Point number two is that it's mostly the UK regulator, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4421.7s)]
*  which is called the CMA or Competition and Markets [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4425.62s)]
*  Authority. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4428.26s)]
*  They're the ones who are dragging their feet [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4429.42s)]
*  and holding this up. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4431.62s)]
*  So Figma and Adobe have to get the approval [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4433.0199999999995s)]
*  of three different regulatory bodies. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4436.42s)]
*  They have to get approval in the United States [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4438.62s)]
*  from, I think, the DOJ. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4440.74s)]
*  They have to get approval from the EU with Brussels. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4442.46s)]
*  And now, because of things to Brexit, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4446.099999999999s)]
*  they also have to get approved by the UK. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4448.42s)]
*  And to me, it's a little crazy that one country's competition [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4451.900000000001s)]
*  authority, the UK, which is not, in the grand scheme of things, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4457.18s)]
*  that big a market, can hold up this entire deal. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4460.22s)]
*  It should be faster, of course. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4463.9800000000005s)]
*  They should have a certain number of days. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4465.82s)]
*  I question whether one country, the UK, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4467.22s)]
*  should be able to hold up a deal if the US and the EU approve it. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4470.02s)]
*  And one thing I would say to startups [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4474.42s)]
*  is if the CMA is going to start holding up [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4475.94s)]
*  deals for a bunch of novel reasons, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4479.58s)]
*  meaning reasons that haven't previously been articulated [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4482.74s)]
*  before in an entry trust law, why in the world [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4485.74s)]
*  would you want to create nexus with the UK? [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4488.379999999999s)]
*  I think this pertains to all the startup ecosystem. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4491.139999999999s)]
*  Because look, I remember when I was doing Yammer, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4493.259999999999s)]
*  we decided to open an office in Europe, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4495.379999999999s)]
*  and we decided to settle in London. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4497.379999999999s)]
*  And we created a pretty big office in London. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4499.82s)]
*  We thought that was the best place for a startup to locate. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4502.339999999999s)]
*  If you had told me at the time that that would subject [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4505.34s)]
*  our acquisition by Microsoft to the CMA over there, [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4509.3s)]
*  and that they would take some novel interpretation [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4513.7s)]
*  and come hold up my deal, there's no way [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4515.46s)]
*  I would have wanted to open an office in the UK. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4517.78s)]
*  So let's be clear about that. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4520.74s)]
*  Now, I want to move on just quickly to the argument [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4522.1s)]
*  that the CMA is making. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4525.42s)]
*  And I do think it's a novel argument. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4526.74s)]
*  They're not saying that Adobe and Figma are competitive today. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4528.9400000000005s)]
*  And actually, I think they are operating in different markets. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4533.86s)]
*  Figma is a product for web designers and web developers. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4536.7s)]
*  And the end state of a Figma design is code. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4542.299999999999s)]
*  If you look at Adobe's products like Photoshop, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4545.58s)]
*  the end state is marketing collateral. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4548.54s)]
*  It's a marketing design product. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4550.46s)]
*  Nobody uses Figma to create marketing collateral. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4552.86s)]
*  They use Photoshop. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4557.38s)]
*  And nobody who's using Photoshop is using that [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4559.42s)]
*  to build websites. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4563.38s)]
*  These are, in practice, pretty distinct markets. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4565.78s)]
*  And I think the CMA has conceded that they're [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4568.78s)]
*  distinct and separate markets. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4572.42s)]
*  But what the CMA is trying to say is that at some point [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4574.06s)]
*  in the future, if we block this deal, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4577.66s)]
*  Figma might compete with Adobe. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4580.5s)]
*  They might create a competitor to Photoshop. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4585.78s)]
*  And that is a bogus rationale for blocking a deal. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4588.26s)]
*  Because first of all, I think we all know that Figma has no [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4591.5s)]
*  interest in competing with Photoshop. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4594.66s)]
*  They're not going to compete. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4597.06s)]
*  They're much more interested in AI. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4598.42s)]
*  They're much more interested in doing things like prompt [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4600.46s)]
*  to design to code. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4602.9s)]
*  They're not interested in building a Photoshop competitor. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4604.58s)]
*  And there's no reason to believe that they would do that. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4608.7s)]
*  Moreover, that is not an objective standard. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4611.12s)]
*  Think about it. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4613.42s)]
*  If you can block a deal on the grounds [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4614.38s)]
*  that these two companies don't compete today [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4616.62s)]
*  but might one day compete in the future, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4618.62s)]
*  it gives the regulators a veto over any deal. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4621.66s)]
*  And that is not the way antitrust is supposed to work. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4624.54s)]
*  The way that antitrust has historically worked [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4626.78s)]
*  is you define what market these companies are in, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4628.94s)]
*  and you add their market share together [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4633.26s)]
*  if they're both in the same market [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4635.5s)]
*  to see if it would create an undue monopoly or oligopoly, [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4637.38s)]
*  some dynamic like that. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4642.5s)]
*  It was a market share test, which is an objective test. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4643.58s)]
*  This is not an objective test. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4647.52s)]
*  This is a regulator saying, hmm, we [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4649.320000000001s)]
*  know you don't compete today, but one day in the future [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4651.320000000001s)]
*  you might. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4653.56s)]
*  That is bogus. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4654.8s)]
*  So if you allow the CMA to block this deal on that ground, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4656.160000000001s)]
*  they can block any deal for any reason. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4658.8s)]
*  And then on top of it, they've taken 15 months [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4660.88s)]
*  to come down with this opinion. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4663.240000000001s)]
*  I think this is going to have a very chilling effect on M&A [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4665.96s)]
*  activity for not a good reason, for not a good reason. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4668.6s)]
*  And that is the last thing the Starb ecosystem needs right now. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4672.76s)]
*  I'm going to agree about the time. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4676.84s)]
*  I'm going to agree that we should [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4679.92s)]
*  let a little more M&A happen. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4682.88s)]
*  I'll disagree. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4684.24s)]
*  Adobe has a product, XD, competes directly with Figma. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4685.28s)]
*  And then I've gotten multiple designers [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4688.4800000000005s)]
*  who have included me in Figma designs for things [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4691.0s)]
*  that are other than interfaces. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4694.08s)]
*  They're using it for decks. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4695.84s)]
*  They're using it for marketing collateral. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4697.08s)]
*  And if you go look at Figma's templates offering, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4699.76s)]
*  they are all Photoshop, Illustrator, key functions. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4703.08s)]
*  So in the market, even though the products were not [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4706.04s)]
*  designed as competitors, designers [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4708.32s)]
*  are starting with Figma for many design projects [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4710.0s)]
*  in my direct experience and by looking at the templates. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4712.64s)]
*  So I'll disagree on that third point. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4715.28s)]
*  Shamath, your take. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4716.6s)]
*  Well, hold on. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4717.44s)]
*  I got to do a fact check on one thing. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4718.24s)]
*  You're right that Adobe had a competitive product [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4720.12s)]
*  to Figma called XD. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4722.2s)]
*  They shut it down. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4723.6s)]
*  They shut it down. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4725.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4726.08s)]
*  It was a failure. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4727.0s)]
*  So they are out of the market for a web design tool. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4728.16s)]
*  They're out. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4731.4s)]
*  So that argument no longer exists. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4732.64s)]
*  And I don't know if they shut it down because of this deal [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4734.8s)]
*  or because it was failing anyway, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4736.76s)]
*  but they solved that problem. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4738.400000000001s)]
*  Now with respect to these use cases where, OK, yeah, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4740.0s)]
*  you're talking anecdotally, Jason, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4743.96s)]
*  about you've seen some web designer use Figma. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4745.76s)]
*  No, I'm talking factually. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4749.84s)]
*  Go look at the templates. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4750.92s)]
*  I just put the link in there. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4751.96s)]
*  It's still anecdotal. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4752.96s)]
*  It's not based on a market share test. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4754.0s)]
*  If you want to make this argument that Figma and Photoshop [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4755.6s)]
*  are competitive products, break it down [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4759.96s)]
*  in terms of market share. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4761.96s)]
*  That's my point. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4763.12s)]
*  Add up Figma's market share in the market [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4764.0s)]
*  for marketing collateral and see if that would [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4766.24s)]
*  create undue concentration. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4768.64s)]
*  Fair enough. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4770.2s)]
*  My objection is that they're not basing this decision, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4771.0s)]
*  if it can even be called a decision. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4774.64s)]
*  I think it's more like just concerns and dragging [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4776.32s)]
*  their feet. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4778.92s)]
*  But they are basing their concerns on something [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4780.04s)]
*  that's unquantifiable. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4783.6s)]
*  And I do think that antitrust decisions should be quantifiable. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4785.76s)]
*  The concerning thing here is that this [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4789.6s)]
*  is on the heels of Activision and Microsoft, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4792.32s)]
*  which was equally protracted and drawn out. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4794.5199999999995s)]
*  I think it's bad for capital markets [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4797.4s)]
*  when deals that are offered up just linger for 15, 18 months. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4799.639999999999s)]
*  I don't think that that's healthy. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4805.639999999999s)]
*  It causes a lot of pause amongst investors. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4806.96s)]
*  And it probably freezes both Adobe and Figma [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4812.48s)]
*  from investing the way that they would if they [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4815.4s)]
*  knew that this thing was voted up or down in three months [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4818.5199999999995s)]
*  or whatever. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4820.96s)]
*  So I think that I totally agree with you [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4821.48s)]
*  that there needs to be an SLA around these things. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4824.719999999999s)]
*  And you can't take this much time. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4827.48s)]
*  I breezed through the CMA report. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4830.08s)]
*  My gosh, it's 400 pages. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4834.679999999999s)]
*  That's insane. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4837.799999999999s)]
*  A 400 page document is like, it's a little outlandish. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4838.48s)]
*  But I wanted to call out two parts of that document. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4841.48s)]
*  One is in support, Sax, of what you said. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4844.5599999999995s)]
*  Nick, you can just throw it up here. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4848.28s)]
*  What they said was that in assessing [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4849.78s)]
*  the competitive effects of the merger, [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4851.259999999999s)]
*  we must decide whether there is an expectation, i.e. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4853.3s)]
*  more than 50% chance that the merger will result [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4856.46s)]
*  in diminished competition. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4859.0199999999995s)]
*  Now, that's like a little nuts. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4860.98s)]
*  Because David, as you said, it's like, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4862.9s)]
*  we're going to take an expected probability and a guess [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4864.66s)]
*  into the future about what we think will happen. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4867.0199999999995s)]
*  And I think that that's not a fair way of doing business. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4870.0199999999995s)]
*  I think that you have to look at what will happen when [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4873.98s)]
*  this happens and judge on its face. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4876.179999999999s)]
*  You can't say, well, also, by the way, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4879.42s)]
*  I expect that you guys will be intelligent and really execute [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4881.06s)]
*  so that it'll just increase the odds. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4884.3s)]
*  That's not right. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4885.72s)]
*  That's what business is. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4886.38s)]
*  So if I had to steel man the pro-Figma side, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4888.58s)]
*  I would say that that's unreasonable. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4891.22s)]
*  The second side on the pro-Figma side [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4893.3s)]
*  is there's this long point here. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4894.78s)]
*  I think it's like number 27 or 28 in this document. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4896.54s)]
*  And this is what's crazy. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4899.7s)]
*  It basically says, hey, we went through document discovery. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4900.78s)]
*  We found some emails that basically [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4905.58s)]
*  by Adobe that said we did market analyses. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4908.84s)]
*  We didn't think we were doing very well. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4912.24s)]
*  And I think it's important to note for the CMA [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4914.76s)]
*  that this is what 100 years of MBA classes [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4917.0s)]
*  have taught people to do. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4920.72s)]
*  I mean, you teach executives that go work at companies [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4922.16s)]
*  to do what's called a SWOT analysis to figure out [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4925.96s)]
*  what are the risks and opportunities for your business [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4929.04s)]
*  and then to go and invest to fix them. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4931.38s)]
*  That's capitalism and that's business theory [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4934.6s)]
*  and we've taught executives at every single company [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4937.1s)]
*  to do this. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4940.820000000001s)]
*  That can't be illegal, meaning to use your brain [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4941.820000000001s)]
*  inside of a business to realize [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4944.9400000000005s)]
*  that what you did isn't working. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4946.38s)]
*  So that's also, I would say, sacks in support [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4947.72s)]
*  of what you're saying, which is it's taking too long, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4950.780000000001s)]
*  it's speculative, and you're punishing people [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4954.14s)]
*  for actually being good business people. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4956.900000000001s)]
*  And I don't think that makes sense. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4958.22s)]
*  What's the number, six months? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4959.54s)]
*  Just to add to that, again, like an important overlay here [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4961.26s)]
*  is that the CMA is the UK's regulator [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4966.18s)]
*  and they're the smallest market. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4970.54s)]
*  The GDP of the UK is three trillion. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4971.900000000001s)]
*  The GDP of the EU is 16 trillion. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4974.02s)]
*  The GDP of the US is, I forget, [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4976.62s)]
*  it's in the 20, 25 trillion range. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4979.02s)]
*  So you've got the toughest regulator [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4981.16s)]
*  who is coming up with the most novel legal theory. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4984.240000000001s)]
*  I think it's worth exploring that these regulators, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4986.5s)]
*  I think, are working in conjunction [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4989.9800000000005s)]
*  and those fingerprints looked a little bit more obvious. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4993.34s)]
*  I'm not playing conspiracy theorists, [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4996.860000000001s)]
*  but it looks like the EU, the FTC, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=4998.18s)]
*  and the CMA did work together. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5001.66s)]
*  I don't know how officially or not. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5005.34s)]
*  In Microsoft Activision, it looked relatively coordinated. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5006.9400000000005s)]
*  I suspect that it stands to reason that they're in touch [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5010.7s)]
*  and they talk about these deals [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5013.68s)]
*  and their combined perspectives. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5014.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't know how else you just generate a 400 page report [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5016.38s)]
*  with this kind of specificity [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5019.400000000001s)]
*  unless there's some amount of collaboration [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5020.62s)]
*  and sharing, which, by the way, I think does make sense. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5023.299999999999s)]
*  I think it does make sense to coordinate your point of view. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5025.7s)]
*  But I think I agree with you, David. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5029.299999999999s)]
*  But we don't know that for sure. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5031.82s)]
*  I mean, all I know is that in the press reports [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5032.86s)]
*  it's been about the CMA. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5036.139999999999s)]
*  It's possible that the EU or, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5037.879999999999s)]
*  I don't think US will do this [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5039.7s)]
*  because that would just be like [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5040.86s)]
*  inventing a whole new antitrust law, right? [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5042.82s)]
*  No, I understand. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5044.86s)]
*  I'm just saying that my point of view is that, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5046.62s)]
*  as a business owner, my response to this [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5048.98s)]
*  would be to gatekeep the app in these geographies [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5051.64s)]
*  so that I don't create a nexus if I ever get bought. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5055.08s)]
*  Bingo. That's my point. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5057.400000000001s)]
*  That's exactly my point is that the smallest market [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5058.400000000001s)]
*  is creating the most problems for this merger. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5061.400000000001s)]
*  So assuming they're kind of on their own in this [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5063.88s)]
*  and the EU doesn't just copy it, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5067.84s)]
*  if you're right, if they copy it, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5069.400000000001s)]
*  then Figment and Adobe have a bigger problem. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5070.84s)]
*  I think that's what's gonna happen. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5073.6s)]
*  Right, then maybe the EU does copy it, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5075.18s)]
*  but right now the CMA is way ahead of any other regulator [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5076.88s)]
*  in terms of a novel theory. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5080.94s)]
*  So what I'm saying is, if you're a company, [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5082.0599999999995s)]
*  why would you subject yourself to that [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5084.24s)]
*  when it's so easy to avoid their market? [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5086.0s)]
*  No, I think it fundamentally hurts UK productivity [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5087.5s)]
*  over the long run because I don't see how companies, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5091.139999999999s)]
*  if they can't A, get a reasonable SLA for a response [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5093.98s)]
*  and then B, get a reasonable document [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5098.139999999999s)]
*  that's not gonna require $50 million of lawyers [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5101.54s)]
*  and consultants to read, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5104.96s)]
*  to do business in a country just goes down, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5106.98s)]
*  the incentives to do a business in a country. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5108.78s)]
*  So now if you steel man the other side, [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5111.72s)]
*  I actually think it's very difficult to steel man [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5114.96s)]
*  why this is bad for competition. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5117.6s)]
*  I think the only steel man is more [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5119.24s)]
*  from the economic shareholder perspective of Adobe, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5121.0s)]
*  which is could they have paid a different price? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5123.28s)]
*  What does that, because I think it's a mixture [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5125.4400000000005s)]
*  of cash and stocks, so that's changed [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5126.96s)]
*  because Adobe's rallied a lot and is that price worth it? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5128.6s)]
*  But that's again, not a reason to use a regulator [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5131.68s)]
*  to run a deal to the ground, right? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5136.360000000001s)]
*  Adobe should just man up and talk to Dylan [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5139.28s)]
*  and say, here's the new price, [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5141.599999999999s)]
*  otherwise here's a billion dollars. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5142.84s)]
*  I don't think Adobe is driving it in that way. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5144.5s)]
*  I mean, by all accounts, Figma as a business [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5146.28s)]
*  is still doing very well, [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5148.639999999999s)]
*  even if they paid too high a price 15 months ago, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5149.8s)]
*  they've partially grown into that valuation already. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5153.24s)]
*  I don't think Adobe is driving this. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5156.24s)]
*  I really think that the CMA is driving this. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5157.8s)]
*  I think there's a regulator [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5160.24s)]
*  who wants to pioneer a novel legal theory. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5161.5599999999995s)]
*  And in a weird way, I mean, it's not, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5164.16s)]
*  have you ever seen like a pack of dogs [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5166.48s)]
*  where you've got like a Great Dane and a Doberman [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5167.96s)]
*  and then a Chihuahua and the Chihuahua's trying [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5171.0s)]
*  to leave the pack? [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5173.2s)]
*  The CMA is like the Chihuahua and it's like barking [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5174.04s)]
*  the loudest and trying to shepherd all the other dogs. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5177.8s)]
*  Yapping dog, you got a yappy little Chihuahua here. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5180.8s)]
*  The issue that you bring up, Sax, is that- [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5184.36s)]
*  The US is a Great Dane and the EU is a big dog too. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5186.2s)]
*  And yeah. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5189.68s)]
*  But it is, if the EU and the United States follow suit, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5191.16s)]
*  it will, it's just death by a thousand cuts, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5194.84s)]
*  meaning it will require a Brad Smith like character [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5197.28s)]
*  inside of this company who can go and work with regulators [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5201.24s)]
*  to really get it done. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5205.28s)]
*  And this is the brilliance of him at Microsoft is [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5206.639999999999s)]
*  when you look at the track record of his ability, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5212.44s)]
*  post this consent decree to get deals done [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5215.8s)]
*  inside of Microsoft, it's truly incredible. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5218.0s)]
*  There is nothing that they've really tried to buy, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5221.28s)]
*  whether it's Nuance or whether it's Mojang [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5223.56s)]
*  or whether it's GitHub, Activision, LinkedIn, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5227.92s)]
*  they've gotten it all done. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5233.04s)]
*  They're around the table. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5234.4400000000005s)]
*  Do we really want to create an economic system [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5235.280000000001s)]
*  where whether a deal gets through is completely arbitrary [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5237.240000000001s)]
*  because there's no longer a quantitative test [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5240.8s)]
*  and the regulators can just pause it, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5242.6s)]
*  that at some point in the future, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5244.280000000001s)]
*  these companies may be competitive. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5245.320000000001s)]
*  No, the answers don't. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5246.76s)]
*  And it takes, and furthermore, in order to get past [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5247.6s)]
*  the regulators who have a completely subjective standard, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5250.76s)]
*  you need like a political genius, like a Brad Smith. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5254.56s)]
*  I mean, that is like the definition of crony capitalism, [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5257.2s)]
*  right, is that you get your deal done [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5261.320000000001s)]
*  if you got a Brad Smith and you don't get it done [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5263.280000000001s)]
*  if you're a startup like Figma. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5266.04s)]
*  That's not the system we want to be in. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5267.72s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5269.52s)]
*  Three important things. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5271.400000000001s)]
*  One, future competition is a stupid test. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5272.240000000001s)]
*  Number two, just put six months on this. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5275.280000000001s)]
*  It's not even future, it's their assessment [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5277.240000000001s)]
*  of the probability of future competition. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5279.12s)]
*  Which is just dumb. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5281.68s)]
*  This is pre-COGS in Minority Report. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5283.28s)]
*  Figma could sign an affidavit today saying that [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5285.8s)]
*  we're not gonna build Photoshop. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5290.44s)]
*  We're not building it, yeah. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5292.12s)]
*  It's not our roadmap. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5292.96s)]
*  It's not even an affidavit. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5294.36s)]
*  You could go through, you could conduct discovery [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5295.8s)]
*  on the question of whether Figma [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5299.24s)]
*  has ever even discussed internally, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5301.5199999999995s)]
*  whether they should compete with Photoshop, right? [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5303.84s)]
*  Because you don't just launch a Photoshop competitor [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5305.92s)]
*  out of the blue. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5308.04s)]
*  You probably discuss it for a while. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5309.72s)]
*  So they could conduct discovery on that question. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5310.64s)]
*  I guarantee you Figma does not have robust conversations [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5313.64s)]
*  in discovery about competing with Photoshop. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5317.400000000001s)]
*  That's not where their interest is. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5319.24s)]
*  And then also they should have a six month clock [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5321.64s)]
*  to do this and then if I'm Adobe and Figma, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5325.32s)]
*  I would say, I would pull a Zuck. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5329.400000000001s)]
*  When they came at Zuck and said, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5331.64s)]
*  you have to pay for news in Australia, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5333.0s)]
*  you have to pay for news in Canada, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5334.8s)]
*  remember these two government overreaches [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5336.2s)]
*  that you couldn't even put a link to a news story. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5339.4s)]
*  He's like, okay, fine, we're just gonna not include links [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5341.5599999999995s)]
*  to the New York Times and feeds, that's not allowed. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5343.44s)]
*  They should just say, anybody who's in the UK, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5345.96s)]
*  you can no longer, we're gonna look at your IP addresses, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5349.36s)]
*  we're gonna look at your address. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5351.48s)]
*  You can't buy Figma, you can't buy Adobe, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5352.44s)]
*  we're going through with this. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5354.5199999999995s)]
*  So if you don't want consumers to have this product, [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5355.4s)]
*  you don't have to have it. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5357.8s)]
*  And then people have to get a VPN to use these products. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5358.8s)]
*  Like I would call their bluff on it. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5361.2s)]
*  It's kind of overreaching, I agree. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5363.5199999999995s)]
*  Okay, Freeberg, any last thoughts as we wrap up here? [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5365.16s)]
*  J Cal, in order to have a healthy start up ecosystem, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5368.84s)]
*  we need exits. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5371.04s)]
*  That's the bottom line. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5372.0s)]
*  That's the big picture, yes. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5372.84s)]
*  When you put this kind of chilling effect on M&A, [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5374.5599999999995s)]
*  because think about it, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5377.36s)]
*  if you're either an acquirer or you're a target, [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5378.36s)]
*  you're thinking about doing a deal, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5380.84s)]
*  and you know that it will take you at least, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5382.32s)]
*  or it could take you 15 months to get to a decision. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5385.2s)]
*  It's not worth it, you chilled it. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5388.08s)]
*  And the standard for whether it gets approved [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5389.36s)]
*  is completely arbitrary. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5391.16s)]
*  That's gonna have a dampening or chilling effect [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5393.04s)]
*  on M&A activity, [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5396.08s)]
*  which means fewer good exits for the ecosystem, [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5396.92s)]
*  which means that less risk capital [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5398.64s)]
*  will wanna go into the ecosystem to begin with. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5400.64s)]
*  And a fair thing, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5403.5199999999995s)]
*  I'll run this up the flagpole and see what you think, Sax. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5404.36s)]
*  Why don't they say if they're really concerned [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5406.5599999999995s)]
*  about the top 10 companies, [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5408.08s)]
*  hey, the top 10 companies, the trillion dollar crowd, right? [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5409.68s)]
*  The Microsoft, the Google, et cetera, Apple, [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5412.24s)]
*  they have a different standard than the mid market. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5415.68s)]
*  So if you really were concerned about consolidation [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5418.04s)]
*  in the top 10 companies, [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5420.44s)]
*  just say they're not allowed to buy these companies [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5422.04s)]
*  without going through the scrutiny, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5424.96s)]
*  but anybody under $250 billion, they can merge, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5426.16s)]
*  they can buy each other, they can do whatever they want. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5429.84s)]
*  They're exempt from this kind of review [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5431.96s)]
*  and just let the free market decide [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5434.44s)]
*  because then that would build up the mid market, right, Sax? [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5435.88s)]
*  I'm concerned about the power of big tech companies, okay? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5437.92s)]
*  But I would deal with that [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5441.44s)]
*  by targeting anti-competitive tactics. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5443.24s)]
*  Interoperability. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5445.76s)]
*  Yeah, require interoperability. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5447.04s)]
*  Don't let them bundle, things like that. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5448.72s)]
*  Don't invent some wholly new arbitrary subjective test [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5450.92s)]
*  for whether a company can be acquired. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5455.56s)]
*  We have a good standard around that, [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5457.08s)]
*  which has to do with market share. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5459.24s)]
*  Hey, shout out Lena Kahn, come on the pod anytime. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5460.88s)]
*  All right, everybody, this has been, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5463.08s)]
*  and sincerely, Lena Kahn, come on the pod, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5465.92s)]

*  This has been another amazing episode [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeKUcpU5-Xk&t=5468.68s)]
