# ICE Raids, LA Riots, Strong Economic Data, Politicized Fed, Iran War with Tucker Carlson
**All In Podcast:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis)
*  Can I ask a question about the nicotine pouches? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=0.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3.04s)]
*  Does it melt in your mouth or do you have to spit it out later? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3.92s)]
*  You can spit it out, you can swallow it or you just savor it. I mean, you throw it in [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=7.04s)]
*  like you would a dip of tobacco. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=11.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=13.6s)]
*  But you just let it sit there and then it suffuses your nervous system with life-giving nicotine. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=13.84s)]
*  And it really does feel like the hand of God is massaging you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=19.2s)]
*  But does it feel like the high of smoking a cigarette? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=23.52s)]
*  Simultaneously, if you can imagine the Zen paradox, higher alertness accompanied by [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=26.959999999999997s)]
*  deep relaxation. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=34.56s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=36.56s)]
*  You really are. No, no, it's a Zen experience. You're like cat-like in your readiness, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=37.04s)]
*  but you're fully relaxed. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=43.92s)]
*  How long does it last? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=46.0s)]
*  I always have one going sometimes. If things are, you know, if I need it, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=47.44s)]
*  I'll put another one in. So I've got 18 milligrams of nicotine. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=51.28s)]
*  But that gives me an unfair advantage. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=54.88s)]
*  You're banging 18 milligrams? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=56.96s)]
*  I don't like to because everybody else kind of recedes into the background and I become this [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  kind of colossus when I do that and I feel guilty about it. Hubris is inevitable at that point. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=65.12s)]
*  So I usually keep it to one. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=70.08s)]
*  I mean, I could use a new addiction. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  What's the gateway drug level? What would you prescribe? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=74.72s)]
*  This sits between caffeine and cocaine. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=77.6s)]
*  We sell a three milligram, but there's a transition like all great addictions. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=78.88s)]
*  You do vomit at first, but then your body acclimates. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=87.6s)]
*  It's kind of like heroin in that way, you know, like what you get or Zempik. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  You got to power through ayahuasca, you heat twice, and then you're addicted. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=96.72s)]
*  And then enlightenment. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=101.91999999999999s)]
*  And David. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=108.88s)]
*  All right, everybody. Welcome back to the number one podcast in the world after Tucker [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  Carlson's amazing podcast. That's right. Tucker is back here on the all in podcast with [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=125.28s)]
*  Chamath Palya Hapitiya, your chairman dictator and the czar, David Sachs, not from the White House, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=131.44s)]
*  he's from the suite, but he's here back on the program looking great. Look at the collar. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=138.72s)]
*  Brioni. I ordered three or four Brioni's after last week's show. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=143.68s)]
*  I did. I'm getting the Brioni. Well, I have the all in expense accounts now. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=147.84s)]
*  Would you call it Brioni? Brioni? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=150.96s)]
*  He'll be paying for it over 72 months. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=152.8s)]
*  The layaway. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=157.76s)]
*  Use a firm or Klarna. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=158.8s)]
*  I'm going to wait for that. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  Hey, Tucker, last time you were here, you famously, famously, gosh, it's been a year of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  feedback on your last performance. Thank you for coming back. We got a lot of crazy feedback from [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=169.68s)]
*  the private equity housewives, but I got more feedback. They love me. But you know what? You're [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=174.24s)]
*  in, you're in deep, you're in deep because I am here in LA and the Los Angeles studio wives group [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  is really, really pissed off at you because they feel that they're the problem. They feel [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=188.32s)]
*  they're a much bigger problem than private equity housewives. So how are you studio heads wives [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=192.64s)]
*  versus private equity wives? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=197.28s)]
*  I know some of them and they're absolutely a bigger problem, but they're fewer of them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  Got it. It's kind of hard to get critical mass. Yeah, exactly. They're, they're a smaller threat. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  They're kind of an elite unit. You know what I mean? They're like Delta Force. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  They have less money too. You know, they don't get as much in the divorce as these private equity [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=213.28s)]
*  wives. Got it. So they, they're coming in like a SWAT team. If you want to send them in to deal [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=217.04s)]
*  with a very specific issue, great, but they're not going to cause as much bedlam globally as the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  private equity. They cause a lot of misery though. As one Mackenzie Bezos. Exactly. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=230.56s)]
*  All right, listen, let's get a plug in here. All in summit fourth year. Tucker's coming this year, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=237.44s)]
*  I hope. September 7th and 9th in Los Angeles. The goal have the world's most important [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=242.72s)]
*  conversations, yada, yada, yada, blah, blah, blah. Apply for a ticket. All in.com slash yada, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=247.44s)]
*  yada, yada or all in.com slash summit to apply for a ticket. Freeberg is out this week. So [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=254.24s)]
*  Tucker is here and my Lord, what going on in the news? Let's start with [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=259.92s)]
*  it. The immigration protests slash riots slash ICE actions in Los Angeles. I'm actually here [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=264.24s)]
*  last Friday. Protests broke out after ICE raided Home Depot, a fashion wholesaler. In total 44 [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=273.04s)]
*  people were arrested by ICE. 10 times as many, 400 and counting from the protests. They even ran into [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=280.72s)]
*  a strawberry field in Oxnard to just randomly pick people up, it seems. At least a half dozen [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=288.79999999999995s)]
*  Waymo's were vandalized and burned. 20 plus businesses looted and Waymo narrowed their area [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=296.0s)]
*  and it's spiked with 30 minute wait times. So that's a first world problem. Riders throwing bricks, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=302.88s)]
*  Molotov cocktails, shooting fireworks at law enforcement, completely unacceptable. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  Two men were charged with throwing Molotov cocktails at officers. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=313.12s)]
*  Trump deployed the National Guard 2001st and 4000 apparently. And apparently there's a battalion [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=317.84s)]
*  of Marines here 700 of them. Karen Bass instituted a curfew downtown LA, 8pm to 6am. And prosecutors, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=324.88s)]
*  federal prosecutors that is, are trying to identify hundreds of people. Newsom, Bass denounced the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=333.28s)]
*  raids obviously, and they're blaming Trump for escalating the situation. Trump and members of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=339.84s)]
*  the White House responded by calling out California's weak leadership. And now we have [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=345.04s)]
*  protests popping up everywhere else, New York, Chicago, Austin, DC. Tucker, you grew up in [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=349.52000000000004s)]
*  Southern California, I think. I did. Yeah. LA and La Jolla. I mean, are these riots more or less than [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=354.08000000000004s)]
*  Lakers championship? How concerning are they to you? Who's to blame? Well, as measured by violence, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  they're less profound than what happened in 2020 after George Floyd died. They're way less dangerous [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=369.36s)]
*  than say the Watts riot or the Rodney King riots in LA, but they're much more profound. I mean, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=375.76s)]
*  there's certainly a bigger deal than anything that happened in Fort Sumter, for sure, which kicked [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=385.04s)]
*  off the bloodiest war in American history. The federal government has as a core duty, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=388.72s)]
*  the right and responsibility to enforce immigration law and police the borders. That's what the [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=394.0s)]
*  government is. That's what the federal government is, really. And so if you can test that, it is [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=398.96s)]
*  like a threat to disunion fundamentally. I mean, I think there's a lot at stake. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=405.12s)]
*  And we reached this point because a series of paradoxically weak federal governments allowed [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=408.56s)]
*  sanctuary cities to continue literally for decades, each one its own form of insurrection [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=415.35999999999996s)]
*  against the central government. And maybe you don't believe that the federal government has a right [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  to pass laws restricting immigration. It's not in charge of the integrity of the borders. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=424.96000000000004s)]
*  That's a kind of philosophical or constitutional case I guess you could make. But most people accept [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=430.56s)]
*  that those are federal duties. And once you accept that, you can't allow states or municipalities to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=434.64s)]
*  flout the law any more than you could allow Central High School in Little Rock to keep black students [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=439.76s)]
*  out or whatever. I mean, certainly, federal troops have been called in for much less. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=444.08s)]
*  And I think the longer this continues, the greater the threat of disunion, the greater the threat of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  reaching a point where you can't drive from New York to LA. We take a lot for granted in the country [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=455.44s)]
*  and the main thing we take for granted, I think, is freedom of movement between states. But you [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=461.2s)]
*  could easily imagine that ending like soon in the same way that you can't drive from, not because [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=465.59999999999997s)]
*  I've tried, from São Paulo to Rio and Brazil, pretty first world country, it's too dangerous to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=470.71999999999997s)]
*  do that. You could easily see that happening here. So I think once the Trump administration commits [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=475.84s)]
*  to putting down the riots, to enforcing federal law by force, it kind of can't back away from that. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=482.56s)]
*  Like, you know, and that raises the question of who's funding these, etc, etc. And I think [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=488.08s)]
*  it's a really interesting question we should find out. I don't think the only arrest should [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=492.64s)]
*  be on the scene. I do think the drug cartels are involved flexing their authority in California. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  They have a lot of control in California, as I'm sure you know, etc, etc. But the bottom [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=501.84s)]
*  line question is, does the federal government have a right to enforce federal immigration law? Yes. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=505.68s)]
*  And if states are out of compliance with that, it doesn't have any option but to force the issue. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=510.88s)]
*  Soterios Johnson D.D.S. D.D. Tramatha, when you see this amount of [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=516.16s)]
*  paramilitary military, literal military coming in, the dragging of, you know, handymen from Home Depot, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=521.28s)]
*  as opposed to the strategic way this started, which was, hey, we're going to go after the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=529.2s)]
*  felons, we're going after the gang members, the really bad folks. And then this time, now it seems [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=533.28s)]
*  like, hey, we're just going to roll up to a farm, we're going to roll up to a Home Depot, just grab [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=537.6s)]
*  everybody, we'll figure it out later. If they're, you know, papers check out or not. Are you in [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=543.36s)]
*  favor of the, hey, all 20 million got to go? I'll call that the Steve Bannon position. Or are you [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=549.12s)]
*  into in the 5% of illegal aliens who are criminals, they need to go, but maybe a path to citizenship [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=554.48s)]
*  for the other 19 million? I think the president was asked a version of that question today, Jason, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=561.76s)]
*  and I think what he said is there are people that have worked, for example, on farms for 20 to 25 [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=567.36s)]
*  years, or they work in the leisure industry. And he said, we have to take a common sense approach [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=573.04s)]
*  to those people. Because if you do take those people, then it's creating a vacuum where these [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=578.72s)]
*  jobs could get filled by folks that are essentially criminals or other things. So I believe that that's [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=584.64s)]
*  a reasonable starting point. What I would say is, where do we go? There are seven and a half [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=590.4s)]
*  legal, not illegal, legal immigrants in the United States, waiting for their adjustment of status. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=599.6s)]
*  Those are doctors, those are lawyers, those are scientists, those are family members of existing [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=609.76s)]
*  American citizens. There's an entire body of people that I think we have to recognize that [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=618.0s)]
*  have been waiting in line. And their first act in America was a legal action to come in and contribute. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=623.6s)]
*  And every time we start this conversation, we go to the plight of people whose fundamental first [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=632.08s)]
*  action was an illegal action without understanding that there has to be actually a more balanced [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=638.08s)]
*  approach. So yes, I think the president is right. Common sense for the folks that have now been here [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=643.92s)]
*  for a very long time. But we have to prioritize the people that started by saying, we're going to wait [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=649.52s)]
*  in line properly. And then there's people in the middle. But I think that there needs to be a way [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=654.64s)]
*  to give those folks a chance to get their affairs in order. But they should be playing by the rules. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=659.4399999999999s)]
*  Got it. And I think it's unfair to reward not playing by the rules. Okay, so some middle ground [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=665.36s)]
*  between the extreme, all 20 million got to go. And the- [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=670.56s)]
*  One example that I saw online, Jason, was give folks a stipend and a year. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=673.76s)]
*  Yes, the stipend has been out there for a while, right? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=681.52s)]
*  To get their affairs in order. And then- [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=683.76s)]
*  Kaisen said that, right? Kaisen- [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=685.92s)]
*  Kaisen said that, exactly. And I think Kaisen's clip is actually the most [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=687.1999999999999s)]
*  rational for the middle chunk. But I would really focus on these legal folks and say, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=692.4s)]
*  what are we doing about those folks whose first action was to raise their hand, stand in line, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=697.92s)]
*  and say, I want to contribute by the rules that America sets out. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=704.3199999999999s)]
*  So reward them, and then punish the illegal folks coming in. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=707.12s)]
*  Adjudicate everybody else. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=711.4399999999999s)]
*  Or adjudicate everybody else. Love it. Okay, Saxon, we're going to play two clips [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=712.9599999999999s)]
*  here to level this up. And we can kind of look at this in a multi-decade way. Here's Reagan [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=715.5999999999999s)]
*  on immigration, and then followed by Clinton. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=720.0s)]
*  It is bold men and women yearning for freedom and opportunity who leave their homelands [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=722.48s)]
*  and come to a new country to start their lives over. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=728.08s)]
*  They believe in the American dream, and over and over they make it come true for themselves, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=731.68s)]
*  for their children, and for others. But their greatest contribution is more than economic, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=736.48s)]
*  because they understand in a special way how glorious it is to be an American. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=741.52s)]
*  They renew our pride and gratitude in the United States of America. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=747.28s)]
*  The greatest, freest nation in the world, the last best hope of men on earth. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  All Americans, not only in the states most heavily affected, but in every place in this [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=758.0s)]
*  country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=762.0799999999999s)]
*  That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=768.64s)]
*  by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=772.8s)]
*  ever before. We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=777.68s)]
*  and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=784.0799999999999s)]
*  immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=788.8s)]
*  Okay, Sax, my question for you is, on a party basis, this seems to have flipped. We talked [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=794.64s)]
*  about this before on the program. Republicans wanted immigration, NAFTA, legal, even maybe an [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=800.96s)]
*  open border where workers could go freely back and forth from Mexico, kind of like the EU. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=808.1600000000001s)]
*  Clinton wanted to deport folks so that Americans could have more jobs and that wages would go up. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=813.6800000000001s)]
*  Now it seems to have flipped. Obviously, you're inside the administration, disclaimer, disclaimer, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=820.64s)]
*  whatever you want to disclaim this. What's in the best interest of all Americans going forward? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=824.8000000000001s)]
*  We have an interesting wrinkle here, which I'm sure you've been thinking about as the AI czar, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=830.72s)]
*  which is jobs are going away in a lot of key areas where robotics and AI are coming in. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=836.0s)]
*  You have to contend with what the American people want and AI and job destruction or [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  displacement that can be caused by it. What are your thoughts generally? Obviously, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=851.04s)]
*  you work in the administration, so I want to give you that chance to explain personal versus [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=855.12s)]
*  administration position. Well, my reaction is that you're doing everything possible to avoid the [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=859.68s)]
*  fact that LA is on fire right now and law enforcement is being assaulted by rioters who [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=865.36s)]
*  look like an invading army. They're rioting under a foreign flag. Yeah, you're showing clips of [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=870.88s)]
*  Reagan and Clinton. What the hell does this have to do with the fact that there are riots in LA [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=875.44s)]
*  right now? Oh, I was trying to level up- This is the issue at hand. Oh, I was trying to level up [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=880.48s)]
*  the conversation to talk about the big picture of immigration, but if we want to get down to law- [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=885.44s)]
*  You're changing the conversation. I think- [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=888.08s)]
*  No, no. I'm trying to expand it, but hold on, hold on. If you're going to accuse me personally [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=890.0s)]
*  of having a scale here, I'm happy to discuss law enforcement, January 6th or this one. I believe [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=894.16s)]
*  you should not beat up cops. I come from a family of cops. You know that. We've been friends for [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=900.56s)]
*  over 20 years. My family is cop. My family is firefighter. We don't approve of throwing [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=905.04s)]
*  moral tough cocktails at cops, period, full stop. I am insulted if you even insinuate that. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=911.52s)]
*  I didn't insinuate that, but we have not discussed the issue at hand, which is- [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=917.76s)]
*  You can feel free to go micro. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=922.3199999999999s)]
*  ... the fact that LA is burning right now. By the way, if you don't want to get deported, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=923.28s)]
*  try not rioting under a foreign flag. I mean, it's just a stupid way to advocate for your position, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=930.0799999999999s)]
*  if that's what it is. But that's the topic of the week right now. I don't know why you're trying to [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=936.0s)]
*  uplevel this and talk about what Reagan thought 40 years ago. This is not relevant to what's [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=940.56s)]
*  happening in the news today. Now, you asked, what is the quote unquote American position if there is [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=946.4s)]
*  one? I can give you some polling on that. So first of all, voters approve of the ICE raids in Los [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=950.56s)]
*  Angeles by 55 to 37. That's plus 18. Voters support the administration's effort to deport [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=955.92s)]
*  illegal immigrants by 58, 37. That's plus 21. They approve of Trump deploying the National Guard by [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=961.52s)]
*  20 points, 59, 39. Only 36% say the administration's gone too far, while 55% say it's about right or [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=967.6s)]
*  too little, so plus 19. Even the liberal Quinnipiac poll found that Democrats' approval numbers [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=975.76s)]
*  at a new all-time low of minus 49, whereas Trump is now up to plus six in morning consult and plus [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=984.0s)]
*  eight in Rasmussen. So I think the American people approve of what the administration is doing here. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=993.04s)]
*  And just to fact check, one thing you said in the introduction, you mentioned this fashion wholesaler [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=999.28s)]
*  that along with Home Depot, you made it sound like these raids were just happening willy-nilly, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1004.0799999999999s)]
*  like there's some big roundup where they were just busting into places and seeing who's illegal, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1008.24s)]
*  checking people's papers. That's not what happened. This fashion wholesaler is a money-laundering [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1012.24s)]
*  operation for the Mexican cartels. This is according to Tom Homan. And many employees there [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1016.88s)]
*  are involved in very serious crimes, drug, gang, and violence, murder, child rape, and there were [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1022.08s)]
*  warrants for their arrest. So the way that this whole thing started is ICE was serving criminal [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1027.92s)]
*  warrants that state and local authorities have no right to resist. That's how this started. It wasn't [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1033.92s)]
*  random roundups. Okay. Okay. I was just, there's reporting that Stephen Miller specifically said [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1040.16s)]
*  just, he was disappointed with the number of people being roundup and deported. And he said, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1045.92s)]
*  just go to a farm, just go to Home Depot. So that's the reporting. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1052.0s)]
*  Okay. Well, I've not been able to confirm that reporting. I personally don't believe it. I think [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1057.2s)]
*  that what Tom Homan said is that they were serving criminal warrants. That's how this started. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1060.96s)]
*  Now, I think that part of the reason why the Democrats are so unpopular here is they're [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1067.28s)]
*  basically perceived as excusing the lawlessness by saying that it's only happening because the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1072.8s)]
*  Trump administration's daring to enforce the law. And so once again, they're siding with looters, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1077.44s)]
*  arsonists, and violent criminals just like in 2020. And you see- [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1082.96s)]
*  Who's siding with them? This is Democrats. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1086.72s)]
*  Okay. Because the Democrats, they said no violence. So that was many times Gavin [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1089.3600000000001s)]
*  Newsom said no violence. Karen Bass said no violence. They've been tweeting that constantly. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1094.24s)]
*  They also, okay, great. They also are saying that this is all Trump's fault that Trump started this. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1097.6000000000001s)]
*  Bass and Newsom said that the National Guard wasn't needed because LAPD had everything under [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1102.88s)]
*  control. But LAPD was at first told to stay out of the protests. And when the violence erupted, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1106.72s)]
*  and that forced them to step in, they were, according to their own chief of police, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1112.96s)]
*  Jim McDonald, quickly overwhelmed. So this is McDonald. He said, quote, we are overwhelmed. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1116.64s)]
*  Tonight, we had individuals out there shooting commercial grade fireworks at our officers [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1122.96s)]
*  that can kill you. They'll take backpacks filled with cinder blocks and hammers, break the blocks, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1126.56s)]
*  and pass the piece around to throw it at officers and cars, even at other people. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1131.28s)]
*  So according to their own chief of police, they needed the help from the National Guard. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1134.88s)]
*  So that's the real issue here is that Bass and Newsom had this policy of doing nothing and then [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1139.2800000000002s)]
*  engaging in denialism, pretending like there wasn't a problem. And then when the problem got [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1145.5200000000002s)]
*  too big to ignore, they pretend like it's Trump's fault for causing it. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1149.6000000000001s)]
*  Aaron Norris Tucker, what's your thoughts on should the Trump administration have had such a show of [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1152.96s)]
*  force? If the reports are true that they're randomly going to a Home Depot, if that is true, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1159.12s)]
*  is that the right approach right now, or is it a little too provocative and they should do this [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1165.52s)]
*  more strategically in your personal opinion? Well, considering that we have American troops [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1170.6399999999999s)]
*  in over 100 bases around the world in countries most Americans can't identify, it's a little [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1176.0s)]
*  weird to be shocked when on that rare occasion they're used to keep the second biggest city [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1181.1999999999998s)]
*  in the country from burning down. It seems like the point of having a military is to keep [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1186.08s)]
*  foreigners from burning your cities. And these are foreigners, as David said, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1192.56s)]
*  they're foreign nationals committing crimes beneath a foreign flag. So that if there was [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1196.1599999999999s)]
*  ever a time to use the US military, it's then. And as noted earlier, you can't allow the states to [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1201.1999999999998s)]
*  be flagrantly out of compliance with federal immigration law. And I have to say the core [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1206.3999999999999s)]
*  question for me as an American is really a fairness question. So the idea that people [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1210.88s)]
*  are breaking the law, but it's cool because they're doing essential services. Like, well, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1216.64s)]
*  you know, I pay a lot in taxes, maybe I pay 80% and that feels like enough to me. And hey, man, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1220.24s)]
*  do you really have a right to collect the last 20%? I mean, isn't 80% enough? Like back off. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1224.72s)]
*  I don't have the right to say that as an American citizen to an IRS agent. I went up in jail if I [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1230.0800000000002s)]
*  do that, or if I break any law, by the way. So rule of law, critically important. But we- [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1234.5600000000002s)]
*  Not only that, it's a double standard. And I live in a place where a lot of the population subsists [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1238.64s)]
*  on the food banks and where there are very few jobs. And it really is one of those places that [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1243.52s)]
*  NAFTA destroyed, whose economy NAFTA destroyed. And to see in the place where I live, immigrants [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1248.32s)]
*  get preference on housing, on jobs, which is actually true. And I know that liberals watch [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1253.68s)]
*  and be like, that's not really true. It is true, actually. And I wonder, because the real number [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1258.96s)]
*  is not 20 million, it's closer to 50 million. I think that's true. Illegals in the United States, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1263.28s)]
*  clearly they can't all be deported by ICE. But I also think if you have a system that hands out [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1269.04s)]
*  meaningful grants, in effect, cell phones, travel vouchers, housing vouchers, free education, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1276.0s)]
*  food stamps, to people who are here legally or who are here legally as refugees, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1281.84s)]
*  you are going to draw the world's poor. And I think it's fair to ask, do we want that? How [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1286.56s)]
*  do we benefit from that? And are we giving more to foreigners than we're giving to our own [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1290.64s)]
*  citizens? And the answer is yes. And like, how dare you at a certain point? Like you get a revolution [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1295.0400000000002s)]
*  if you keep doing that. That's too much. It's too offensive. Got it. So I think we all agree, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1299.3600000000001s)]
*  no violence on cops, shut the southern border, and giving a crazy amount of- [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1303.68s)]
*  Jake, do you think the National Guard should never have been brought in? You like me to ask [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1308.8000000000002s)]
*  questions, don't you? Do you think the National Guard should be brought in? Yes or no? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1312.24s)]
*  If the local police can't handle what's going on, of course, they should be brought in. Sure. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1316.56s)]
*  But Bass and Newsom are questioning that decision. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1322.0s)]
*  You asked me the question. I believe they should have been brought in for January 6th, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1325.6799999999998s)]
*  for BLM, or for the LA riots, if the local police can't contain them. 100%, I believe the National [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1329.28s)]
*  Guard should have been brought in for January 6th when they were beating cops. I believe they [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1336.08s)]
*  should be brought in now if cops are being beaten. And I believe they should have been brought in [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1339.6s)]
*  during BLM when cops were being beaten. I am pro-cop. I come from a family of cops. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1343.44s)]
*  So you agree that Newsom and Bass were out of line when they say that the National Guard [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1348.8s)]
*  should not have been brought in? Well, number one, I think they should call the National Guard if [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1354.24s)]
*  they can't control it. I'm not on the ground. But that's their criticism of Trump, is that he [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1358.96s)]
*  called in the National Guard. You agree that that was necessary? It's obviously necessary. Just look [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1362.72s)]
*  at the TV. The city's still on fire. The cops are completely overwhelmed. By the way, I find it [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1366.64s)]
*  comical that when 50... Well, you're not letting me finish the sentence. Hold on. Let me finish this [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1372.64s)]
*  one point. Then you can speak. Yeah. Thank you. I find it comical that the Massachusetts governor [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1375.8400000000001s)]
*  called up the National Guard when DeSantis sent... Remember when he sent the 50 migrants over to [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1381.6000000000001s)]
*  Martha's Vineyard? Yes. And they all freaked out. And they literally called the National Guard in [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1386.24s)]
*  because 50 migrants all of a sudden had been flown into Martha's Vineyard? Yeah, they did. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1391.2800000000002s)]
*  Okay. But you can have thousands of... Was that to process them or because there was riots? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1394.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, that was when DeSantis was making a point about... [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1399.44s)]
*  Okay. But that was to process them. They weren't rioting in Martha's Vineyard. These were just [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1401.92s)]
*  salt of the earth folks. Nonetheless, the National Guard was brought in. And you can have thousands [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1406.24s)]
*  of people, though, rioting in LA, but somehow the National Guard shouldn't be brought in. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1410.24s)]
*  We're in agreement. So you can try to force me to disagree with you, but I'm in agreement. Any time [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1414.16s)]
*  the cops are overwhelmed, I think the National Guard should be brought in. Period. Full stop. So [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1418.3200000000002s)]
*  we're in agreement on that. What I'm trying to get to is, Tucker, if you believe there's 50 million [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1421.92s)]
*  people, let's say the numbers 30 million, we split the difference between the two, 35 million, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1426.08s)]
*  whatever it is. My question for you, how many should be deported by ICE at $20,000 a person, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1430.8s)]
*  which is the estimate that both sides seem to agree is what it's going to cost. Should we [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1437.9199999999998s)]
*  deport a million? Should we deport 10 million? And then how, Tucker Carlson, would you deport them? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1442.08s)]
*  Well, I think the goal has to be full compliance with the law for everybody within our borders, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1448.3999999999999s)]
*  citizen or foreign born illegal refugee green card holder. If you're in the United States, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1455.2s)]
*  you obey our laws. And if you don't, we make a good faith effort to enforce them despite how powerful [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1461.52s)]
*  the political blocks that you're going to be. So you're all 50 million. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1468.96s)]
*  So, well, by definition or else, why wouldn't I apply that same standard to my taxes? Right? So, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1471.76s)]
*  but how do you do it? Yeah, let's get into that. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1477.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. So, well, that's a hostage situation. It's like, we've got 50 million here already. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1480.96s)]
*  We've lied about the number for 30 years now. Wow, it's 50 million or 35 million. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1484.24s)]
*  We need them. Everyone gets a path to citizenship. You know, that's a kind of crime, actually. But [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1488.8s)]
*  the first step, and the phrase has been devalued, but self-deportation, if you have a system where [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1494.32s)]
*  people come to the United States to make their own way and take advantage of the freedoms offered [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1501.92s)]
*  in the economy, they're allowed to participate in the economy, then I think you could have a system [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1506.48s)]
*  where people really admire immigrants in the way that they did when I was growing up and that I [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1511.44s)]
*  still do in some ways. I mean, so my favorite people are immigrants and they all tell the same [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1515.52s)]
*  story. Came here with nothing, built this great life, but you make everybody cynical and you [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1519.04s)]
*  sort of destroy the idea of the virtue of immigration when you hand people stuff and [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1524.96s)]
*  give them preference when they arrive. And we don't talk enough about what that actually looks like. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1530.48s)]
*  We spend a lot more than 20 grand a person right now in subsidies to people who aren't even allowed [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1536.8s)]
*  to be here. Tucker, and they also pay into social security too, right? To the tune of 100 billion [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1541.6s)]
*  years. Oh, please. Okay. No, that's just what was reported by our government. If we want to get [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1546.08s)]
*  conspiracy corner, that's not true. I think those are fake. I think those are fake numbers. Look, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1551.04s)]
*  does anybody really believe that 50 million illegals is a net benefit to the US economy? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1554.48s)]
*  Are you serious? Have you been to our cities? No, of course not. It's not. I actually have been [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1559.28s)]
*  probably a large number of them are a net benefit because they're working in jobs that [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1564.88s)]
*  Americans don't want to take and we're at 4% unemployment. So who's going to take all those [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1568.8000000000002s)]
*  jobs if they get deported, Tucker? But weren't you just saying that we're on the cusp of a labor [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1572.8000000000002s)]
*  revolution where some 20% of American jobs are going away in two years? Well, that could be. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1577.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So that's the nuance in this discussion is five years ago, we might be actually dealing with [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1582.4s)]
*  labor destruction. It's not just nuance. It's like a brick wall we're about to hit at high speed. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1586.5600000000002s)]
*  And I don't understand having accustomed an entire generation of tens of millions of immigrants to [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1590.16s)]
*  government handouts, what the social fabric is going to look like when that stops. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1595.44s)]
*  Yeah. Can I say something? Because I think Tucker's saying something really important, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1600.0s)]
*  which I agree with. What should immigration be in a highly developed nation like the United States? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1604.16s)]
*  And my perspective is you have to come and say, well, what is the goal? I think the goal should [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1611.76s)]
*  be to maintain supremacy. The United States is the most vibrant economy in the world. It's the [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1617.28s)]
*  most important military power in the world. It's the most technically advanced entity in the world. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1622.56s)]
*  If we do not focus on maintaining our supremacy, I don't think any American wants to go through [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1628.8s)]
*  the process of going from first to not first. And if you look back in history at all of the other [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1636.16s)]
*  countries that have had to go through that transition, that is where revolutions and chaos [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1643.12s)]
*  happen. So we should avoid that. So where does immigration play a role? It needs to play a role [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1649.28s)]
*  first and foremost in technical, military, and economic supremacy. The problem, as Tucker says, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1655.4399999999998s)]
*  is when you have five or six times the number of illegal immigrants as legal immigrants, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1660.9599999999998s)]
*  all of a sudden the idea of using immigration as a cream-skimming technique to reinforce [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1667.12s)]
*  the most capable people in the world to come here goes away because you can't have that [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1674.0s)]
*  conversation. We have people languishing for 10, 15, 20 years on visas. Their kids age out. They [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1678.32s)]
*  all go back to India and other places. Why? Because we can't focus on that conversation, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1686.7199999999998s)]
*  Jason, because we're focused on how do we give amnesty to folks whose initial action was breaking [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1693.36s)]
*  the law. Absolutely correct. And this is where the whole immigration conversation devolves. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1698.32s)]
*  We are missing the bigger picture. And you need to deal, one second, you need to deal with the [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1705.12s)]
*  illegal immigration thing in an extremely foundational way where you can defend the [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1711.12s)]
*  decision. You started illegally and you have to now go and conform to the law. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1716.8s)]
*  Which is where I'm trying to steer this discussion. Number one, we all agree on closing the border. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1722.88s)]
*  It seems like there's a breaking consensus here. Tucker wants to eventually deport everybody. You [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1726.64s)]
*  want to do something in the middle like Trump. Sax, I'm not sure what your personal position is, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1732.16s)]
*  or if you want to give it. Do you feel we should try to have a path to deport as many of these 20, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1735.8400000000001s)]
*  30 million as possible, or do you believe we should have a path towards citizenship for them? What's [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1740.96s)]
*  your personal belief, or do you want to knock it off? Well, I remember when you asked that question [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1746.72s)]
*  to now Vice President JD Vance at All in Summit, and he said that you basically address that problem [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1750.88s)]
*  the same way that you eat a sandwich, which is one bite at a time. So that makes sense to me. If [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1757.44s)]
*  there's 20 million illegals, you start with the top million who are violent criminals and gang [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1762.64s)]
*  members, and you deport those. And that is what ICE was doing. They were serving criminal warrants. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1768.0800000000002s)]
*  And then after you successfully do that, then you see where you're at and you can address the next [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1774.5600000000002s)]
*  bite of the sandwich. That makes sense to me. Now look, I think that we're not really addressing [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1778.48s)]
*  a really core part of the issue here, which is for a couple of decades now, conservatives [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1784.48s)]
*  were demonized, and Tucker in particular, I think you were demonized, for warning about the policies [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1791.6s)]
*  that have created the mess that everyone can see on TV right now. And that mess is we have a large, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1799.1200000000001s)]
*  unassimilated population of military age males who are basically rioting right now under a foreign [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1806.56s)]
*  flag as if they were foreign invaders. We basically have a lot of separatist movement in the United [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1812.8799999999999s)]
*  States. That's what it looks like to me. And I remember when Tucker was warning about the policies [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1818.56s)]
*  that might create this on his show for years, virtually alone, probably alone on Fox News, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1823.6s)]
*  you were called a racist, this was great replacement theory, blah, blah, blah. How can everyone [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1830.1599999999999s)]
*  not look at what's happening on TV right now and say, Tucker was right. That was really dumb. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1835.76s)]
*  And look, I say this as someone from a family, I'm one of the people that Ronald Reagan was talking [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1840.4799999999998s)]
*  about, my family and I came over here, we're immigrants, but we came over here to assimilate, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1845.52s)]
*  we believe in the melting pot. That's all good. Be careful, you might get canceled for bringing [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1849.76s)]
*  the melting pot. No, the melting pot's good. I mean, I think that was the classic American model. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1852.9599999999998s)]
*  Melting pot is totally good. You speak the language. I agree. I'm just saying you can get [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1857.36s)]
*  canceled for even invoking it. That's what you're supposed to do. Why would anybody, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1860.64s)]
*  I came here because I wanted to be American and everything that American meant. If I was bigger, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1864.72s)]
*  I would have played football. There's all these things that I would have done to assimilate more [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1869.3600000000001s)]
*  and more. I believe in the culture of the United States. That's why people should come. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1873.44s)]
*  Right. So we came here, we assimilated high skill immigrants, didn't have a lot, but had good [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1878.48s)]
*  education and willing to assimilate. That's very different than what you're seeing on TV right now. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1884.16s)]
*  And again, if the people on TV just wanted to protest immigration policy in the way that you're [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1889.44s)]
*  talking about, I mean, you're describing it in this very nice, genteel way, they would be [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1895.68s)]
*  peacefully protesting under an American flag saying, we want to be here. We're willing to [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1900.4s)]
*  contribute. I think the issue- That's not what's happening. You can see that, right? I mean, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1904.8000000000002s)]
*  they look like foreign invaders. I would say- By the way, this is like the dumbest [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1910.64s)]
*  PR that if this debate is really about immigration, this is like the dumbest way [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1914.56s)]
*  for them to present their side of the argument. Because who wants to keep in this country a large [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1920.1599999999999s)]
*  unassimilated population that is proud to march, not just march, but actually protest and riot and [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1926.1599999999999s)]
*  burn and assault under the flag of another nation? That's an intolerable situation. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1932.08s)]
*  I would say dollars to donors that the majority of the people who are doing the looting and rioting [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1935.52s)]
*  are not actually immigrants because they have the ability to be deported. The people who are [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1940.64s)]
*  doing that are the bad actors that we saw during BLM, the bad actors that we saw in LA when the [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1944.96s)]
*  Lakers went. I've lived here for a decade and I am here right now. I can tell you it's contained. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1950.64s)]
*  80, 90% of those people are not the immigrants. The immigrants are hiding right now for fear [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1956.72s)]
*  of being deported. But let's sort of talk about the path. Well, where do you guys want to go with it [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1960.4s)]
*  here? I mean, I can give you my opinion if you want. Well, Tucker, I mean, I don't know, I mean, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1968.16s)]
*  I want to speak for you. If you want some balance there. But I mean, I do think that like Tucker [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1972.24s)]
*  should feel vindicated on this issue for speaking about it for so many years. Tucker, you feel [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1975.44s)]
*  vindicated? I mean, I never doubted it. I grew up, I was born in California in 1969 and my family [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1979.0400000000002s)]
*  got there in 1850. I have some sense of what the state was like, certainly through my childhood. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1986.96s)]
*  It was idyllic and it's not. The rich areas are great. Bel Air is great. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1992.16s)]
*  La Jolla is still great, I think. I mean, Mount Shasta is great. Lots of great places in California. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=1998.72s)]
*  But fundamentally, the state is Islam. It's a Latin American country and immigration did that. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2004.72s)]
*  And I say that as someone who is pretty pro-immigrant, actually. My best friend's [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2009.52s)]
*  an immigrant. I mean, I've always admired immigrants. I'm hardly anti-immigrant or [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2012.64s)]
*  anti-immigration, but the way we did it destroyed the state. Immigration is what made California [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2017.52s)]
*  into Islam. And there's kind of no way around that. And so that's not an argument against [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2022.0s)]
*  all immigration. I'm not making that argument. I don't feel that way. But it's an argument against [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2026.16s)]
*  what we did in California. And rather than learn from that, we're doing it in every other state. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2031.36s)]
*  And I don't know why. And I think, you know, if the other side had a reasonable argument, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2036.72s)]
*  they would proffer it. But instead, they call you names and try to turn you into some kind of [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2041.6s)]
*  thought criminal or whatever. I don't care, obviously. But it's a sort of measure of how [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2046.16s)]
*  little they have to say in response. They're not actually trying to make the country better. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2053.6800000000003s)]
*  That's kind of the main thing. I have always thought immigrants are great because they did [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2057.04s)]
*  it make the country better. Right? I mean, I think that's demonstrable. But the people pushing our [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2060.56s)]
*  current policies don't have that as a goal. This is a kind of punishment for something. And a lot [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2065.6800000000003s)]
*  of it's ethnic, actually. It's a kind of attack on the people who were born here. I don't know [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2071.28s)]
*  where that hostility comes from. You can feel it, though. And I think it's foolish to deny it. That [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2076.1600000000003s)]
*  is a motive. They're trying to hurt the people who live here. And again, I live in a place currently [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2081.84s)]
*  where I see that happening. And it drives me totally bonkers. And the last thing I'll say is, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2086.32s)]
*  if you think the way we once did immigration was good, and a lot of immigrants are awesome people, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2091.1200000000003s)]
*  and I do think that this is discrediting all immigration. And it's turning people into [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2097.12s)]
*  pretty radical immigration restrictionists. They're like, look, I don't want any more immigrants. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2103.8399999999997s)]
*  That's inevitable. But it's sad to see it. By the way, what you're saying is, is the most true for [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2109.2s)]
*  immigrants, legal immigrants look at illegal immigration even more negatively than native [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2117.04s)]
*  born Americans? Which makes sense, right? I mean, they waited in line and other people didn't. You [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2122.8s)]
*  would be really upset if somebody cut the line. Jason, what do you think? Obviously, there's a lot [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2127.44s)]
*  of emotion around this issue. I think numbers help. And I always look to see what is the consensus [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2131.6000000000004s)]
*  amongst the group here and amongst Americans. Everybody wants the border closed. Trump won on [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2136.48s)]
*  that. So, okay, we all agree the border should be closed. I think 80, 90% consensus in that. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2142.7200000000003s)]
*  80, 90% of Americans think we should deport violent criminals. Okay, we've got consensus there. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2148.0800000000004s)]
*  So then what's left is what do we do with high skilled recruiting? I like to use the word [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2152.4s)]
*  recruiting. And we had that discussion with President Trump here. He promised to put a green [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2157.76s)]
*  card on every degree. I agree with him on that. I think we should be recruiting at least a million [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2161.36s)]
*  or 2 million amazing people per year. One to 2 million amazing people. We should match that [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2167.84s)]
*  to what the needs of the country are. If we need energy, if we need doctors, we should match that. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2173.28s)]
*  Where we probably disagree is, I think, the Democrats and the Republicans share equally [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2178.08s)]
*  in this issue that was created that Tucker pointed out. Yes, there are 40, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2184.24s)]
*  30, 50. Who knows what the exact number is. That's part of the problem. Here's a chart we made. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2187.92s)]
*  This just shows you under each of the last 50, almost 50 years of presidents, how many people [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2192.64s)]
*  immigrated to the country. And as you can see, it's been pretty consistent. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2202.48s)]
*  You know, around 3 million per and Clinton and Bush had a ton of immigration. Both Bush's [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2206.4s)]
*  were paid for. A lot of their donations came from corporates who wanted free migration. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2214.2400000000002s)]
*  There's no creative. Hold on. Let me finish my thought. There's an outlier here, Jason, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2219.76s)]
*  though. Oh, well, yeah. Biden is the huge outlier. We all agree on that. Biden let it go YOLO. And I [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2223.6800000000003s)]
*  understand people have a lot of resentment for that and rightfully so. And if you bring in 10 [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2229.2000000000003s)]
*  million people, you're going to get a lot of bad guys. But you put this all together. My belief [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2233.68s)]
*  is that this is a country of immigrants and that this country does great when hardworking immigrants [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2238.7999999999997s)]
*  assimilate. I think we should take this raw firepower of these incredible immigrants who [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2244.0s)]
*  have been here for decades. If you've been here for 10 or 20 decades, pay a fine, pay some extra [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2248.56s)]
*  taxes, and we give these people a path to citizenship and we recruit the top one to 2 million [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2253.8399999999997s)]
*  people. That's my belief. You do that before or after the people that have been waiting in line [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2260.8s)]
*  get a fishing? I think I would start before or after. I think you have to do it before [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2264.88s)]
*  because we created this. And I know that that's not something that people want to take ownership of, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2270.32s)]
*  but America created the situation. Bush created it. Reagan created it. Clinton, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2275.44s)]
*  America. Yes. The country that we live in, our government allowed millions of people here [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2280.0800000000004s)]
*  and the Republicans did this specifically in order to get cheap labor. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2284.8s)]
*  So we are responsible for what we did with these people. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2290.08s)]
*  Let's just say that you're an international mathematics Olympiad winner. You get recruited [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2293.04s)]
*  to come to the United States on a student visa. You crush it. Let's say you go to MIT and then [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2301.04s)]
*  you go and do a PhD at Caltech and then you get recruited on an OPT visa by Google and you're just [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2306.48s)]
*  crushing it. Awesome. And you're saying that that person- [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2313.52s)]
*  Oh, no, sorry. That's a more subtle question. That person we should recruit, as I said very [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2317.7599999999998s)]
*  clearly, recruit the top one to two million. They are currently waiting in line, Jason. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2321.3599999999997s)]
*  Yes. So let's just say- [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2325.68s)]
*  So I'm saying yes, let them in. And yes, a path to- [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2327.2s)]
*  Who do you prioritize? You have one- [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2330.16s)]
*  You can do both at the same time. No, no, you don't. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2332.08s)]
*  No, you can't. Of course you can. We could have one group recruiting a million to two million [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2333.68s)]
*  highly skilled individuals of the type you're describing while having another group. We can do [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2338.64s)]
*  two things at the same time, Chamath. Absolutely you can. You're giving a false question here. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2345.76s)]
*  Then we take the person who's been here for 20 years as a dishwasher, as a nanny, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2350.32s)]
*  who has been an amazing citizen, who has been paying into Social Security, give them a path, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2354.6400000000003s)]
*  a compassionate path. And we as America and Americans should take ownership of the fact that [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2358.7200000000003s)]
*  we allowed this and the people who allowed it were Republicans and Democrats. We allowed these [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2364.0s)]
*  people to come in to work in our restaurants and fields, which is what Trump said today. Trump is [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2369.0400000000004s)]
*  in agreement with me. That's not what he said. He said something different. He said he wants [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2374.16s)]
*  to not have those people leave. It's just amazing to me that on this podcast during the Biden years, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2378.72s)]
*  you were echoing this party line that the videos of, you know, mass migration, caravans streaming [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2385.3599999999997s)]
*  across the border, going through the holes in the wall, you said those were videos cherry picked [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2392.0s)]
*  by Fox News. You echoed the party line that there was no problem. No, no, no, no. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2395.8399999999997s)]
*  All of a sudden, you're saying it was a bipartisan problem. No, no, fact check. I said we are, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2399.84s)]
*  we don't know because we don't have the metrics and we don't have a good system, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2405.28s)]
*  which we all agree on. There's no good system. Anybody who went down to the border was saying [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2408.7200000000003s)]
*  that it was wide open. Right. And as we got that data, I said this data on the ground [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2412.32s)]
*  shows we should shut the border. That's always been my position. You suddenly became very empirical [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2417.5200000000004s)]
*  about the issue. I've always been empirical about it. And I've also been compassionate. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2421.44s)]
*  The whole like both sides are to blame thing kind of ignores the fact that you had the Trump [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2424.8s)]
*  Revolution in 2016. There is some truth to the idea that both parties neglected the problem. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2428.08s)]
*  If you go back far enough, like, you know, Tucker, remember this when Bob Bartley was the editor of [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2434.24s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal op-ed page, they actually supported a constitutional amendment in favor of [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2438.16s)]
*  open borders. I mean, they really believed in this whole idea of free trade, open borders, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2442.72s)]
*  free flow of capital and labor. Okay. But that was a long time ago. And, you know, with the rise of [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2449.52s)]
*  Trump in 2015, 2016, it became a different party. Trump got elected on building a wall. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2454.4s)]
*  And what happened? The Democrats fought him tooth and nail. They tied him up in litigation. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2461.76s)]
*  He was able to build hundreds of miles of wall, but there were uncompleted parts of it. And when [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2466.1600000000003s)]
*  Biden came into office, there were large pieces of the wall that were still on the ground just [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2470.88s)]
*  waiting to be erected. And Biden sold them off as scrap metal for two cents on the dollar. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2475.6800000000003s)]
*  Do you remember this? And the Democrats proceeded in favor of immigration and closing the border. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2480.32s)]
*  So please don't frame it as I'm against that. Okay. Just forget about you. I'm just, you said [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2486.8s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans are at blame for this. Not in the last eight years. No. Oh, yeah. No, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2490.7200000000003s)]
*  Biden. Trump's the outlier. Yeah. Biden opened up the border and Democrats supported him in that. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2496.4s)]
*  And they thwarted every Republican attempt to close the border. And they lost. Hold on a second. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2503.44s)]
*  For three years, they gaslit and pretended it wasn't a problem. Then when it became undeniable, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2508.72s)]
*  they claimed that Biden didn't have the executive authority. So they would need a new act of Congress. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2515.4399999999996s)]
*  That was also total nonsense. As Trump said in the State of the Union, you didn't need a new law. You [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2520.08s)]
*  just need a new president. Look, if you want to go back 20 or 30 years, you can blame both parties. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2524.64s)]
*  If you want to talk about the last eight years, there's only one party to blame. One party. The [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2529.8399999999997s)]
*  Democrats. And that is why you look at the polling right now. Democrats, their party, all time low. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2534.72s)]
*  It is, let's get the exact number, negative 49. 21% approve of Democrats, 70% disapprove. Because [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2541.12s)]
*  they know that Democrats caused this problem and Democrats are the ones denying. They're the ones [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2547.68s)]
*  basically making excuses for the disorder and the chaos right now. The only Democrat who's actually [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2553.7599999999998s)]
*  talking sense right now is the one with a head injury. Ironically, Fetterman is a lone voice here. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2560.08s)]
*  I want to pull up this quote. No, I mean, it's kind of sad, but look, I'm agreeing with Fetterman. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2567.36s)]
*  Fetterman says, but the caveat that he hit his head. I don't know what it is about Democrats. It [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2577.7599999999998s)]
*  takes a head injury for them to talk sense. Okay. It's like a bullwar thing. Anyway, Fetterman said, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2585.84s)]
*  my party loses the moral high ground when we refuse to condemn setting cars on fire, destroying [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2593.52s)]
*  buildings and assaulting law enforcement. Yes. I apologize. I unapologetically stand for free [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2598.56s)]
*  speech, peaceful demonstrations, immigration, but this is not that this is anarchy and true chaos. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2605.1200000000003s)]
*  So kudos to Fetterman, but he's the only Democrat out there. He's a lone voice. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2610.8s)]
*  And Tucker's our guest. I'm going to give Tucker the last word on this topic before we go on to [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2615.84s)]
*  the next one. And you are a hundred percent correct. Biden, 10 million net immigrants and Trump, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2620.96s)]
*  3 million, which sounds like a lot, but it's actually the lowest in like 10 administrations, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2626.4s)]
*  the lowest since Reagan. Tucker, you're our guest. Wrap us up here. What should we think? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2630.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that we should measure the health of a country, at least in part by the condition of [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2636.7200000000003s)]
*  its cities, including the cleanliness of its cities. And by that measure, our country is [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2641.44s)]
*  collapsing. Our cities are a disaster and the richest part of the richest cities are fine. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2647.44s)]
*  And the rest of them are just absolutely awful. And so I think that has got to be just job one. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2654.16s)]
*  If you want to renew the United States, you have to make sure its population centers are clean, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2659.76s)]
*  safe, orderly, but especially clean. There's something really important. And I know that the [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2664.64s)]
*  left just instinctively discounts that, but cleanliness is next to godliness. And your city [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2669.6s)]
*  is a reflection of your self-respect, how you feel about your nation, your patriotism. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2674.72s)]
*  And if you allow it to become like Paris or New York covered in graffiti and filth and random [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2679.8399999999997s)]
*  people from other countries selling fruit on the street and begging and having sex in ATM vestibules [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2685.92s)]
*  and just like the whole Midtown Manhattan, central Paris experience, like that's a sign [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2691.7599999999998s)]
*  your civilization is going under. I think it's really, really important. And I do think, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2697.28s)]
*  you know, that decay is not entirely caused by mass immigration, but mass immigration has made [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2701.92s)]
*  it much worse. And I just know that from walking around because I like to walk around cities. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2707.0400000000004s)]
*  I think it's a national emergency and the riots are just the most florid expression of that. You [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2711.1200000000003s)]
*  know, burning car is something you can't ignore, but we do ignore the condition of Sixth Avenue [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2716.2400000000002s)]
*  at 49th Street. Like how can a self or the condition of Penn Station or, you know, [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2721.6s)]
*  of our airports, like how can we allow that? So if I were in charge, I mean, I would make, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2726.64s)]
*  you go to Dubai or Doha or Moscow or some place that has a sense of itself. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2733.92s)]
*  When we got so bad in Tokyo, remember two years ago when we were talking about this exact issue, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2738.64s)]
*  it just, well, but it's true. I mean, Tokyo is the most radicalizing experience for an American. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2742.7999999999997s)]
*  Everyone who goes there is like, I can't even deal with this. I'm so angry that we've put up [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2749.6s)]
*  with what we're putting up with. I had to talk to a pledge in Tokyo. You did. And let's not [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2753.52s)]
*  overthink it, I guess is what I'm saying. It's not even about the constitution. It's about litter. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2757.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Tucker gets the last word on that. And now David Sacks gets to take his incredible victory [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2762.64s)]
*  lap. Economic data has been objectively pretty great the last two weeks. Tariff revenue spiked [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2767.44s)]
*  23 billion in May to X from February. So there we go. We see the impact of a little bit of extra [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2774.64s)]
*  income. Inflation continues to come down and what are we at 2.4% across the board. There's some [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2780.3199999999997s)]
*  pluses and minuses in there. We'll get into it later. GDP. Okay. This is the leading GDP prediction [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2789.6s)]
*  model from the Atlanta Fed could be as high as 3.8%. Again, this is a prediction for Q2. Q2 is [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2796.56s)]
*  obviously not over but this would be a pretty big jump over Q1. Despite all this positive data, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2801.92s)]
*  the deficit remains the sticky issue. Some of our friends might have some issue with this [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2807.6800000000003s)]
*  and been vocal about it in May. The US had 371 billion in revenue with 687 billion in spend. Not [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2814.08s)]
*  good. Big high burn rate. $316 billion deficit. We paid $90 billion in May in interest on the debt. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2821.84s)]
*  Almost up to $100 billion a month. And there's a nice Sanki chart, which we all like. We could [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2831.92s)]
*  double click on that if anybody finds something interesting in here. Here's your deficit tracker. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2837.92s)]
*  What I'll highlight here for you is those first two lines, 2020 and 2021. You got to kind of give [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2842.2400000000002s)]
*  a mulligan there for the COVID years. And purple 2025, we are a bit ahead of the last couple of [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2847.04s)]
*  years. We're spending now, and obviously the debt service is a big part of this, 13% above [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2855.28s)]
*  2024, 20% above 2023, and 65% above 2022. The balance sheet of the United States is really bad [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2861.28s)]
*  right now. Sax, I'm going to start with you. This obviously has been an emotional issue and, oh, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2871.76s)]
*  apology Chamath. I just noticed, I forgot to hit publish on last week's episode, but let's let that [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2877.84s)]
*  go. It won't happen again. Sax, what are your thoughts here? Well, I mean, you'll recall that [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2883.2000000000003s)]
*  back in early April, Jim Cramer predicted we'd see a black Monday in response to Trump's tariffs. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2890.4s)]
*  And that's all the proofs that we should have known that we were about to get a bunch of good [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2896.56s)]
*  economic news. You were with Hershey's Cramer? And it wasn't just Jim Cramer. I mean, Larry Summers [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2900.2400000000002s)]
*  was on our pod with that big debate that we did, and he was predicting doom. And what we're seeing [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2904.88s)]
*  now is good economic news is breaking out all over. So Q2 GDP on track for 3.8%, according to [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2909.92s)]
*  the Atlanta Fed. The May jobs report was above expected, plus 139,000. CPI, inflation down to 2.4%. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2915.92s)]
*  So growth is back, inflation is low. And what you saw over the last few months was [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2924.0s)]
*  the elites in both parties, I'll give you that, they were scaremongering on tariffs and predicting [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2930.32s)]
*  doom. And they've been proven to be out of touch with popular sentiment and reality. I mean, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2934.88s)]
*  you don't want to spike the football too soon, but things look really good right now. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2939.76s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, in fairness, when the Trump shock and awe with the tariffs, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2942.8s)]
*  he came out pretty strongly, Zach, you will admit, and the market did tank massively for about 30 [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2947.52s)]
*  days. Tucker, what's your take on the economy today? Does debt, does it concern you? And I'm [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2954.0800000000004s)]
*  wondering what, because there seems to be a little bit of a rift inside of the Republican Party on [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2960.0s)]
*  the BBB, not build back better, but the big, beautiful bill. What's Tucker Carlson's take? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2964.8s)]
*  I'm curious on out of control spending, the deficit and this bill in relation to that. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2970.96s)]
*  Well, I mean, I have the world's most predictable views. I believe in physics. So, you know, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2978.32s)]
*  an unpayable debt tanks your country at a certain point. That was pre-existing. It's accelerated, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2983.12s)]
*  as you noted. I don't know a single person who's got any kind of plan to fix it. I think we're just [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2987.68s)]
*  going to ride it into whatever the point of oblivion is. But I would just say on tariffs, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=2993.92s)]
*  you know, you've got the reverse Kramer. David was saying that's his measure of economic forecasting. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3000.0s)]
*  For me, it's the Wall Street Journal editorial page. Whatever they're for is poison, generally [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3005.7599999999998s)]
*  speaking. And anything that drives them insane is a virtue. And I just can't imagine a policy [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3010.8799999999997s)]
*  more perfectly designed to just make them like explode than Trump's tariff announcement. And I [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3018.24s)]
*  have to say, I mean, I've been kind of pretty conventional Republican my entire life. I remember [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3025.52s)]
*  when I decided the Iraq War was a bad idea. That felt like an outlaw, you know, idea. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3030.56s)]
*  When did you get to that point? What led you to the point of breaking? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3036.08s)]
*  Well, I went to Iraq in December of 2003 to see where a friend of mine had been killed. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3040.48s)]
*  And so I was there right after the invasion. And I just immediately recognized this is not, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3046.0s)]
*  we're not a good colonial power, because we won't admit that we are. We won't admit that [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3050.96s)]
*  we have an empire, therefore we can't administer it in a rational way. Just the obvious stuff. But [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3054.72s)]
*  anyway, the point is, the last remaining kind of unexamined orthodoxy in my head was free trade. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3060.24s)]
*  And I happened to be just by chance at the White House the day of that announcement. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3065.9199999999996s)]
*  And I remember thinking, man, if this works, what a caper. I don't know if it's going to work or not. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3069.8399999999997s)]
*  What is the best case scenario in your mind of this tariff negotiation? Obviously, there [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3074.56s)]
*  have been multiple rounds of it. I'm not going to use the term taco, but it does seem like we've [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3081.68s)]
*  shifted from shock and awe to maybe like, kind of bore. It's kind of boring. And that does seem [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3087.2799999999997s)]
*  to be Trump's approach in negotiations. Big bang, and then fall back to a reasonable position. So [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3094.24s)]
*  I think we're in the reasonable position phase. What does success look like? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3100.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, God's willing, I hope, I pray that's what we're seeing on Iran right now. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3104.08s)]
*  But you're absolutely right. I mean, that's sort of the nature of negotiations, of course. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3108.8s)]
*  And there is nothing in writing with China, so far as I know. And it'll be reassuring, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3113.52s)]
*  I think, when there is. But in general, we haven't seen what Jim Cramer and Larry Summers predicted. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3118.0s)]
*  And that itself is amazing. It's amazing. And it causes you, someone like me is sort of on the [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3124.6400000000003s)]
*  sidelines of the economic debate, but watching carefully, it does make you sort of wonder, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3129.28s)]
*  what other absurd mid-century orthodoxies about economics have I internalized that just aren't [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3134.64s)]
*  true? Right? Because that was the biggest of all. Tariffs are, they caused the Great Depression, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3140.56s)]
*  we know that. And so what if you can have a kind of mixed approach with some trade barriers that [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3145.36s)]
*  are tailored to your benefit, and that sort of works in a longitudinal way? If that's true, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3152.2400000000002s)]
*  holy smokes. And it looks like it might be true. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3157.52s)]
*  Well, it's been true for the other side, right? They have been doing that in their policies. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3159.92s)]
*  If it's true for China and South Korea and Australia, why wouldn't it be true for us? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3164.48s)]
*  It seems like we're the sucker at the poker, Tim. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3169.44s)]
*  Well, I think you're right. I guess what I'm saying, I'm making a pretty pedestrian point, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3171.44s)]
*  but I can't get past it, which is this is so far from what the Republican Party stood for [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3175.2799999999997s)]
*  10 years ago, which was neoconservative foreign policy, free trade, open borders, as you noted, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3181.68s)]
*  maybe a little more than 10 years ago, but 15 years ago. This is the mirror image of it, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3189.76s)]
*  and it just blows my mind. And it's such a better version. It's such a more reality-based, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3194.88s)]
*  flexible, thoughtful version than we had before. And most Republicans in the Senate are not even [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3199.6000000000004s)]
*  aware this is happening. They are the most recalcitrant people in the world, also the [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3206.0800000000004s)]
*  dumbest. So most of them don't accept any of this, but just as an observer, I'm thrilled to see it. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3210.5600000000004s)]
*  All right, Chamath, your thoughts? [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3217.1200000000003s)]
*  Can I get, can I? [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3218.88s)]
*  Oh, yeah, sure. No, no, no. I mean, I know you like to go right after Tucker. It's very engaging. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3220.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, no, you got me thinking about these. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3225.04s)]
*  When you're on, he cannot in the group chat. He's so excited, Tucker, when you're coming on. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3228.1600000000003s)]
*  It's 48 hours of Saks being like, when does the pod come in? Is Tucker really coming? [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3232.7200000000003s)]
*  That's how I feel about David Saks. Trust me, if you had a camera at my dinner table, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3238.5600000000004s)]
*  you would hear something similar. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3243.04s)]
*  Oh, boy. Here we go. Go ahead, Saks. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3244.32s)]
*  It's great to have someone to the right of me on the podcast for once. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3246.56s)]
*  It's not an easy task. We invited Alex Jones and Steve Babb to have him respond. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3251.2s)]
*  Tucker got me thinking about these unexamined orthodoxies. And that is a good way of putting [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3258.0s)]
*  it. I mean, because I studied economics in college and I learned that the Smoot-Hawley [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3262.64s)]
*  tariff caused the Great Depression. And it's like, in hindsight, you're like, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3267.12s)]
*  how can that even be true? A tariff is basically a tax rate on foreign goods. And you're saying that [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3270.48s)]
*  increasing taxes on foreign goods all of a sudden caused the Great Depression. It doesn't [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3275.44s)]
*  make any sense when you actually like just think about it. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3279.28s)]
*  Now, what caused Great Depression? Well, I would say when thousands of banks went under and there's [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3283.1200000000003s)]
*  no FDIC and everyone just got wiped out by that, and it's a systemic risk. So like one bank failure [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3287.04s)]
*  leads to the next one. That's so obviously what caused the Great Depression is nobody had any [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3292.4s)]
*  money left. They all got wiped out when all the banks went under at the same time. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3297.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3303.04s)]
*  Well, and then how do we take something that happened in the 20s and 30s and apply it to a [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3303.52s)]
*  much more dynamic world like today? It doesn't make much sense. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3308.16s)]
*  Well, I think what happened is we had all these post-war, meaning post-World War II understandings [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3311.3599999999997s)]
*  that kind of got hardwired into the consciousness of our intellectuals. And if you think about the [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3316.3199999999997s)]
*  era right after World War II, the US was like the last great power standing. It was us and the [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3324.64s)]
*  Soviet Union, but they kind of had a different system. They were not part of the, let's say, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3329.92s)]
*  the free world. They're part of this communist block. So in terms of the quote unquote free world, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3335.2000000000003s)]
*  we were the only country that was relatively undamaged and we had this giant manufacturing base. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3340.2400000000002s)]
*  And so yeah, obviously that the fewer trade barriers existed across the world, the better [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3347.1200000000003s)]
*  it was for the United States because it was our goods and our factories that basically were able [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3351.92s)]
*  to sell all over the world. And so we proceeded to define a world order in which we just kicked down [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3356.32s)]
*  every single barrier to free trade because that's what benefited us. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3362.2400000000002s)]
*  Now, I don't know that that means that that situation always benefits us in all times, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3366.0s)]
*  in all places. I mean, the big issue we have right now is that you've got a rising China [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3371.6000000000004s)]
*  and they have become the skill producer in the world for all sorts of goods. They now have this [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3377.28s)]
*  giant industrial base that we seem to have exported to them. And again, it was, and we [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3382.32s)]
*  exported a lot of that because of this free trade ideology that got so entrenched in our thinking [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3387.6800000000003s)]
*  that we just stopped thinking about under what circumstances this might not continue to be good [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3394.56s)]
*  for us. And so we've ended up becoming dependent on them for all sorts of goods that we now realize [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3399.1200000000003s)]
*  are highly strategic. And we're trying to figure out, well, how do we onshore these things? Because [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3404.2400000000002s)]
*  it seems really dangerous now for us to be single threaded on, you know, on potentially [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3408.8s)]
*  adversarial power for rare earths or rare earth magnets and chips and pharmaceuticals and all [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3414.6400000000003s)]
*  these things. But you know, our intellectual class, this never seems to revisit any of its assumptions. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3421.92s)]
*  They just kind of have these dogmas. Chimoth building on Sachs's sort of codification of [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3427.2000000000003s)]
*  truths, heuristics, and not getting questioned how much of it is we just codify, hey, trade good, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3435.2s)]
*  you know, open borders, good, free trade, good. And how much of it is just incentives? Like, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3441.92s)]
*  I mean, rich people paying off politicians to have more free trade, independent of party seems to be [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3446.4s)]
*  what's happened over the last 10, 20 years. It just made more sense to put workers and to send [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3452.08s)]
*  jobs to the lowest cost place to increase profits for American companies, which let's face it, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3457.68s)]
*  although it may have hollowed out our manufacturing and created this weakness in the four or five areas [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3463.2799999999997s)]
*  you point out every week that we need to reinforce quite eloquently. The real issue is we did that [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3467.68s)]
*  because we wanted to make money. We wanted to have the most highly profitable companies and we did [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3473.9199999999996s)]
*  succeed, but maybe we succeeded too much and our companies benefited more than the middle class. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3478.0s)]
*  You got Josh Hawley out there saying, Hey, we should go to $15 minimum wage federally from this. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3483.52s)]
*  The wrong people won. In the early 2000s, I think that there was a war of ideas and that there was [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3489.6800000000003s)]
*  a group of people that advocated for this reckless form of free trade and this globalist view, like [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3497.92s)]
*  every country is going to meld into one mega monolith country organization that'll get governed [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3505.36s)]
*  out of New York by the United Nations and its slave organizations. And that worldview won. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3511.36s)]
*  But it was the wrong worldview. And it didn't acknowledge that we have competing philosophies, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3519.28s)]
*  competing priorities, competing ideals of what the future looks like. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3526.48s)]
*  And I think that we need to go back and reset all of those things. If you just take where we are, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3531.6000000000004s)]
*  if you can just put the Sankey diagram back up, there's a couple of things that are really [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3538.2400000000002s)]
*  worth noting that people need to fundamentally understand. I said a couple of weeks ago that [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3541.84s)]
*  I thought the GDP print was going to come in hot. I think everybody now is sort of where I am. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3547.12s)]
*  So let me give you the next thing that I think- [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3553.68s)]
*  Can I just ask you though, why is it hot? Do you have a thesis on why GDP spikes so much? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3555.8399999999997s)]
*  Or potentially did? That's obviously a forecast. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3560.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't know the puts and takes yet. And I think when we see the print, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3565.3599999999997s)]
*  I have a way of forecasting this stuff, which is a bunch of signals that [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3569.2799999999997s)]
*  my team and also many macro teams all around the world, the bond vigilantes to the hedge fund guys, [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3573.12s)]
*  they all feed it to me. And what I was noticing was that we were going to come in, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3580.3199999999997s)]
*  I said in the low threes. And I think if Atlanta Fed is right, I don't think they are, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3586.64s)]
*  but I think it's going to be in the low to mid threes. It's going to be meaningfully greater [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3592.0s)]
*  than what people are expecting. So let me just give you my next prediction. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3595.68s)]
*  My next prediction are two really important things. What this Sankey diagram looks at, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3599.52s)]
*  which is a snapshot of the balance sheet and the health of the United States in May, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3604.7999999999997s)]
*  misses, in my opinion, two very important things that have to change. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3609.6s)]
*  The first, and this is a positive for the Trump administration and the United States economy, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3616.7999999999997s)]
*  is we are run rating $300 to $400 billion above forecast in terms of our receipts, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3622.4s)]
*  meaning the revenues that we will take in. And you get to that number by looking at the last [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3632.7200000000003s)]
*  three months of tariffs and forecasting forward, assuming a reasonable balance here. So back to [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3638.56s)]
*  Tucker's point, yeah, we all thought that this was like a boogeyman, that you weren't allowed [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3644.4s)]
*  to touch it and that if you touched the stove, you were going to get burned. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3650.24s)]
*  The mathematical reality is that this is actually going to work out much better for us than we [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3654.72s)]
*  anticipated. And it's going to be somewhere in the range of $300 to $400 billion of extra revenue [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3659.68s)]
*  per year. That's a huge win. So why is that important? That then sets up this next cataclysmic [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3665.3599999999997s)]
*  thing that we're going to see over the next 60 days, which is what does Jerome Powell do? [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3673.7599999999998s)]
*  If Jerome Powell stays politicized, his incentive will be to keep interest rates where they are. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3680.24s)]
*  If Jerome Powell looks at the conditions on the ground, especially when you start to see inflation [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3690.4799999999996s)]
*  stay in the low twos and approach 2.0, the real thing that he's going to be under tremendous [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3697.68s)]
*  pressure to justify is why are you not cutting? And just to give you a sense of how important [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3704.64s)]
*  that is, if we cut by 100 basis points, that's another $300 billion. Now in that case, that's [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3710.72s)]
*  not money that we get in, but it's money we don't have to spend. So if you add these two things [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3716.72s)]
*  together, we are in the next 60 days going to have to re-forecast the American balance sheet [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3723.6s)]
*  where this is, or we're actually going to be able to positively forecast an extra $600 billion, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3730.56s)]
*  $300 billion of incremental revenue, and $300 billion of savings. Jason, if that happens, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3736.96s)]
*  watch out. What does that mean, watch out? It means that every single risk dollar is going to [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3744.6400000000003s)]
*  run to America. Every single one. Forget Japan, forget Europe. There is no place to put your money [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3750.4s)]
*  except the United States. So I think that we have to figure out how to get Jerome Powell on the side [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3758.72s)]
*  of America versus on the side of what could happen politically. Because I think that there's [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3766.08s)]
*  probably a version in his head that says, my gosh, if I do this, it helps Trump. And if I don't do [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3771.92s)]
*  it, it hurts Trump. Practically, that is true. But the reality is the conditions on the ground [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3778.16s)]
*  justify cutting. Okay. So you're predicting this $300 billion, two different ways in and out, [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3783.28s)]
*  $50 billion a month. It starts cutting this deficit pretty significantly. Your claim, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3789.44s)]
*  I just want to be clear here, is that Powell was playing politics, not working towards the dual [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3795.6000000000004s)]
*  mandate, which is very clear, controlled unemployment at the 2.0 rate and full employment. Your belief [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3802.6400000000003s)]
*  is that he's playing politics? Yes. I believe that these decisions are political. I think that [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3810.24s)]
*  the Federal Reserve has veered away from actually controlling the money supply in the best long term [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3815.04s)]
*  interests of the United States and more towards what benefits the short term. And this ties back [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3822.56s)]
*  to how I started this. What is Powell's motivation? Somewhere in the 2000s, Jason, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3828.4799999999996s)]
*  we transitioned away from having the strategic 20 year conversation about what's in the best [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3834.16s)]
*  interests of America. And instead we started to have these unipolar globalist conversations. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3839.04s)]
*  And the people that got into these centers of power, the IMF, the World Bank, the Federal Reserve, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3845.36s)]
*  the central banks around the world, they all worked towards an agenda that is now being undone. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3851.2799999999997s)]
*  I'll give you an example of where this is now being undone. Just today, the World Bank undid [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3856.0s)]
*  a rule around being able to fund nuclear energy. And you would have thought, well, hold on a second, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3862.72s)]
*  the World Bank steps in to backstop all these developing countries when they're in the middle [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3868.24s)]
*  of all this nonsense. Right? And if you think about a country that's developing, what is the [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3872.16s)]
*  single biggest input to that country? Energy. And you think for the last 40 years of multi-trillion [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3876.72s)]
*  dollar bailouts, we never demanded abundant clean energy in the developing world? Of course not, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3883.9199999999996s)]
*  because it was a political decision. Okay, Tucker, do you believe the Fed is playing politics here? [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3889.04s)]
*  It's kind of hard to believe if Powell was placed by Trump and Biden, there was consensus there, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3894.32s)]
*  and his mandate is to get to 2.0 and full employment. He's kind of trending towards that. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3899.76s)]
*  He's made a couple of cuts. The markets predict he is going to make a cut. Here's [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3903.76s)]
*  polymarket for September showing 80% chance of a cut. Let's take a look at that change since [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3907.76s)]
*  the last time. So in September, no, okay, well, this has changed. Three, two. All right. So here's [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3912.96s)]
*  your polymarket Fed decision in September. No change. 53%, 25 bips, 43, 50 bips, 3.8. So you [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3919.12s)]
*  put those two together, you're roughly at 47% chance of a cut, 53% chance of no cut. So 50, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3926.7999999999997s)]
*  50 coin toss. Do you think the Fed is playing politics? Do I think the Fed chairman who lives [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3933.8399999999997s)]
*  in Chevy Chase is a political actor? Are you serious? What's his motivation then? What's [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3939.8399999999997s)]
*  his end game? Why does he not want to cut rates or why would he not want to cut rates? Does he [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3946.96s)]
*  want to stick it to Trump or something? Well, of course. I mean, he lives in a world in which [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3951.6s)]
*  there is no one who doesn't want to stick it to Trump. I mean, I know the zip code that he [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3956.8s)]
*  lives in very, very well. I know the club that he goes to. I know the world that... No, no, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3960.16s)]
*  I would... Of course not. I'm not mad at him. I'm just saying I know the world well. And of course, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3964.64s)]
*  no one in that world wants to be seen helping Trump. And Trump has attacked him, by the way, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3971.44s)]
*  in public. So I don't think it helps either. I think the structure of the Fed governance is very [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3976.6400000000003s)]
*  weird. I think... I'm not exactly sure what the Fed is. I've asked this question to a lot of [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3983.1200000000003s)]
*  economists, including Larry Summers, never really gotten a straight answer. Like, how is it that [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3989.36s)]
*  this is beyond political control? I mean, I don't know. If we're for democracy, shouldn't voters have [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3994.6400000000003s)]
*  some say in how this is administered? But they don't. I mean, there's no direct mechanism for [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=3999.84s)]
*  voters to be heard in this, the single most important institution in the American economy. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4004.6400000000003s)]
*  How does that... Which is a crypto government organization. It's administering US dollars. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4009.52s)]
*  I just don't understand it. I think it's very... The idea that you're going to depoliticize it [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4013.6800000000003s)]
*  by making its leadership immune from the control of elected officials strikes me as the kind of [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4018.88s)]
*  mid-century dumbness that got us NATO and a lot of other bad institutions. The guys don't get it. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4024.6400000000003s)]
*  The exact opposite thing happened. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4029.76s)]
*  Exactly. Thank you. Thank you. The paradox. Exactly. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4031.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4033.52s)]
*  Sachs, what would the motivation of the Fed be here? I've asked this two times. Can't seem to get [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4034.4s)]
*  an answer. What's the motivation of the Fed? Just is it to stick it to Trump? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4039.76s)]
*  Jason, let me give you another data point. Okay. Now, let's assume... Let's just scenario play. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4043.04s)]
*  Yes, please. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4048.1600000000003s)]
*  What happens if Powell rips in 100 basis point cut right now? I'll tell you. So, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4049.44s)]
*  one part, which is mathematical, is the interest on the debt goes down. We save 300 billion. But [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4053.52s)]
*  there's something else that happens, which is the Fed does control the front end of the curve, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4059.92s)]
*  meaning how do people borrow money for small amounts of time from one day to about two years? [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4065.44s)]
*  If you make that cheaper, we know it's a test that's true as time. What happens is people [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4072.88s)]
*  borrow more money. That fuels more growth. That will end up in GDP. So, what actually happens [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4079.28s)]
*  if you cut rates 100 basis points is not just the 300, but you can get this reflexive positivity [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4086.24s)]
*  in the economy. What that allows you to do is even if that causes a little bit more inflation, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4091.52s)]
*  you're actually growing yourself out of this whole thing. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4098.4s)]
*  So, then you ask yourself, well, hold on a second. If the numerical justification is there [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4101.76s)]
*  to lower rates and it has all of these other positive externalities for the United States [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4107.36s)]
*  economy, why don't I do it? The only answer is political. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4113.28s)]
*  Yeah, let me explain, next point, pals. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4117.12s)]
*  Let me teach you. Okay, so we're at 2.6% inflation. He wants to get it down to two. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4120.96s)]
*  Feels like we're in striking distance. Maybe you could maybe give us a theory here, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4128.08s)]
*  Sachs, of what would the political motivation be? I find it hard to believe that he's [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4131.679999999999s)]
*  trying to sink Trump for some reason as opposed to maybe just being scared of inflation popping [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4135.679999999999s)]
*  up above that three X handle, which then triggers them to raise rates. Which are the right here? [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4140.56s)]
*  If you're a pal, it's better to take the risk of being Paul Volcker than Arthur Burns. I mean, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4148.080000000001s)]
*  that's basically what it comes down to. Because what happened is Arthur Burns led [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4154.160000000001s)]
*  inflation slip the leash in the 1970s and he's remembered as a horrible Fed chair. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4159.360000000001s)]
*  And then Paul Volcker came in and jacked up rates to like, I think close to 20% [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4164.0s)]
*  and caused a vicious recession in 1982. But by 1983, the economy had bounced back [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4168.88s)]
*  and inflation basically was under control. And then the rate cutting cycle started and that rate [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4176.88s)]
*  cutting cycle went for like 25 years. And then Reagan got reelected in 1984. So you'd rather be [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4182.16s)]
*  a Volcker than a Burns if you're a Fed chair. Now, you raised the question, is Powell political? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4189.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, of course he is. If you go back to, was it 2021? So the first summer of Biden's presidency, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4194.72s)]
*  we got that shock 5.1% inflation print in May of 2021, if my memory is correct. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4202.8s)]
*  What did the Biden administration do? They sent Janet Yellen out to say it was transitory. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4210.56s)]
*  And Powell got on board with the whole transitory narrative. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4215.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4218.8s)]
*  And as a result of that, he did not raise rates for six months and worse than that, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4219.2s)]
*  they continued QE. I think they bought like 180 billion of bonds in that time period. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4224.72s)]
*  And that's what allowed inflation to get so out of control. Now, why is it that Powell did that? [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4229.92s)]
*  Because he wanted to get reconfirmed. And yes, he was nominated by Trump originally, but Biden [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4235.36s)]
*  renominated him. And he basically wanted the reappointment by Biden. He wanted to get confirmed. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4242.88s)]
*  And then the month after he got confirmed, all of a sudden he shifted gears and started raising [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4247.84s)]
*  rates again, once he was safely ensconced in his office. So he did the right thing in terms of [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4253.04s)]
*  raising rates in the face of inflation, once he was free from those political incentives. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4257.92s)]
*  But for six months, he was intensely political and that cost the United States dearly. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4264.64s)]
*  Dearly. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4269.6s)]
*  Dearly. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4270.8s)]
*  So now, if you're Powell, you've got PTSD from that whole experience, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4271.52s)]
*  and you're going to err on the side of not letting inflation come back. I think with inflation down [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4276.4800000000005s)]
*  to 2.4%, I think it is time to cut rates, but he's fearful because again, his incentives are to be [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4282.32s)]
*  a Volcker, not a Burns. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4290.32s)]
*  Yeah. And I want to read a good book. Paul Volcker's keeping at it. Great book about [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4292.0s)]
*  has Reagan going to him and trying to get him to cut rates. So this is a reoccurring story. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4298.4800000000005s)]
*  If he had done the right thing in the summer of 2021, we would never would have had that bubble [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4303.76s)]
*  at the end of 2021. And that basically created a huge crash in 2022. And we could have avoided [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4307.36s)]
*  a good part of that if he had done the right thing. Like the Fed chair, it's not a hard job [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4317.04s)]
*  most of the time. These guys sit in their ivory tower and then once a quarter, they come out [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4323.04s)]
*  and do this, and basically testify and say a bunch of things that no one can understand. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4328.16s)]
*  But once in a while, you got to get the decision right. And he totally screwed it up in that one [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4334.32s)]
*  time where he had to get it right. And I would say this could be one of those moments too, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4338.8s)]
*  where I think he's being a little bit fearful. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4343.44s)]
*  I think that there's a simpler explanation, quite honestly. If you look at Powell's history, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4345.36s)]
*  he was nominated as a governor by Obama. Then Trump picked him out of the Fed to be chair, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4349.12s)]
*  but then he was reappointed by Biden. If you look at the vice chair of the Fed, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4355.52s)]
*  Phil Jefferson, he was appointed by Biden. If you look at Michelle Bowman, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4358.96s)]
*  who's the vice chair for supervision, she was appointed by Trump. Michael Barr, appointed by [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4362.56s)]
*  Biden. Lisa Cook, appointed by Biden. Adriana Kluge, appointed by Biden. Chris Waller, appointed [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4366.8s)]
*  by Trump. So I think the point is that there is a balance of power here, if you look at political [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4373.360000000001s)]
*  affiliations that tend to favor a democratic view of the political landscape. And let's be honest, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4377.52s)]
*  what benefits the Democrats more, a thriving economy and a shrinking deficit going into the [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4388.56s)]
*  midterms or the exact opposite? The reason I'm bringing this up and I'm disarping on it is he's [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4394.88s)]
*  a Republican who Democrats have opposed. So I'm just trying to reconcile this grand conspiracy [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4399.68s)]
*  that he wants to sink Trump. I don't think it's a conspiracy. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4405.280000000001s)]
*  I think it's just a general decision. I think these guys move the dot plots and you can see [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4408.16s)]
*  it in the movement. Okay? They're going away from reading the actual data and moving in concert with [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4412.719999999999s)]
*  the data to giving themselves a window to let the data play itself out beyond a reasonable point. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4420.08s)]
*  And my point is the beyond the reasonable point is the key part, because when you talk to the large, [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4426.639999999999s)]
*  sophisticated pools of money, many of them are like, what is going on here? [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4431.44s)]
*  All right. Currently the big, beautiful bill is in the Senate, passed the House by a one vote [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4436.959999999999s)]
*  margin. Trump said he wants the Senate to pass the bill by Independence Day, July 4th. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4442.4s)]
*  Senate math, Republicans have a 53 to 47 majority, as you know, they can afford three no's [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4447.599999999999s)]
*  on their side since Dems are united against the bill with 50 votes. JD Vance can break the tie, [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4453.12s)]
*  obviously. So it's easier if they can get to 51. Seven GOP senators are either no or maybe no. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4457.679999999999s)]
*  Three likely no's, Rand Paul, Ron Johnson, Rick Scott. Four maybe no's over the Medicaid cuts, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4465.4400000000005s)]
*  Josh Hawley, Susan Collins, Murkowski, Jim Justice. None of those senators have committed either way. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4472.8s)]
*  And Republicans are now falling into three camps on BBB, hard yes, soft yes, no until it's fixed. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4479.76s)]
*  Obviously, some friends of ours were a little upset about the BBB. And we had a pretty chaotic [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4486.72s)]
*  week the last week, and it looks like the reconciliation is in. Your take on the last [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4493.92s)]
*  week and the reactions to the BBB, and obviously, you want in Trump's relationship, Tucker Gough. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4498.4s)]
*  I hate the whole thing. This is not how to legislate. You shouldn't have a bill this big. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4506.4800000000005s)]
*  It's impossible to get your mind around it. No one can read it. No one understands it. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4512.64s)]
*  It favors professional staff over legislators. And it totally leaves the public out. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4517.12s)]
*  It'll be a decade before anyone understands what it means. The lobbies love it. It's Washington at [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4523.76s)]
*  its ugliest. Not this specific bill, though. It is an example of it. But this is just not the way to [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4530.88s)]
*  do it. And it's not the way it has been done throughout American history. There's no reason [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4537.599999999999s)]
*  to aggregate it all together like this. It becomes totally unmanageable and totally undemocratic. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4541.76s)]
*  So, you know, I mean, yeah, well, it's insane. It's totally insane. I mean, can you tell me [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4546.8s)]
*  what's in it? No. I mean, you know, like, all of us know, like, 11 things we've read on Twitter [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4554.64s)]
*  or whatever. But like, the truth is, even the professional staff that wrote it couldn't, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4559.52s)]
*  if you had dinner with them over three hours, really give you a comprehensive sense of what's [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4564.64s)]
*  in it. And remember, when it passes, and I think it likely will, you know, it's the law. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4569.360000000001s)]
*  And that's by design in order to make it impossible. Of course it's by design. Of course it's by design. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4575.2s)]
*  It's just, well, I mean, look, it's, you know, it's just, it's just overload. You can't, I mean, [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4580.48s)]
*  every single part of this, this is the economy of the city that I've lived in my whole life. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4586.0s)]
*  Every single part of this is there by design. It's been managed. It's been thought through. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4591.2s)]
*  It's been written artfully. And by artfully, I mean deceptively. So you can't understand its purpose [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4595.679999999999s)]
*  or its benefit. And literally, it is years before the ramifications become clear. And again, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4602.56s)]
*  this is why we have committees. You know, a committee masters a subject and then, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4608.88s)]
*  theoretically, produces legislation that bears on that subject with, you know, knowledge and depth [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4614.160000000001s)]
*  and hopefully wisdom. The Congress is not designed to pass legislation in this way. And we've evolved [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4619.200000000001s)]
*  to this. And I guess I would encourage the White House to try and blow that up. I think it'd be [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4627.44s)]
*  better for everybody if, you know, legislation was passed piecemeal, as it always has been. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4633.679999999999s)]
*  I think part of the problem is the leadership in the Congress and nobody wants to say it is [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4642.24s)]
*  just embarrassing. It's just totally embarrassing. And I would say the conference isn't united [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4647.12s)]
*  either. I mean, this is part of the problem with Trump's agenda. It's the beauty of Trump's agenda, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4651.6s)]
*  in my opinion. But it's, you know, it's so different from what your average 65-year-old [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4657.360000000001s)]
*  Republican was raised believing. It's so different from what Fox News is telling you. It's the mirror [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4662.4800000000005s)]
*  image of what the Wall Street Journal editorial page is telling you. There are just not that many [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4667.68s)]
*  members of the House or the Senate who are truly on board with Trump's message, even now. And of [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4671.6s)]
*  course, they kowtow to the man. But when it really comes down to it, they hate his stated agenda. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4677.76s)]
*  And that's why- And that's their agenda unpacked. What do they hate most? [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4686.24s)]
*  What they hate most is not even a close call. They hate his foreign policy views. They hate [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4689.76s)]
*  his foreign policy views. Because look, out of 535 members of the House and Senate, I would say 510 [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4693.68s)]
*  have given up on improving the United States through their jobs. Like they know they can't. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4701.280000000001s)]
*  It's like intractable. This is their view. It's complex. It's boring. It's difficult. And it's [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4706.0s)]
*  super hard to solve. And the numbers in the House and Senate make it practically impossible to move [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4710.88s)]
*  the ball on whatever issue they care about or were elected on. And so they take all of that energy [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4715.52s)]
*  and they apply it to making the rest of the world better. Fighting for democracy or, you know, the [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4720.88s)]
*  grander the description, the less accountability there is. You know, if we're just like fighting [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4726.64s)]
*  for Churchill against Hitler, like it's always a win because we don't know any of the details. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4732.08s)]
*  So anyway- It's a simpler- Yeah. It's a simpler cause for them to take on than looking at how do [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4736.32s)]
*  we balance this. Exactly right. And what would you like to see Trump do, Tucker? What would Tucker [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4741.76s)]
*  Carlson advise if you were in the White House, which many people have requested that you do that, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4745.12s)]
*  if you were at the right hand of the father, what would you tell him to do? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4750.8s)]
*  Understand the politician brain, which is reptilian by its nature. It responds only to pain, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4755.28s)]
*  period, only to pain. So if you want a politician to do your bidding, it's a super simple [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4761.44s)]
*  conversation. Do what I ask or I will make sure you lose your job. And by the way, Trump has the [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4767.5199999999995s)]
*  power to do that. Which is what Elon said on Twitter. Just put it out there. No, but it's true. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4772.16s)]
*  And I do think if there's, you know, a number of criticisms of any living person, but one I would [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4777.28s)]
*  level at Trump is he is, he's nice. Like he likes to get along with people. He actually doesn't like [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4782.24s)]
*  to fight in person. That is true. He likes to get along with people. No one will believe that, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4787.04s)]
*  but I've seen it a lot. And I think it's tough for him to say it's easy for him to, you know, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4791.12s)]
*  go after a reptile like Mitch McConnell, like at a press conference, he'll make fun of cocaine, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4797.84s)]
*  Mitch or whatever. But to really go to McConnell and say, yeah, listen, son, you know, this is [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4803.44s)]
*  going to hurt in the following six ways unless you obey you little bitch, which is really what he [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4810.16s)]
*  ought to be saying. No, I mean it. I absolutely mean it. And be saying that to all of these guys, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4815.36s)]
*  Tom Cotton, are you joking? How does Tom Cotton ever say in anything, you know? And oh, you know, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4820.32s)]
*  you're that chairman of the Intel committee. I'm so impressed. Listen, Tom Cotton, you represent [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4826.719999999999s)]
*  a state that likes me a lot more than you. So if I find you undermining me yet again, and Tom Cotton [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4831.759999999999s)]
*  spends an awful lot of time undermining Trump, like Tom Cotton hates Trump actually, of course. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4836.24s)]
*  But if I find you doing that, I'm going to take your Senate seat away. And that's going to be [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4840.96s)]
*  really easy for me to do. And I really wish he would do that. It would only take one cycle to [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4844.4s)]
*  clear out, you know, to really get some discipline. Like the French in Algeria, you know, for the [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4848.96s)]
*  encouragement of the others. The first guy goes out of the helicopter and then the second guy [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4853.12s)]
*  is super talkative. If you did that in the United States Senate, you would have a much more coherent [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4856.64s)]
*  party, I think. Like in about a cycle. A little more leadership, a little more stick than carrot. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4864.0s)]
*  Who wants to go next? A lot of stick. A lot more stick. Okay. Here we go. Tucker says more stick. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4869.84s)]
*  Sax, what you're feeling? Obviously- Are we still talking about the big, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4875.28s)]
*  beautiful bill? What are we talking about? Yeah. I mean, well, I mean, we're talking about it all. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4878.320000000001s)]
*  Everybody wants to hear, you know, about our takes on the kerfluffle between Yvonne and Trump, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4882.400000000001s)]
*  obviously, in relation to BBB. So let's just tackle it head on. Or you can pass on it. Yeah. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4887.92s)]
*  Let's- We got to put it out here. We're an hour into the episode. Let's just talk about it. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4892.24s)]
*  Let me speak to BBB for a second. So listen, if the question is whether I can defend a system [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4896.320000000001s)]
*  that produces $2 trillion deficits every year, no, I can't. I can't even defend the Senate rules [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4902.72s)]
*  that require you to get 60 votes for some things and 50 votes for other things. I mean, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4909.6s)]
*  it's all just seems kind of random when you're an outsider. But those are the rules is they've got [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4913.84s)]
*  these crazy bird rules. And once a year, you get to do this reconciliation bill where it only takes [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4920.16s)]
*  50 votes instead of 60 votes to pass something, which means you can actually get something done [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4925.68s)]
*  without the Democrats, which is a rare opportunity. And, you know, you just have to basically come up [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4931.92s)]
*  with a nexus to a budgetary issue. And so that's what the BBB has done. And as a result of that [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4937.76s)]
*  conduit, I guess you could say that it's a way for the president to ratify many of his most important [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4946.4800000000005s)]
*  campaign promises from the 2024 election. And so you've got the tax cut extension in here. You've [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4953.36s)]
*  got full funding of border security for four years. You've got no tax on tips. You've got drill, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4959.84s)]
*  baby drill. You've got the missile defense shield. So these are campaign promises that are important [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4964.4800000000005s)]
*  to the president. It's kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity to pass these things. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4969.360000000001s)]
*  I think that Republicans will be committing political suicide if they don't. I mean, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4974.88s)]
*  the polling on this, I'll give you some numbers. So first of all, the bill itself is popular despite [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4978.96s)]
*  all the bashing of it. I think that- Popular with who? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4984.56s)]
*  Well, this is a national poll by Signal, which actually has a bias in favor of Democrats by [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4987.6s)]
*  plus 2.1. So this is with the public? It's who haven't read it? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4994.16s)]
*  I know, believe it or not. So what does that even mean? [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=4998.08s)]
*  Is that support for a big, beautiful bill plus six, increased funding for border security plus [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5000.72s)]
*  35. That'll probably be even more now that what's going on in LA. Work requirements for Medicaid [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5005.92s)]
*  and SNAP plus 38. So despite the Democrats carping on that point, people really like the [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5011.36s)]
*  idea of work requirements. And then permanently extending the 2017 tax cuts support plus 19. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5016.639999999999s)]
*  So these are very popular planks of the president's agenda. It's the only chance they're [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5023.44s)]
*  going to have to pass this. Look, I said this three weeks ago on the pod, the last few episodes that [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5028.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't support the bill because it's perfect. I support it just pragmatically because it's better [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5034.32s)]
*  than the status quo. And my view is that we should take this now, we should get this done, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5038.24s)]
*  and then come back for more later. And there should be a big fight over the budget at some point in [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5044.16s)]
*  the future, but this is not the right time to do it. We don't have the votes. We're not organized. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5049.679999999999s)]
*  And it would compromise these other promises the president's made. And the time to really have that [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5053.2s)]
*  battle is at the beginning of the new fiscal year, which is October 1st. So we at some point do need [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5057.5199999999995s)]
*  to have a big fight over the budget. There does need to be resistance to the deficit. We can't [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5062.88s)]
*  continue in this current state forever. But I don't think that's the hill to die on right now. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5067.68s)]
*  Chamath, your thoughts on BBB and the kerfuffle, if you want to. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5072.4800000000005s)]
*  Here's what I'll say. I was sad at the end of last week. One is my friend and the other is my [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5076.0s)]
*  president. And it seemed like a really profound friendship. And so I was bummed. Here's what I'll [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5080.96s)]
*  say this week, though, on much more positive note, I saw Elon on Tuesday, and I got to spend a couple [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5087.52s)]
*  hours with him at Tesla. He let me audit a couple of meetings with him, actually. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5094.24s)]
*  It's always fun. Yeah. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5099.36s)]
*  Yeah. One was Dojo. And then right after that was the Optimus team. One thing I'll say is, [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5100.4s)]
*  I've said this before, but he attracts these incredible men and women to work for him. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5107.12s)]
*  They are inspiring. Just sitting in a meeting and hearing it, what they're doing was amazing. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5113.599999999999s)]
*  And then second, to see Elon in action at scale in that way is like watching a maestro [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5119.92s)]
*  paint a masterpiece. It's really impressive. And then separately, I saw President Trump [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5127.68s)]
*  doing a couple of pressers, and he was in his zone of excellence. So it seems like they're going to [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5133.28s)]
*  find some common ground here. They are better together. And I'll just say, Elon, amazing Tesla, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5139.4400000000005s)]
*  incredible. And I would not be sleeping on this company, is what I would say. Jason, what do you [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5148.08s)]
*  think? So we're not the main characters in this story, obviously. And when I saw what happened [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5153.599999999999s)]
*  last week, obviously, this is one of my best friends for many decades. And given the popularity [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5160.24s)]
*  of this podcast, my decision was I don't want to insert myself into this, have my quotes or my [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5166.24s)]
*  feelings about Trump about the bill get weaponized. And that's typically what happens when you have a [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5173.76s)]
*  friend who's the number one story in the world. And I'm not friends with Trump, but he is my [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5180.88s)]
*  president as well, by default. What benefit does it have to me to then speak about it and then have [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5186.0s)]
*  everybody weaponize it. So I know this is hard for the audience to reconcile. But sometimes it's [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5192.64s)]
*  better for me to just step back. That's why you don't see me commenting on Tesla or SpaceX [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5197.280000000001s)]
*  publicly all the time, because people weaponize what I say against my friend. And I just don't [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5202.16s)]
*  like that. And you know, it's happened in books, it's happens in news stories. So when Elon is [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5206.32s)]
*  doing something, and it's this intense, I like to just step back and maybe take a beat. That was my [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5211.04s)]
*  decision. That's why I didn't want to do a pod last week. Everybody else can speak for themselves. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5216.16s)]
*  That's where I'm at. How do I feel about it? I think Trump is making a mistake with BBB. I think [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5221.04s)]
*  he should push back on it harder. I said that in a previous episode. And I think he wants 100% [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5227.04s)]
*  correct about that. I also think if either of these parties can't control spending, there needs [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5232.16s)]
*  to be like the nor was it the norquist? You guys would know more about this, but norquist pledge [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5237.6s)]
*  Tucker where you agree to not increase taxes, I think we need something like that, where a reasonable [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5243.28s)]
*  party says, we should balance the budget, we have to control the deficit, there should be some pledge [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5249.5199999999995s)]
*  like that that we force our elected officials on both sides of the aisle to take. And I'm going to [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5255.44s)]
*  start pursuing that myself personally, you can go to join the responsible party.com. And I'm just [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5259.839999999999s)]
*  going to start an email newsletter and just talk about it. I think there needs to be a pledge [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5265.28s)]
*  that these politicians take to balance the budget and cut the deficit over some reasonable amount [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5268.48s)]
*  of time. But I wish them both the best. And I'm glad that the two of them have reconciled because [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5274.08s)]
*  that's good for the country. We can't have these two giants at war, the greatest innovator in our [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5278.96s)]
*  country and a president who's got, you know, an agenda, which I agree with two thirds of I may [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5284.16s)]
*  not agree with how he's doing immigration on the margins, but I agree with everything else. So I'm [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5288.32s)]
*  just rooting for the both of them, because it's so important that for America that they get along. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5293.36s)]
*  Great. So in summary, you're not selling yourself, but you have a website, www.jcal.com. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5297.84s)]
*  It accepts Apple Pay. Not telling you to go to founder.university. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5305.2s)]
*  $1 a month. But if you subscribe for a year, it's $6. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5308.8s)]
*  You actually threw in a plug. I have an issue. I'm throwing a plugin. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5313.120000000001s)]
*  That was insane. I don't care. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5315.92s)]
*  Listen, what is it? Also sign up, join the responsible party.com. I'm going to start my [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5317.92s)]
*  own Norquist pledge, but also join SAC. Insane. You're insane. I'd also like the plugs, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5323.360000000001s)]
*  Chamath's substack. It's a thousand dollars a year to get his reports. And you can of course, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5328.56s)]
*  buy David's access to kilowallin.com. I've never done plugs. Do you have? [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5333.76s)]
*  I've never plugged. No plugs from Tucker. Tucker, you cut. Wait, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5337.84s)]
*  what's in the merch store? Tucker, you got to have something in the merch store. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5341.92s)]
*  Alp, America's greatest nicotine pouch. That's all I've got. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5345.52s)]
*  Here we go. Flugs essential. Fantastic. Breaking news here. Foreign policy looks like a major [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5348.32s)]
*  escalation with Iran. Could be happening. Maybe on Wednesday it was reported some U.S. personnel [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5353.68s)]
*  were being evacuated out of the Middle East. Partial evacuation of the Iraqi embassy. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5358.64s)]
*  Oil prices move 4% on the news. Later reported that Israel is prepared to launch an operation [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5364.88s)]
*  into Iran. U.S. thinks Iran could retaliate on its bases in Iraq, which explains the evacuations. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5370.72s)]
*  Trump was asked about the evacuation, said the following, quote, they are being moved out because [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5376.64s)]
*  it could be a dangerous place. We'll see what happens. The classic Trump will see what happens. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5382.64s)]
*  And then he added, they can't have a nuclear weapon. Very simple. Okay. Polymarket odds are [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5387.92s)]
*  spiking on Israel action against Iran. 50%. Oh boy. Tucker, can the West allow Iran to have [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5394.16s)]
*  a nuclear weapon or is this more a WMD situation that we reference at the start of the program? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5406.5599999999995s)]
*  If Tucker Carlson was in the White House, which many of your fans wish you were, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5413.12s)]
*  what would your advice be here? [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5417.599999999999s)]
*  Is it up to us? Do we have the power? Nobody wants Iran to have a nuclear weapon. I don't think the [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5418.72s)]
*  Iranians want a nuclear weapon right now, judging by their actions. But could we prevent it, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5426.0s)]
*  is the question. And if so, how exactly, given that we just lost to Russia and the Houthis? [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5432.08s)]
*  I'm skeptical, but I'm amazed by how close we are to military action against Iran. It's no [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5439.04s)]
*  defense of Iran. Of course, I'm not a Shiite for the record, but I think it comes with perils that [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5446.16s)]
*  people are not considering or willfully ignoring. And the main one is Iran is not Iraq or it's not [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5450.88s)]
*  Libya. It's not isolated. It's a central player in BRICS. 90% of Iran's oil exports go to China. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5456.4s)]
*  It just signed in a defense agreement with Russia in January. So it's not, you know what I mean? It [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5464.48s)]
*  has backup. It has big allies that represent the majority of the world's population and the majority [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5469.28s)]
*  of the world's economy and landmass. So the potential for this to become something much, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5473.44s)]
*  much bigger and unmanageable is real. It's there. Their conventional weapons are fearsome and could [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5477.919999999999s)]
*  do great damage to our allies, to Israel and to American assets in that area and also to energy [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5484.5599999999995s)]
*  production in countries that we rely on. So I think the downsides are really kind of overwhelming. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5491.44s)]
*  I think a protracted, meaning anything over a day or two engagement with Iran would derail [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5498.48s)]
*  the Trump agenda and the presidency. And I think it could really sink this administration. So I [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5505.839999999999s)]
*  pray this doesn't happen. By the way, I think the timetable is distorted. There is absolutely no [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5512.4s)]
*  reason to... The president has said repeatedly, we will do everything we can to prevent Iran from [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5516.799999999999s)]
*  getting a nuclear weapon. I think it's a completely reasonable goal. Nobody wants that. I certainly [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5522.0s)]
*  don't want that. And the Israelis don't want it and the Gulf States don't want it. Nobody wants [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5525.92s)]
*  that. But it doesn't mean that it has to happen on Friday, actually. And there are other forces [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5530.0s)]
*  exerting pressure on the administration to get this done quickly, even before Steve Wittkopf, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5536.64s)]
*  God bless him, meets with his counterparts in Oman in a few days from now. So it's like, [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5543.4400000000005s)]
*  why in the world would you preempt a scheduled negotiation with airstrikes, which the United [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5548.8s)]
*  States would participate in? [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5555.919999999999s)]
*  Do you think the US is driving this or Israel is driving this and we're just... [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5556.719999999999s)]
*  Well, it's a combination of both. And by the way, Israel is a country with 9 million people in it. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5559.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's the Israeli government, but there are also elements of the US government. The head of [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5566.879999999999s)]
*  CENTCOM is in favor of this. There are a number of Republican senators who are in favor of this, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5571.599999999999s)]
*  who are lying. For example, here's one, I think, interesting point that's a statement of fact. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5576.639999999999s)]
*  There's no American intelligence, this is a statement of fact, that suggests Iran is in the [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5581.44s)]
*  process of assembling a nuclear weapon or within months of doing so. There's none. And yet, Tom [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5587.919999999999s)]
*  Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the Intel committee, is out there saying, you know, we know [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5593.759999999999s)]
*  that they're doing this. Well, actually, you don't know that. That's not true. Whether he believes [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5598.799999999999s)]
*  it or not, I can't say. But that's a lie. Our intel does not say that, period. So why... [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5601.919999999999s)]
*  So they're lying because military industrial complex... [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5608.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think they're a whole... It's not as simple as, oh, BB wants it. I mean, [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5612.72s)]
*  I think this is a very complicated coalition of aligned interests. But whatever their motives, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5618.24s)]
*  I don't even need to know their motives. This is not a timetable that we need to adhere to. It's [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5625.52s)]
*  a completely artificial timetable. The president has done his best to resolve this diplomatically. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5631.36s)]
*  That's clearly his stated preference. He said it a million times. And he's being bum rushed [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5637.04s)]
*  into making a very snap decision that could have bigger consequences than we're thinking through. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5641.6s)]
*  So I'm very concerned about it. Shemov, what's your thoughts here? Can Iran have a nuclear weapon? [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5650.88s)]
*  And should the United States participate in, if they do have one imminently, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5659.28s)]
*  which is a big debate, obviously, should we be involved in stopping them or should we be [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5666.4s)]
*  doing negotiations, soft power, et cetera? I think this is where I'm glad that it's [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5673.5199999999995s)]
*  President Trump in the seat. I think he's shown a consistent desire to off ramp all of these [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5679.679999999999s)]
*  conflicts. And if he and Witkoff can hopefully hold the line with Bibi and everybody else, [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5684.32s)]
*  I think we're way, way, way better off. But you see this. Every time we're on the verge of victory, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5692.24s)]
*  somebody in the military industrial complex invents some escalation of something so that [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5698.88s)]
*  we can just go to war. The answer always seems to be let's go to war or let's support a war or let's [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5704.32s)]
*  enable a war. And the bulwark to that has been the president. If we go to war, Tucker's right. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5710.64s)]
*  This totally screws everything up. I mean, you could see oil double, double. What happens to [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5717.12s)]
*  the economy of the world, of world GDP, of everything, of inflation if you have oil at [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5725.4400000000005s)]
*  100 bucks a barrel, 112 bucks a barrel? It's not good. So you have to wonder like, why would people [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5730.64s)]
*  want this escalation? Who wants this escalation? And you see that it's deeply beneficial for [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5737.76s)]
*  America to avoid anything calamitous happening here. So I hope we find an off ramp and I hope [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5745.04s)]
*  that the president gets his way. One thing people should know about Iran is that there is a massive [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5750.88s)]
*  demographic switch happening here. You can see a chart. Is this from your paid newsletter site? [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5757.84s)]
*  This is yeah, this is from chamath.substack.com. $1,000 a year, $700 a month. You get to have [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5764.16s)]
*  lunch with him twice a year. Is this from chooseyourresponsibleparty.org? No, this is [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5769.44s)]
*  from founder.universityapplications coming in for around the world. Here we go. Take your [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5774.72s)]
*  nicotine patch and come to Founder University. Iran 2020, if you look at the number of millennials, [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5782.08s)]
*  Gen Xers, this is not a boomer country. And they're going to have a revolution when all those [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5789.76s)]
*  30 year olds you see there, that big fat middle, 30 and 40 year olds who are on VPNs right now, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5796.0s)]
*  and reading and watching what's happening in the West, you do not need to interfere with this [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5802.4800000000005s)]
*  country. You just need to let those 30 year olds become 40 and 50 year olds and take over the [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5807.68s)]
*  country. We need to negotiate heavily. The idea of going in there and creating a war with Iran is [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5811.68s)]
*  exactly probably what those older people want. Demographics are destiny. And this is an amazing [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5817.92s)]
*  actual Anthony Bourdain episode from Iran. And he said it was his favorite episode, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5823.2s)]
*  rest in peace, Anthony Bourdain. But the demographics here are just going to drive this change. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5827.2s)]
*  You know, your ability as a moderator to cover so much ground. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qErgCnUcQis&t=5830.56s)]
