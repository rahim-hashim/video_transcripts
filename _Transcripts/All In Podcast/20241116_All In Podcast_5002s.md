**All In Podcast:** [November 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU)
*  Hey, everybody. Welcome back to the all in podcast with us again today. Yawning from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=0.0s)]
*  Milan, your favorite, the chairman dictator Chamath Paliha Patia. You look a little tired, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=7.84s)]
*  my friend. How you doing over there, buddy? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=14.88s)]
*  I left Monday, I flew to Singapore. I was on the ground for two days. And I flew here. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=16.76s)]
*  I'm here for two days and then I go to London. Five days. I'm exhausted. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=26.36s)]
*  You are on a whirlwind tour. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=31.32s)]
*  I mean, I'm based I'm flying around the world. Literally flying around the world. Moving west. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=33.56s)]
*  Man, right. I'm tired. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=41.0s)]
*  And this is all in service. I mean, at our age, you feel people it hits differently when you when [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=42.92s)]
*  you pass 40. And I'm assuming this is 8090 business, you're out there selling, you selling, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=49.56s)]
*  you're selling grok, you're selling 8090. You're out there doing BD. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=55.0s)]
*  Little selling little closing. And then I'm speaking at the Oxford Union on Wednesday. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=59.4s)]
*  Okay, okay. Well, that sounds fancy. Check in the bucket list. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=64.84s)]
*  Okay, there you have it. And in his camo hat, and in his election. Afterglow. Look at the glow. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=69.64s)]
*  He is in that afterglow. He is post coitus here post election. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=78.52s)]
*  Anybody got a cigarette? I need to light up the cigarette. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=84.44s)]
*  That was a close one. I didn't think I was gonna make it but you did. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=90.2s)]
*  Do you like my camo hat? J. Cal? This is what this is a hat. Well, it says Trump fans. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=93.32s)]
*  You look like no more fun. What does it say? Your hunting lives. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=97.88s)]
*  No, remember, remember when Tim Walz rolled out the camo hat. And you said it was going to win [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=101.0s)]
*  the election for Harris. It might. I thought that he might have a shot. Yes. Yeah, I was wrong about [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=106.6s)]
*  that one. Be very, very quiet. We got all the camo guys. They voted for us hunting liberals. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=111.4s)]
*  Nobody's gonna get this person. It's very good. It looks like is that Elmer Fudd? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=117.80000000000001s)]
*  That's Elmer Fudd. Be very, very quiet. We're hunting liberals. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=123.24000000000001s)]
*  That sounds like Mike Tyson. Well, I'm gonna mess up that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=127.4s)]
*  Jake Paul. How about I wear a different Trump hat every week for the next four years? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely fantastic. I mean, the ratings on the show. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=137.0s)]
*  I mean, all I care about at this point, I'm getting savage in any way possible. All I care [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  about is ratings. Now let's go. You're fine. Maga, get in the comments. Let's get these ratings up. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=147.08s)]
*  And with us, of course, the CEO of Oh, hello. Oh, hello. David Freeberg. How you doing? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=153.32s)]
*  Thanks for having me again, J. Cal. Thank you. All right. Well, it's good to be here. Yeah. How [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=161.8s)]
*  you doing? I'm chilling, man. You know, just nice to the executive producer to how you're on the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=167.08s)]
*  show. Yeah. I've been producing here. Well, it's always, I'm always thinking about your best [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=172.52s)]
*  interest. I was hearing a little, I heard you on a phone call before you said you had a perfect [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=178.68s)]
*  body. What was that in reference to? My wife makes me go. Yeah. She makes me go to the dermatologist [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  where they, she examines your whole nude body to look for moles. So this morning I went in early [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=187.96s)]
*  to the dermatologist. She examined it. She said, perfect. I said, does she have to wear sunglasses? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=193.56s)]
*  Cause you're just so white. Like it just like it's blindingly white. She's a woman. Did she get hazard [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=199.56s)]
*  pay? The poor, that poor dermatologist. My God. She's like, she's like, thank you for the experience. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=205.16s)]
*  But this is why we need to, uh, in all seriousness, this is why sacks. We have to legalize psychedelics. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=211.0s)]
*  This poor woman has PTSD after that. We need to get out of here. Get out of here. It was a wonderful [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  examination. She was thrilled. I mean, okay. And, uh, of course I'm Jason Kallikannis [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=223.24s)]
*  and, uh, you know, there's been a lot of scuttlebutt sacks. I don't know if you know this, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=229.72s)]
*  but, uh, comedy might still be legal here on the all in pockets, but there's been a lot of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  scuttlebutt, a lot of debate, a lot of energy, dare I say around, are we going to break the rules [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=237.96s)]
*  today? Finally? I don't know. We'll see. Anything's possible. People get a little sensitive. Sometimes [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=243.0s)]
*  with the car. Do I have to put my pronouns back in my zoom chat? Or you're so proud. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=248.04s)]

*  this? Are you aware that the appointments are being made? I'm aware. Yeah. You have seen, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=262.28s)]
*  you've seen the flow of them. Well, I got a dump. I'm not going to say who sent these to me, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=266.52s)]
*  but I actually got the next five or six announcement that Trump's going to make. I'm [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=272.36s)]
*  not going to say who gave it to me. This is, this bit has the potential to be so good. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=277.48s)]
*  I'm so tired, but you've got me awake. I'm awake. Well, here's our first one. Here's our first one. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=284.12s)]

*  competition from Mark Cuban for that, for that post. I know I beat him out. I beat him out. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=352.59999999999997s)]

*  Retribution must be had. J Cal. Payback is a bench. There were a lot of people who were out of line, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=402.76s)]
*  just a little bit, a little bit. They deserve to get smacked out a little bit. Just a little bit. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=408.92s)]

*  All right. Let's get into it. Everybody. I just want to start with a little bit of finance here, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=477.64s)]
*  Bitcoin and finance stocks way up since the Trump win, which was now 10 days ago. Bitcoin peaked at [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=482.44s)]
*  92,000. Unbelievable. It's dropped down to 89, but obviously that's an all time high. And [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=491.0s)]
*  as we all know, we talked about it on the show. Trump heavily, heavily courted the crypto industry [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=500.6s)]
*  during his campaign. In addition to the Bitcoin news, since early August, a firm Robinhood, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=505.32s)]
*  PayPal, Coinbase all up double or 50%. It's an extraordinary run. In July, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=511.96s)]
*  Trump headlined a Bitcoin conference. He laid out his plans. Number one, he was going to fire [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=519.4799999999999s)]
*  SEC chairman, Gary Gensler. Here's the clip. One day one, I will fire Gary Gensler and appoint a [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=524.92s)]
*  SEC chairman. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=532.4399999999999s)]
*  I didn't know he was that unpopular. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=533.56s)]
*  Let me say it again. On day one, I will fire Gary Gensler. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=546.04s)]
*  There it is. Okay. Enough with that. Technically president can't fire the SEC chair, but he can [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=566.04s)]
*  appoint a new one when Gary's term ends in 2026, or Gary could resign from takes office. That [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=571.96s)]
*  happens sometimes. And folks are speculating Gensler has already made that decision to step down. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=578.2800000000001s)]
*  He put out a press release with a quote in it that a number of people took note of where he said, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=585.0s)]
*  it's been a great honor to serve with them, the people who work at the SEC, doing the people's [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=590.9200000000001s)]
*  work and ensuring our capital markets remain the best in the world. Trump also said the federal [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=595.8000000000001s)]
*  government will never sell, never ever sell its Bitcoin holdings, which they own through criminal [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=600.92s)]
*  assets, as you know. And number three, he said he would create a Bitcoin and crypto presidential [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=606.92s)]
*  advisory council where Trump said, quote, the rules will be written by people who love your [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=613.9599999999999s)]
*  industry, not heat or industry. And he also advocated that all future bitcoins would be [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=619.9599999999999s)]
*  minted in America. I don't know that he gets to make that choice, but they have it freeberg. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=626.36s)]
*  Any thoughts here on the crypto market and this incredible bull run here we've seen in the last, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=630.52s)]
*  you know, 10 days and then before that couple of months. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=638.76s)]
*  I mean, I think, like you said, it's not limited to crypto. Crypto is one market of several that [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=641.0799999999999s)]
*  have been significantly affected by the outlook based on Trump's election. I think that Trump's [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=645.64s)]
*  election has a couple of key features that are changing market dynamics. One is folks kind of [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=652.04s)]
*  view some of his policies to be obviously stimulatory with lower tax rates and more [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=659.32s)]
*  deregulation. This is, you know, theoretically going to drive up investment and economic growth. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=665.1600000000001s)]
*  The deregulatory nature on its own benefits markets that have been encumbered by regulatory [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=670.44s)]
*  oversight and regulatory challenges like crypto, finance and fintech. So those types of businesses [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=676.36s)]
*  are clearly going to benefit or expected to benefit significantly by being able to launch [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=682.36s)]
*  products more quickly and have features and ways that they can generate revenue that they might be [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=687.8s)]
*  challenged to do under the current regulatory schemas. And then there's also this element of [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=691.56s)]
*  kind of things being inflationary, the feature of tariffs. If we don't get spending cut fast enough, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=696.52s)]
*  there's an effect on markets. So, you know, we're still seeing 10-year treasury sit at about 4.5%, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=701.8s)]
*  up from 3.5%, which is where we were right around the rate cut beginning in September. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=707.0799999999999s)]
*  And remember, since those rate cuts began in September, we've cut 75 basis points. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=711.56s)]
*  And we're still seeing the kind of 10-year treasury hold high, which kind of implies that [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=715.88s)]
*  there's expected to be persistent inflation. In fact, the October inflation number accelerated [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=721.16s)]
*  again. So it's back up, not going down. I think it went up to 2.6% up from 2.3% the month prior. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=725.8s)]
*  These general kind of effects that are predicted from the Trump policy plans is having an effect [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=732.6s)]
*  in different markets. Obviously, in equities, we're seeing more kind of risk seeking, risk taking. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=738.04s)]
*  And then in the bond markets, because of the 4.5% treasury yield, there's a really interesting [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=742.68s)]
*  dynamic. And I kind of sent this link out yesterday. But if you look at the spread on yields [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=749.4s)]
*  between US treasuries, which have historically been kind of considered and talked about and are [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=757.4s)]
*  deemed the risk-free rate, and the yield that corporates have to pay to borrow money, we haven't [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=761.9599999999999s)]
*  seen a spread this low in 26 years. So it's a 17-year low for the spread between the yield [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=770.44s)]
*  that companies that issue junk bonds have to pay from treasuries. And it's a 26-year low [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=779.1600000000001s)]
*  for credit grade bonds. So this means the market is either more risk seeking, meaning they're [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=786.0400000000001s)]
*  looking for more yield and they're going into corporates because they feel like there is a [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=790.5200000000001s)]
*  higher probability that these companies are going to be successful in the future, they're not going [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=794.7600000000001s)]
*  to have higher default rates, etc. So the market is becoming much more risk seeking. Or the [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=798.68s)]
*  alternative is that parts of the market are reassessing the risk-free nature of treasuries [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=804.68s)]
*  themselves. If spending doesn't get under control, the treasury market appetite is decreasing. So [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=809.0s)]
*  there's this kind of spread that's shrunk in the last couple of months. So we're seeing capital [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=814.5999999999999s)]
*  flooding into the markets for risk seeking assets. And this is obviously affecting crypto, equities, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=818.92s)]
*  and bond markets all across the board. And we'll talk a little bit about IPO and M&A later. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=823.9599999999999s)]
*  Great. Shamath, your thoughts aside from yum yum? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=828.44s)]
*  I mean, yum yum, you could say it. It's going to be just saying. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=833.0s)]
*  No, I mean, look, what did I say at the beginning of the year was going to be the biggest [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=839.88s)]
*  risk asset winning trade? Yeah, it's great. Bitcoin's great. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=845.16s)]
*  Lord, I haven't seen you this generally. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=851.48s)]
*  What made you more happy getting to mom on and spending time with your white truffle dealer, [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=853.4s)]
*  or watching Bitcoin break 90k? Which one was more exciting for you? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=859.8s)]
*  Oh, you know, honestly, you know what I think about? I actually think about all the Bitcoin I sold. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=864.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I had Bitcoin, I had a bunch of Bitcoin in my funds when I managed outside capital. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=868.76s)]
*  You know, that's a, I don't know, a three or $4 billion mistake and growing now, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=877.16s)]
*  because my partners at the time capitulated and I wanted to be a good team member and we distributed [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=881.7199999999999s)]
*  and it was profitable. But obviously, I shouldn't have sold it, would have made them a lot more [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=888.04s)]
*  money. And then I think about like, I bought some land. I remember Tahoe. It was in the Wall Street [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=893.56s)]
*  Journal. I'm sure you can find it. But yeah, how much is that worth now? Probably a couple [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=901.64s)]
*  hundred million dollars, maybe more. Rough trade, rough trade. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=906.68s)]
*  But you do have Bitcoin holding. Can I ask you a question? Why do you say [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=909.56s)]
*  sold Bitcoin, as opposed to converted Bitcoin into dollars? Like when you think about Bitcoin, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=913.88s)]
*  just as a participant, do you think about Bitcoin as a dollar denominated asset? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=919.8s)]
*  And then you're eventually going to sell it, turn it back into dollars and use the dollars? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=925.88s)]
*  Or are you like, what do you think about the purest kind of idea that Bitcoin should be [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=929.16s)]
*  the de facto currency and store value in the future and the dollar doesn't matter? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=933.4799999999999s)]
*  And we shouldn't necessarily be talking about the value of Bitcoin in dollar denominated terms as [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=937.9599999999999s)]
*  something I'm going to eventually turn it back into. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=942.28s)]
*  It hasn't happened yet. And so until it happens, I think you have to view it as like a [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=944.52s)]
*  who knows what kind of value it is. And then you have to look at it in terms of the value of the [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=949.0799999999999s)]
*  value of Bitcoin. And you have to view it as like a very good gold proxy. But it's a largely [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=954.52s)]
*  dollar denominated asset. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=968.44s)]
*  Now, why do you see it going the other way? Like, so a lot of folks thought that as a safe haven, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=970.28s)]
*  it should do well when there's a negative economic outlook. But it has traded the last couple years, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=975.24s)]
*  kind of the opposite. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=981.08s)]
*  Correlated asset. I mean, yeah, there will be a point. And it's probably in our lifetime, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=981.88s)]
*  where it is an independent asset and a non speculative store of value. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=990.2s)]
*  There will be that day, but that day is not now. And I think it's very important [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=997.96s)]
*  to see the conditions on the field as they are versus what you wish it to be. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1002.92s)]
*  And the reason is that it allows you to risk manage more appropriately. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1007.56s)]
*  Because if you don't see it, then when something happens to the dollar complex, good or bad, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1012.2s)]
*  or when something happens to rates, good or bad, or when something stimulative happens, good or bad, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1019.0s)]
*  you're not going to react properly if you're in the business of managing it as a risk asset. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1025.0s)]
*  So if you're in the set it and forget it bucket, and there are some people, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1029.88s)]
*  I think it's great. None of these conversations matter. But like most people, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1035.08s)]
*  you're probably going to be motivated to do something. And I think if you're motivated [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1039.88s)]
*  to do something, or you have FOMO that stimulates you to do something, whatever the psychology is [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1046.2s)]
*  that leads you to action, it's probably important to just view things as they really are versus how [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1051.24s)]
*  you wish them to be. And so I think the purists may eventually be right. I think they will be [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1057.88s)]
*  right at some point in my lifetime, but they're not right now. And that's why these things are [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1063.48s)]
*  correlated. The other the other thing I'll say just broadly about the market is, I think that [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1068.2s)]
*  there's a tremendous amount of optimism about the economy. I think that's why you see risk spreads [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1074.68s)]
*  get definitely Yeah. And I think that as long as we see the kind of prognostications that the Trump [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1079.4s)]
*  administration is putting out, I think people are going to be mostly bullish. I think the way that [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1087.64s)]
*  this trade turns around is when something actually breaks in terms of the inflation picture, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1094.12s)]
*  or in terms of the deficit picture. And if those things look like going into 2025, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1102.9199999999998s)]
*  that President Trump's actions are not going to be able to course correct it, then I think you're [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1109.4799999999998s)]
*  going to see people go massively risk off, which I think will not be great for markets, obviously. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1113.9599999999998s)]
*  Right now, we're not in that point. And you don't think that tenure reflects that already at four [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1120.52s)]
*  and a half percent? I mean, that's showing some degree of inflation and concern about the deficit. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1125.24s)]
*  Right. It's like, I think, I think the tenure could be at 7%. Yeah. What does four and a half [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1132.12s)]
*  percent mean? I mean, if you're if you're going to run 8% of GDP level deficits for the next four or [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1139.96s)]
*  five or six years, you're going to have the tenure at 7%, 8%. That's just mathematical. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1147.24s)]
*  Right. Sacks, your thoughts on crypto before we get into IPOs and M&A? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1155.08s)]
*  Yeah, just on crypto, the House Republicans already passed a framework for crypto regulation [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1162.1200000000001s)]
*  earlier this year. It actually got 71 Democrats to join it. It was called the Financial Innovation [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1167.96s)]
*  and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT 21. And it would classify digital assets like crypto [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1174.2s)]
*  as commodities regulated by the CFTC. If the blockchain they run on is, is, quote, functional [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1181.4s)]
*  and decentralized, that's the key requirement. If their blockchain is functional, but not [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1186.76s)]
*  decentralized, then they would be considered securities and fall under the purview of the SEC. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1192.44s)]
*  I think the crypto industry basically wants a really clear line for knowing when there are [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1197.48s)]
*  commodity and they want commodities to be governed, governed like all other commodities [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1202.68s)]
*  by the CFTC. So that's what the Republican bill would do. I think with the Republicans [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1207.3200000000002s)]
*  now winning the Senate, the prospects for that bill to get enacted are now greatly improved, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1212.2s)]
*  especially because Sherrod Brown, who used to run the Banking Committee, just lost to Bernie [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1218.04s)]
*  Moreno. This was a seat in Ohio. Elizabeth Warren is still going to object to this legislation, but [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1224.2s)]
*  she's just going to have way less influence. And like you said, it's not clear [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1231.56s)]
*  that Gary Gensler is going to be sticking around very long at the SEC. So, look, the bottom line [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1235.24s)]
*  here is that I think that we are close to having clear rules of the road codified by Congress, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1239.8799999999999s)]
*  which is what the crypto industry has been asking for. And the days of Gensler terrorizing crypto [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1246.04s)]
*  companies by issuing Wells notices without clarifying what the rules are that he is prosecuting, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1251.08s)]
*  those days are about to be over. So I think this is why the crypto markets are rallying. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1257.48s)]
*  And so to your point, if it's centralized or partially centralized, you're going to be a [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1263.32s)]
*  security. If you're decentralized, anybody can join the network. No one person controls the network. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1269.24s)]
*  And I guess most people would consider that Bitcoin versus say Ripple, which is partially [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1275.56s)]
*  decentralized, but largely centralized. And that's going to be, I guess, the new rules of the road. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1279.8s)]
*  In addition to that, there are new rules that are being enforced that hopefully Trump supports. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1285.32s)]
*  Assuming FIT 21 passes, right? This bill is called FIT 21. But I think much, much higher likelihood [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1290.9199999999998s)]
*  that it or something like it now can get through the Congress. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1297.08s)]
*  Makes sense. Yeah. And then there's also legislation that's already been enacted. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1299.72s)]
*  There's multiple ways and multiple paths, but accredited investors, there's going to be a path [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1305.08s)]
*  to becoming an accredited investor with a test. So that is something that is also on the docket. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1310.6s)]
*  We'll see if it happens. Let's talk about IPOs and M&A. Yum, yum, boys. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1315.48s)]
*  Just a level set here with the audience. Here's the number of IPOs per year. And as you can see, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1320.12s)]
*  the last three years have been some of the lowest since 2008 and 2009. The great recession, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1327.56s)]
*  for those of you who are old enough to remember it. And if you look at VC, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1334.68s)]
*  the number of distributions have been absolutely on the floor for the past three years. In fact, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1340.76s)]
*  if you look at the distribution from 2022 through 2024, those three years combined, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1347.0800000000002s)]
*  it's been around 200 billion, which is less than 2019 in total. And with this year projected to be [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1352.1200000000001s)]
*  about 100 billion in distributions, that's about 14% of the peak ZERP era. When in 2021, we had [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1360.52s)]
*  $710 billion in distribution here. So the backroom buzz is that Donnie from Queens is going to make [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1368.6s)]
*  M&A great again. Couple of reasons there. Saks, the wrath of Lena Kahn's coming to an end. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1378.6s)]
*  Mag seven sitting on massive amounts of cash and that cash is growing as people have laid people [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1385.16s)]
*  off and they're focused on getting fit. Obviously, we all know the Fed did another quarter point cut [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1390.76s)]
*  last week, although some people maybe don't know that because it seems to have gotten lost in the [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1397.72s)]
*  election news. And psychologically, I think everybody's feeling very optimistic. So maybe [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1401.48s)]
*  these IPOs are back on the menu. Jamath, I don't know if you saw it, but Klarna just filed for [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1407.8s)]
*  their IPO. That's a Swedish fintech company. They were kind of the pioneers in buy now, pay later. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1412.92s)]
*  What are the other IPOs we could see file in 2025? Databricks, Stripe, Wiz, Canva, Plaid, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1419.0s)]
*  Rippling and Airtable. There's a long shot that people have been buzzing about. I don't have any [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1426.1200000000001s)]
*  inside information, but people have been speculating SpaceX could IPO Starlink, their Starlink unit. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1431.3200000000002s)]
*  And if you want to get really crazy, Jamath, maybe there's a long shot that Sam Altman jumps [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1437.0s)]
*  the fence and decides he's going to take open AI public during this window that people expect [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1442.12s)]
*  to be opening. What do you think Jamath? What's going to happen here in terms of M&A and IPOs in 2025? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1447.56s)]
*  I think it's going to still be pretty subdued. Subdued, okay. I don't think that you're going to [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1454.1999999999998s)]
*  see these crazy M&A deals that I think everybody is expecting. I also don't anticipate [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1460.12s)]
*  a lot of these big companies going public at least in the first half of the year. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1470.76s)]
*  And the only reason I say that is I just think that this year and the first half of next year, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1476.8400000000001s)]
*  what's the difference? The IPO market is what the IPO market is. And if the 10 year [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1485.0800000000002s)]
*  is back to 4.5%, 5%, that's not a compelling strategy for some SaaS company [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1490.1200000000001s)]
*  or some internet business that didn't take an opportunity to go public when rates were at zero. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1495.64s)]
*  So if you just look mathematically at what the actual fair value of these companies should be, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1504.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know, it's not like such a great IPO market. Then on the M&A side, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1511.0800000000002s)]
*  if all you're doing is waiting for LinaCon to not be there, to me, I think that that betrays what [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1515.5600000000002s)]
*  M&A is supposed to be, which is you're supposed to underwrite some industrial logic from first [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1523.08s)]
*  principles where things are very accretive and very accretive things should not hang by a thread [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1527.8799999999999s)]
*  on the emotional regulation or dysregulation of the FTC commissioner. So I kind of think that [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1536.12s)]
*  you would have seen some of this stuff already as well if the industrial logic was so high. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1544.12s)]
*  And again, when rates are non-trivially high, I just think that it's not the easiest thing in [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1549.4s)]
*  the world to pull off like a really big M&A event, nor is it a really easy thing to pull off to pull [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1554.28s)]
*  off a huge IPO. Again, there's a reason why Warren Buffett has $325 billion sitting in T-bills, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1558.84s)]
*  making 4.5% a year. He owns more T-bills than the United States government. He's making about $15 [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1566.84s)]
*  billion a year in interest. When you can do that with absolutely no risk, again, relative to stocks [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1572.92s)]
*  at least, what is this IPO going to give you? Yeah, Jamal's right. The 10 years at 4.5%, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1580.6000000000001s)]
*  you're basically paying 20 times cash flow to own a risk-free bond, the US Treasury bond. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1585.96s)]
*  Or you can pay 23 times to own a totally risky asset. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1592.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's 30 times to own the S&P 500 right now. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1595.64s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1599.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, but there is a lot of risk-seeking shifting happening, Jamal. We talked about [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1600.1200000000001s)]
*  some of the crypto stuff, some of the fintech stuff, deregulation, that the PE might seem high [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1605.0s)]
*  today, but if you forecast out 10 years for some of these businesses in a deregulated, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1611.0800000000002s)]
*  de-taxed environment, or reduced tax, reduced regulation environment, that the earnings should [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1617.3200000000002s)]
*  accelerate in a way that outpaces the multiple you're getting today. This is part of why some [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1623.24s)]
*  of the fintech companies are ripping right now, why some of the finance companies are ripping [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1629.48s)]
*  right now. If under Trump and the Republican control of the House and Senate, laws don't pass [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1633.32s)]
*  and regulations get reduced, theoretically, earnings are going to rip and you should pay [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1638.84s)]
*  a higher multiple today because you're actually buying these things at 8 to 10 times earnings [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1643.4s)]
*  five years from now. So there seems to be some risk appetite there, but I do agree with Jamal [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1647.64s)]
*  on the M&A point. If you think about what's gone on over the last couple of years- [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1652.1200000000001s)]
*  Hold on a second. Can I ask you a question? Do you think that regulation is the reason why [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1657.0s)]
*  these SaaS companies have never made a dollar profit? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1660.44s)]
*  No, I'm not talking about SaaS. I'm not talking about SaaS. I'm talking about industrial companies. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1664.12s)]
*  No, the fintech market. So we were talking about fintech and some of these assets earlier, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1669.56s)]
*  some of these equities that have been ripping. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1675.88s)]
*  It's a very narrow part of the economy. If you look on a broad-based basis, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1677.48s)]
*  the tens and tens of trillions of dollars of market cap that exists, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1683.5600000000002s)]
*  I do agree with you that deregulation benefits a bunch of those companies, but it benefits [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1688.28s)]
*  sort of the non-tech businesses more than the tech businesses. The tech businesses right now [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1694.8400000000001s)]
*  are relatively lightly regulated. I would think that it benefits pharma businesses. It benefits [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1698.92s)]
*  ag businesses. It benefits real estate companies. It benefits a whole swath of the economy, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1703.8000000000002s)]
*  but we've started to see that rerating, and maybe we'll see a lot more. So maybe, Jason, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1710.52s)]
*  the more nuanced answer to your question is the kind of M&A that I think you want to see, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1715.56s)]
*  let's face it, that we all want to see here because we all have a vested interest, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1719.8s)]
*  which is really specifically tech M&A. I don't think that any of this deregulation particularly [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1723.48s)]
*  accelerates that, but maybe a more nuanced take on this would be that these other more regulated [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1728.44s)]
*  parts of the economy could do well and catch up to some of the earnings potential or the forward [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1736.12s)]
*  pricing of the tech businesses. But again, now you get into this weird trade where you can buy [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1741.3999999999999s)]
*  steady cash flowing businesses that can grow in valuation as fast as a fast growing but money [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1748.84s)]
*  losing tech business, but then you trade both of those two things off, and it has effectively the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1755.8799999999999s)]
*  same yield as a 10 year. What do you do? Yeah. Yeah. I think there's a lot of backed up [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1760.6s)]
*  inventory where venture capital is boards and founders, people who control and make these [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1769.9599999999998s)]
*  decisions on M&A, if they would sell the company to a larger company, I think there's a lot of [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1775.08s)]
*  exhaustion in the market and that will drive the capitulation on valuation. What do you think the [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1781.08s)]
*  valuations will be? Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, they'll be here, but I'm watching it right now. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1786.6s)]
*  I mean, you think Warren Buffett's going to take 325 billion of cash? No, no, but I do. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1791.56s)]
*  He won't even buy his own stock. So I think he's going to pay in terms of a multiple. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1795.7199999999998s)]
*  I think it will be more like Salesforce or Microsoft or Google or Amazon getting off the [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1799.6399999999999s)]
*  sidelines because they've looked at and said, you know what, the juice ain't worth the squeeze. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1804.76s)]
*  We might as well put our efforts and our capital into buying big hardware and building new products [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1808.36s)]
*  and services. But if they think, Hey, I got a chance of pulling this through, I'm sitting on [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1814.2s)]
*  all this cash. What if I hit another YouTube and Instagram, you know, really great acquisitions that [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1817.64s)]
*  were transformative for those two companies. Meta would not be where it is right now. Facebook, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1823.64s)]
*  you know that Welchum up if they hadn't gotten Instagram. And certainly, you know, Friedberg, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1827.8s)]
*  as an alumni of Google, if they didn't get YouTube, it would be a completely different picture for [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1832.44s)]
*  that company right now. I think there's a lot of those type of acquisitions. Hold on. I think [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1836.3600000000001s)]
*  there's a lot of those acquisitions that have been sitting there waiting. And I'm watching the [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1840.6s)]
*  secondary markets to your question. What's the discount going to be? The discount was last year, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1844.4399999999998s)]
*  I kid you not 70 8090% off the last round for SaaS companies. And this year, it's 20 or 30. I'm [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1849.8s)]
*  seeing this when I'm getting offers to buy our shares in some private SaaS companies, some private [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1857.3999999999999s)]
*  fintech companies. And then I also think if you're a CEO, and you watch Robin Hood, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1862.04s)]
*  Uber, Reddit, door dash, and Instacart, those five have actually after getting a little bit of a [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1869.3999999999999s)]
*  gas kicking, when they first went out, they have all rebounded massively. And for the people who [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1877.32s)]
*  held on to their Reddit shares, Robin Hood shares, Uber shares, they have been rewarded massively, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1883.0s)]
*  for having faith in you know, through this storm. So I think those two things, the capitulation of [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1889.0s)]
*  all these boards and founders are going to say, you know what, let's take the haircut, let's go [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1894.52s)]
*  public. And let's tell our story and see if we can make it work as a public company. And then the [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1899.0800000000002s)]
*  people who feel one step weaker than that, I think they want to cash their chips in they've been in [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1904.2s)]
*  some of these investments, Jamal, it's year 11, 12, 13, 14. For some of these private companies, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1908.68s)]
*  there is capitulation on those boards, people are exhausted. So that I just I'm going to, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1913.64s)]
*  I'm going to take the other side of the argument on this one. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1917.4s)]
*  I'll kind of play along. So I think, and I'll disagree a little bit for a couple different [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1919.4s)]
*  reasons. These big tech companies, the ones that have had, you know, media businesses or, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1925.48s)]
*  because remember, there's tech, that's tech, right? Nvidia does not have a media business. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1932.2s)]
*  But there's been a conversation over the last couple of years, where we need to break up big [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1935.88s)]
*  tech has been kind of part of the conversation with the Dems. And now the Republicans are coming in, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1940.6000000000001s)]
*  and they're saying the same thing, we got to break up big tech. So there, I think, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1944.36s)]
*  are a few of these companies, Google being one of them that are very much handicapped right now, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1947.56s)]
*  with respect to what kind of M&A they can do without dealing with the regulatory sledgehammer [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1951.8s)]
*  coming down on them. So I don't think that those guys are buyers, J Cal, I don't think that Google's [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1958.28s)]
*  in a place right now where they can go out and make a bunch of acquisitions, they're going to [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1961.9599999999998s)]
*  do everything they can to avoid the regulatory sledgehammer that's coming their way. First, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1965.1599999999999s)]
*  it was coming from the Dems. Now it's coming from the new administration. There's a bunch of other [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1969.6399999999999s)]
*  companies that don't really fit that bill, like Microsoft probably doesn't fit that bill, Nvidia, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1973.56s)]
*  Adobe, maybe they'll make some acquisitions. But I don't think it's as simple as, well, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1978.28s)]
*  we'll sell at a low price, we'll buy at a low price. I'm just not sure they really need to do [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1983.3999999999999s)]
*  that right now. I completely agree with you. I completely agree. I think that these big tech [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1987.6399999999999s)]
*  companies will need to pay a pound of flesh for the deplatforming and the censorship that they did. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=1993.48s)]
*  And our perfect time if we're going to go to the political angle to bring you in, [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2001.5600000000002s)]
*  Sax, what are the vibes? My perception is Trump likes to win. Trump wants to see the economy soar. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2005.24s)]
*  That is his platform. He's a business guy. I think he wants to see fluidity. I know JD [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2012.92s)]
*  has been not a fan of like the Google's, etc. So maybe you could help us navigate this. Who's [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2019.16s)]
*  right here? What's the possibility of M&A becoming more vibrant in a Trump administration? [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2024.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, there's no question that in general, President Trump wants to have the most vibrant [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2031.48s)]
*  economy we can have. And I think to that end, you're going to see the end of this era of [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2035.96s)]
*  deceleration, of regulatory capture, and lawfare. I think all those things are over. I think that [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2041.96s)]
*  equities that have been straining or tamped down under the weight of these abuses, you see them [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2049.4s)]
*  ripping now. For example, Tesla, it's gone from roughly $250 to $320 a share since the election. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2056.6s)]
*  And you could call that the lawfare discount. I mean, that basically is the discount on Tesla [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2063.56s)]
*  stock because the market was pricing in the risk of retaliation. If the Republicans lost, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2068.12s)]
*  there's a widespread belief that the Democrats would go after Elon and his company. So you can [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2074.2799999999997s)]
*  actually measure the lawfare discount based on Tesla stock. And some part of regulation, right? [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2079.96s)]
*  Because there's a lot of regulations around self-driving, rocket ship launches, all those [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2084.28s)]
*  things he's involved in. There's a lot of regulation. There's this crazy thing where they [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2087.96s)]
*  made some regulator made him put a headset on a seal. Did you see this to test the effect on [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2092.2000000000003s)]
*  the sound of loud noises? The sonic booms. This poor seal. Do you see this poor seal? [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2098.36s)]
*  Don't do that to freeberg. Put it in post. I don't want to scream. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2105.2400000000002s)]
*  Don't put on the screen. It's freeburg. It's gonna anyway. So they subjected this poor seal [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2111.1600000000003s)]
*  to exactly the thing that they were worried would harm seals. In any event, the seals seem [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2115.7200000000003s)]
*  totally fine. It didn't. They torture sales to make a point. I got it. Yeah. Anyway, it's really [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2121.1600000000003s)]
*  crazy. So yeah, look, it is crazy. This crazy. What about this JD? It helped us navigate. I know JD [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2125.88s)]
*  is the VP. And then you have Trump is the CEO. Chamath pointed out maybe there's a little on the GOP [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2131.32s)]
*  anger, resentment, residual, because of the, you know, banning of Trump from YouTube and some of [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2137.48s)]
*  these other platforms. Do you think that makes its way into M&A or not? I guess, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2144.44s)]
*  Sacks, like, let me be specific to J. Cal's question. Not all tech companies are the same [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2148.52s)]
*  in that point of view, right? Thank you for touching it up. Yeah. Tech M&A generally is a [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2153.32s)]
*  thing, but specifically the companies that have had social media platforms, maybe kind of in a [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2157.48s)]
*  different lens from a regulatory perspective. Is that fair? Yeah. I mean, look, I think that [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2164.12s)]
*  not everything Lena Conn did was bad. In fact, she definitely has some fans among the populist [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2172.2s)]
*  Republicans. And, you know, some of them who've spoken out on her behalf in various areas have [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2177.72s)]
*  been JD Vance, Matt Gaetz as well. She did do some good things. Specifically, she was willing to [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2182.92s)]
*  take on the big tech companies. I mean, companies like Amazon, Apple, Google, frankly, they just had [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2188.6s)]
*  a free ride for the last couple of decades where they were allowed to do anything. And she came in [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2194.2s)]
*  and said there's a new sheriff in town and she was actually willing to apply pressure on them to not [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2198.92s)]
*  engage in anti-competitive tactics. So I think she deserves credit for that. I think she did [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2205.0s)]
*  change the conversation. I think that we've talked about on previous pods that perhaps [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2210.2799999999997s)]
*  there was not as targeted and surgical an approach was used. And as a result of that, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2214.84s)]
*  it did have a chilling effect on M&A. And so it hurt the, you know, the small tech environment. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2221.0s)]
*  And so I think that we need to fix that part of it. But I hope that whoever replaces Lena Conn will [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2227.2400000000002s)]
*  continue to apply pressure to big tech because they are monopolies and they will abuse their [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2232.44s)]
*  power if they're allowed to and they need to be controlled. Sax, if you had to handicap [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2237.2400000000002s)]
*  the probability of a lawsuit or some kind of attempt to dismantle Google and Facebook, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2242.36s)]
*  would those be the two companies at the top of your list? And how would you handicap that? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2254.68s)]
*  So my view is that Google should be broken up. There's abundant reasons for that. There's at [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2258.6s)]
*  least three monopolies in that company. And I think that's a good example of how Google should [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2263.64s)]
*  be broken up. There's the search business, the advertising business and YouTube. I think they [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2268.6s)]
*  should be busted up. What are the odds that that happens? It's hard to say, but what are the odds [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2275.56s)]
*  that that is pursued in the next administration in some capacity or at least investigated? I'd say [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2282.2799999999997s)]
*  high. I'd say Facebook or Meta less so. I don't see the compelling need to bust them up, but quite [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2288.2s)]
*  frankly, I think the issue that Meta is going to face is just there were a lot of abuses in terms [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2298.36s)]
*  of censoring the free speech rights of Americans. Now, I don't think that was all the company's idea. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2303.4s)]
*  I think a lot of pressure was put on the company by the Biden administration. I think they wanted [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2309.6400000000003s)]
*  to do the right thing and just didn't show enough backbone. I think Elon showed- [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2315.08s)]
*  But Zuckerberg's been clear that he regrets it. And he's bent the knee now. He's like, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2318.6s)]
*  listen, I'm not going to do it again. Yeah, he published a letter and maybe it was done [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2323.3199999999997s)]
*  to some degree to inoculate himself against the results of this election. But I'd say to his [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2328.12s)]
*  credit, it wasn't clear at all who was going to win the election when he put out that letter. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2332.9199999999996s)]
*  And he basically said that he regretted the fact that Meta had gone along with the censorship [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2336.9199999999996s)]
*  requests by the Biden administration. And he specifically referred to that whole Hunter Biden [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2342.9199999999996s)]
*  story that got censored in 2020 that was election interference. It was a completely true story [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2347.4s)]
*  by the New York Post. It got censored by big tech at the request of these 51 former intelligence [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2353.32s)]
*  officials who were lying through their teeth, claiming it was Russian disinformation. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2360.76s)]
*  So he clearly regrets going along with that. In any event, I think there are better ways of [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2365.32s)]
*  handling the speech issue on social networks than busting up Facebook. But I do think though that [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2370.6800000000003s)]
*  Congress should investigate or continue investigating what went wrong there and what exactly [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2375.64s)]
*  is the involvement of the intelligence community and the deep state in the censorship requests [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2381.88s)]
*  that we saw exposed by the Twitter files. Remember, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2388.6s)]
*  Can I bring up something maybe tangential and you can react to this? Just speaking of kind of like [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2391.8s)]
*  censorship and then just the media complex that we have, I saw today that Trump filed [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2396.84s)]
*  like a 10 or $15 billion lawsuit against the broadcast networks. Maybe this is old news, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2405.4s)]
*  and maybe I just saw the news. I saw our headline go by on X. I don't understand what it is. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2411.48s)]
*  And then separately with Bobby Kennedy's nomination to HHS, one of the things that he [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2417.8s)]
*  has said that he wants to put an end to is the advertising that [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2423.56s)]
*  pharma does on these broadcast stations. If you put these two things together where you [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2429.4s)]
*  deprive these folks of their largest revenue source, and at the same time, they have to [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2433.24s)]
*  sort of like answer for censorship or manipulating content, do you think that that changes the [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2439.0s)]
*  landscape of how all these companies behave in the future? Or how do you think that that plays up? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2446.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, absolutely. So, all right, let's take each one of those. So on the broadcasters, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2452.4399999999996s)]
*  we've talked about this before, the big broadcast networks and their affiliates receive free [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2458.12s)]
*  spectrum licenses from the FCC, and they get some of the most valuable spectrum there is [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2463.56s)]
*  through those licenses in exchange for certain requirements that their broadcasters are in the [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2468.92s)]
*  public interest. Namely, they have to follow a fairness doctrine, which is supposed to mean [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2474.6s)]
*  that you give equal time to both candidates. Well, in the final weeks of this campaign, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2479.4s)]
*  we saw some really egregious abuses. NBC brought on Kamala Harris, but not Donald Trump, for a very [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2483.48s)]
*  favorable segment on Saturday Night Live the week before the election. Separately, you saw 60 Minutes [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2489.8s)]
*  deceptively edit an interview with Kamala Harris where they actually took one of her answers from [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2496.6s)]
*  one question and put it as the answer to another question. I mean, really deceptive. So you have [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2502.84s)]
*  a couple of examples with both CBS and NBC, which were violating the equal time requirement, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2508.2s)]
*  were clearly working on behalf of the Kamala Harris campaign. And when you look at the coverage [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2514.8399999999997s)]
*  itself, this election was the most unequal in terms of favorable coverage. It was something like a 60 [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2521.24s)]
*  point difference. Something like Kamala Harris received 87% favorable coverage and Trump received [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2527.7999999999997s)]
*  something like 85% negative coverage. So there's no way- Who is that according to? Do you know? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2535.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's a report by Brent Bazzell's media watchdog group. It's been around forever and it's been [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2541.08s)]
*  recording this stuff in every election for the last 30 years. In any event, I think that there's [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2548.2799999999997s)]
*  a very strong argument that the broadcasters have not been fair. That's a violation of their [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2553.48s)]
*  license requirements and we should be reevaluating their spectrum, especially because it's not the [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2557.56s)]
*  highest best use of spectrum anyway. The great irony of this though, Sax, is that they have [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2562.52s)]
*  already been demolished. I don't know if you saw, but a bunch of the anchors at CNN are not renewing [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2567.24s)]
*  because their advertising is so far off that, like Chris Wallace, I think was making 8 million a year [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2572.2s)]
*  and 9 million a year. And he just said, I'm going to go do podcasts because I think they lowballed [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2577.64s)]
*  his offer. And if they lose all that advertising from pharma, which I think in some of these [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2581.32s)]
*  networks is a third or a half, and that's all networks, that's from Fox to CNN and every MSNBC, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2587.24s)]
*  everybody combined. If they lose advertising from pharma, it's over. Like those news networks [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2592.28s)]
*  are going to lose half their revenue overnight. That would be a death blow, Jamath, to your question. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2599.96s)]
*  Yeah. Well, let me get back to that. So just on CNN and MSNBC, you're absolutely right that [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2606.6800000000003s)]
*  they're announcing a bunch of layoffs. Their ratings are destroyed. I think they're down, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2611.0800000000004s)]
*  MSNBC ratings are down like 50% since the election. What that tells me is that their own audience- [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2614.76s)]
*  Wait, sorry, since the election? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2620.12s)]
*  Since the election. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2621.64s)]
*  50%? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2622.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And what that tells me is that their captive viewer base, who's been tuning in for years to [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2623.0s)]
*  all of this TDS, has now realized that they were deceived by MSNBC and they've lost credibility, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2628.6s)]
*  even with their most fervent supporters. So there's no question that CNN, MSNBC, they're hurting. Now, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2635.16s)]
*  JCal, just to make one small modification, they do not receive, they do not have spectrum [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2641.4s)]
*  licenses from the FCC because they're cable networks. So they're in a different bucket. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2645.96s)]
*  They don't have to abide by the fairness doctrine that CBS and NBC do, but they have different [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2651.0s)]
*  problems. And to your point about pharma, there's absolutely no reason to be allowing pharma [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2658.12s)]
*  advertisements on these TV networks. The fact of the matter is the people who are viewing, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2663.8s)]
*  those networks can't buy, you can't buy pharmaceuticals without a prescription. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2669.88s)]
*  It's up to doctors to write you the prescription. And this is why most countries, most Western [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2675.24s)]
*  countries prohibit pharma advertising on the networks. And I think Bobby Kennedy has a very [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2680.52s)]
*  strong argument that it would serve the public interest not to allow this. We don't allow [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2686.04s)]
*  advertisements for tobacco, right? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2692.52s)]
*  So I guess the thing that doesn't make sense to me, Sax, is you're such a first [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2695.3999999999996s)]
*  amendment absolutist and free speech absolutist, isn't it? And I'm not saying this is my opinion, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2701.08s)]
*  but my challenge to you would be is tell me about freedom of speech and expression in relation to [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2707.48s)]
*  being able to do advertising for these products. Aren't consumers smart enough to figure it out? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2714.7599999999998s)]
*  The point of the advertising is, I think, is not at the end of the day to influence consumers [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2720.84s)]
*  because consumers can't buy pharmaceuticals. They have to go to a doctor. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2725.64s)]
*  Well, that's what they say in it. Ask your doctor about this. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2728.2s)]
*  The purpose of the advertising is to buy favorable coverage. That's the point. And there are many [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2732.52s)]
*  examples. Well, there are many examples of people who've worked in these networks saying that they [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2737.56s)]
*  had a story that was negative about pharma companies. And that story got spiked because [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2744.4399999999996s)]
*  the pharma companies are the biggest advertisers. In fact, I think it was, there was a story about [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2748.9199999999996s)]
*  Fox News and who, who, who is the guy, Roger Ailes? [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2754.2s)]
*  Well, there's been a number of stories. I know what you're talking about. There's been stories [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2759.72s)]
*  about Anderson Cooper. Who's the guy who does international coverage on the weekends? GPS is [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2763.24s)]
*  the name of his show. I'm drawing, I can't remember right now. Reed's a car. Thank you for [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2770.2799999999997s)]
*  Reed's a car. Yes. I think a bunch of those shows were like literally brought to you by Pfizer, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2774.8399999999997s)]
*  brought to you by these things. And so those shows potentially would just go away. And then [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2780.28s)]
*  there were, there was reporting on the number of times they would report on those companies [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2784.84s)]
*  and it showed they didn't. So what do you think Freeberg of should pharma companies be allowed [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2789.32s)]
*  to advertise to consumers to ask their doctors, to ask them about Viagra? What's your take? [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2794.6000000000004s)]
*  He's thinking for those of you at home listening, he's giving a deep thought. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2803.48s)]
*  Well, he's thinking, Jake, let me just say, I think there is, there is a free speech issue that [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2811.32s)]
*  has to be weighed. Okay. So I don't want to be totally dismissive of that. However, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2815.88s)]
*  I think that the Viagra example is a, is on the like far end of the spectrum of a drug that by, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2819.96s)]
*  you know, by advertising it, you could actually get consumers to request it from their doctor. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2827.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't think most drugs are like that. And I think my contention would be that the real reason [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2831.08s)]
*  they're paying all this massive advertising is not to influence consumers, but to influence the [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2836.92s)]
*  coverage that they get. And there is something very corrupt about that. And I think that Bobby [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2842.04s)]
*  Kennedy has a really strong point that if you were to remove that incentive that many people inside [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2847.4s)]
*  the industry have admitted exists, then you would get much fairer coverage of these pharma companies. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2853.7999999999997s)]
*  And we would actually get to be a healthier country because you wouldn't allow them to [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2859.24s)]
*  basically manipulate the public debate. So that, that's the argument. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2863.7999999999997s)]
*  Freeburg, you want to chime in on it or no? I mean, I feel like there's some market [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2870.7599999999998s)]
*  correction that takes place here, which we're already seeing, which is the consumers are [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2874.3599999999997s)]
*  moving away. We just talked about moving away from cable news, moving away from legacy media. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2880.2s)]
*  They don't trust it. The trust is at an all time low. I don't know if it's necessarily the [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2886.7599999999998s)]
*  government's job to determine who advertises what, where, how, and why. I don't like the government [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2891.7999999999997s)]
*  having that sort of degree of authority, generally speaking, because it can then lead into the [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2898.12s)]
*  government having overreach and oversight to control entities that maybe are competitive with [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2902.3599999999997s)]
*  the government in different ways. I do believe that the beef with big tech is a result of big [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2908.04s)]
*  tech's influence over the population where the government wants to have that degree of influence [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2914.52s)]
*  over the population. So it's actually a battle between government and private entities over who [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2920.2s)]
*  can influence the population and who has the ability to control the narrative. And I think [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2925.72s)]
*  that the general concept that the government should be determining who advertises where, what, how, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2931.08s)]
*  and why is not a great one. And I don't think that consumers are dumb. I think that consumers are [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2935.32s)]
*  showing their proclivity for independent media and independent news sources because they don't [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2940.76s)]
*  trust the influence that's been kind of imparted upon these other channels and these other sources, [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2946.76s)]
*  and they're moving away from it. So I don't know if it's as much kind of a regulatory question and [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2952.2000000000003s)]
*  big pharma needs to be affected. I think that the market to some degree does its job. I don't think [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2956.44s)]
*  the consumers are dumb. I will also just kind of counter one of Sachs' points. I think that there [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2961.48s)]
*  are drugs, like multiple sclerosis is a good example. There was a drug introduced a couple [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2967.24s)]
*  years ago called Okravis and it was a new therapy for multiple sclerosis that is extremely effective. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2972.4399999999996s)]
*  It's a really big step change in biological therapies. And a lot of people that were on MS [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2978.2s)]
*  and have had MS for decades take kind of old school drugs that maybe aren't that effective. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2985.16s)]
*  So to create awareness, and they're not regularly seeing their doctors. They may not go in and see [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2991.4799999999996s)]
*  their doctor every year like they're supposed to. So the pharma companies are creating awareness [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2995.08s)]
*  that there's this new modality and this new product that could help them to get them to go [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=2999.48s)]
*  into the doctor's office. So I don't want to say that these are all like evil, trying to control [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3003.24s)]
*  and influence. There are good drugs that come to market. They are beneficial to people and people [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3009.08s)]
*  don't know about them. How else are they supposed to get that word out if they're not able to [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3012.52s)]
*  advertise? So I don't think that it's all like negative and all malicious kind of behavior and [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3016.2s)]
*  manipulation of media. We all have the resources, we all have the capacity, and we are all likely [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3021.24s)]
*  very frequently going to doctors. Most people don't. And so most people that have chronic disease or [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3027.56s)]
*  have health issues, there has to be a mechanism for making them aware of new options, new [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3033.16s)]
*  alternatives, new products that are coming to market. So I'm not super like putting my foot down [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3039.08s)]
*  saying pharma companies shouldn't be able to advertise, shouldn't be able to buy media out [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3043.16s)]
*  there and put ads up and tell people about stuff that they've discovered or that they've invented. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3046.2s)]
*  That's been regulated, that's been tested, that's been approved, and that works and can help save [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3050.92s)]
*  lives. I think they should have the freedom and ability to do that. So I think there's a bit of [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3054.52s)]
*  a nuance here to how this gets handled, is my point. Yeah, I mean, look, I'm not saying that [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3059.48s)]
*  there's no benefit at all to letting pharma companies advertise some products. I think the [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3065.08s)]
*  question you have to ask is why is so much money going from pharma to these news outlets? Because [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3071.88s)]
*  most of the products that you generally can't buy them. I'll tell you the reason. The reason is that [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3080.2799999999997s)]
*  the pharma companies make so much money off of government funded insurance programs. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3085.4s)]
*  Let me just state that again. If we only had private insurance, or if consumers had to pay [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3089.64s)]
*  for their drugs and their therapies themselves, the cost of drugs would go way down. The reason [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3095.3199999999997s)]
*  the cost of drugs has gone way up is because so much of the government insurance programs don't [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3100.68s)]
*  negotiate drug prices. And there are all these middlemen and all these people that sit in between [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3106.2s)]
*  that have been regulated through regulatory capture into the system that has allowed an [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3111.0s)]
*  incredible inflation in the cost of drug prices. Therefore, there is a lot of money to kind of [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3115.3199999999997s)]
*  continue the capture of the system. I don't think that it is right. And I think that the free market [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3119.56s)]
*  generally, or having a less regulatory captured market, will allow an appropriate kind of pricing [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3124.7599999999998s)]
*  of therapies and appropriate kind of adjustment in the market, which doesn't exist today. So [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3130.8399999999997s)]
*  so much money to kind of keep the market the way it is needs to kind of keep flowing. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3135.24s)]
*  That's my sense of this. I don't think it's about bad drugs need to kind of stay in play [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3140.04s)]
*  as much as it is this market's been allowed to inflate and the cost of health care and the cost [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3144.6s)]
*  of drugs has inflated in a way that's simply untenable. And it doesn't make sense. And I [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3148.6s)]
*  think that it's because of regulatory capture. And I think that that needs to change. And I'm [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3154.12s)]
*  hopeful that it does. That's the second reason then to get the this pharma money out of advertising [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3157.56s)]
*  because you're basically explaining it as like a self looking ice cream cone. But again, there's [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3162.84s)]
*  another reason as well. I think that explains the sheer magnitude, which is its influence buying its [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3167.96s)]
*  influence. To your point, Saxo, that was what it's about to bring up. You know, there are. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3173.6400000000003s)]
*  It's very subtle. You're not going to have somebody at NBC or CNN or Fox come down and tell Tucker [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3180.28s)]
*  Carlson or Rachel Maddow or Anderson Cooper, hey, you can't cover the story. But there is [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3186.2s)]
*  a bunch of self censorship that occurs, I believe, where people just don't select certain stories to [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3192.8399999999997s)]
*  be on the docket. And they just shape the coverage. So they might not say something positive or [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3199.0s)]
*  negative about Pfizer or Johnson and Johnson, whoever it is, they'll just avoid that story. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3204.3599999999997s)]
*  Because these anchors are getting paid, or have been previously paid 10 10 million 25 million a [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3211.0s)]
*  year. Do you think they're going to like, really go hard at Pfizer or somebody like that? No, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3217.48s)]
*  they're just not going to I've been inside the machine. They just avoid those stories. Okay, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3222.84s)]
*  let's keep going through the docket here. I think it was pretty good conversation. I know, by the [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3228.04s)]
*  way, I just wanted to say to the Trump administration, if you want the economy to rip, let M&A rip. But [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3233.64s)]
*  my one caveat is, is a really simple way to do this. If you're under a trillion dollar valuation, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3239.8s)]
*  let those companies buy and sell each other because then we could go from a mag seven to a mag 70. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3245.5600000000004s)]
*  That's where I think actually it makes the most sense if you actually are concerned about the [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3250.84s)]
*  consolidation of power in the top seven, let them sit out acquiring more great companies and let the [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3254.2000000000003s)]
*  people under that who are the mid market cap companies let them do the buying and selling [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3261.48s)]
*  because then you might have a mag eight, nine and 10 show up. That's not talking my book, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3265.4s)]
*  it would be better for me, Friedberg, to let the mag seven participate because they can pay [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3268.92s)]
*  higher prices. They're not price sensitive. But I do think the mid market companies buying and selling [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3273.16s)]
*  would make a healthier environment for competition. So you think it's sorry, you think it creates more [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3278.04s)]
*  competition, which will that'll benefit consumers and grow the economy? Well, look at it this way. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3283.16s)]
*  If somebody wants to buy, let's say Waymo gets spun out, somebody wants to buy it. If Amazon can't [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3288.28s)]
*  buy it, and Tesla can't buy it, and Amazon can't buy it, but they could merge with Uber, Lyft, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3293.48s)]
*  DoorDash, you know, all those mid Airbnb, if those companies could consolidate, can you imagine what [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3302.36s)]
*  would happen if Amazon couldn't buy those companies, but you could see Waymo spin out and then partner [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3307.32s)]
*  with DoorDash and partner with Airbnb and you had that as one company. Now you got a $400 billion [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3314.44s)]
*  company that is nipping on the heels that is aggressively competing with Amazon. That's what [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3320.2s)]
*  you want in the market is more competition for the mag seven. You don't want the magnificent seven to [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3324.9199999999996s)]
*  run away with it. And we could create the eighth, ninth and 10. So just imagine that free bird, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3329.96s)]
*  there was a another trillion dollar company, like I actually, I think Tesla just became a trillion [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3334.68s)]
*  dollar company again. So now that they're up in those ranks, great. Don't let Tesla don't let [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3339.3999999999996s)]
*  Amazon, et cetera, Nvidia buy more companies that those that mergers and acquisitions and that [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3345.16s)]
*  strength happen under the trillion dollar mark. What do you think of that general concept? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3350.44s)]
*  Free bird? Yeah, I generally think competition is good. I generally think free markets should [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3354.92s)]
*  be allowed to operate. And I've shared my point of view. I think bigger is going to drive more [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3359.96s)]
*  innovation than lots of little. So, okay. Again, Waymo wouldn't exist if not for Google plowing [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3364.12s)]
*  billions and billions. And I don't know about you guys. I took Waymo around the city yesterday, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3369.48s)]
*  pretty sick. Like it is legit. I don't go to the city. Yeah. It's pretty legit. And I think that's [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3373.88s)]
*  toxic cesspool. And by the way, I will say my other comment is I think San Francisco has gotten 10x [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3381.8s)]
*  better now that I've been working downtown the last week or two. 10x better from a toxic cesspool [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3388.1200000000003s)]
*  just being a cesspool. I think part of the fact, part of the reason is all of Walgreens is gone. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3394.92s)]
*  There's no Walgreens left. You can't buy deodorant. Problem solved. There's nowhere to do crime anymore. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3399.48s)]
*  How do you do that? You gotta ask Jason. Jason, how do you get an Amazon package delivered? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3408.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't. Hey, man, I'm in Texas. You can do whatever you want here. Jason gets his supplies [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3414.44s)]
*  airdropped in once a month. What are you talking about? I'm bullish on the San Francisco turn [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3421.08s)]
*  around because I think Daniel Lurie getting elected mayor was huge. And this doesn't get [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3425.32s)]
*  really as much attention, but it's very important. The board shifted. The radicals got voted off the [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3430.2000000000003s)]
*  supervisors. So the board of supervisors are less progressive. Daniel's in the mayoral office. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3435.6400000000003s)]
*  It is. And I think the city's already like turning around. I've been super blown away the last couple [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3441.56s)]
*  of weeks. I've been downtown. I'm like, why am I not working downtown every day? It's actually [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3447.0800000000004s)]
*  really nice. It feels like San Francisco 20 years ago. Let's see. I'm pretty bullish. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3450.76s)]
*  I mean, safety is the number one thing. If they can stop the overdose. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3455.2400000000002s)]
*  It needs to get put under control. San Francisco spends one and a half X per capita of what New [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3458.28s)]
*  York City spends. And that's something that Daniel and his team have kind of said they're going to [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3462.2000000000003s)]
*  address sort of like their own doge. And there's a team going in there to address this. So I'm [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3467.4s)]
*  really bullish on what's going to happen with the city. It's just such a great place. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3471.32s)]
*  It seems like the power resides in the supervisors and they seem to have flipped [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3475.5600000000004s)]
*  two or three of the really lunatic ones, right? Sax, they got rid of dopey, Dan Preston. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3479.64s)]
*  Who was the other guy? Peskin. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3484.68s)]
*  Peskin. He was an idiot. And those guys are done. So that's progress. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3486.8399999999997s)]
*  Do you want to talk about the Trump candidates, J. Cal? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3491.56s)]
*  Yeah, let's get to that in a second. But before we get to that, FBI raided the home of poly market [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3494.8399999999997s)]
*  CEO Shane Copeland. He was on the election night stream. He was raided on Wednesday, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3499.3199999999997s)]
*  November 13th, eight days after the election. They say poly market is Bloomberg says poly [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3506.36s)]
*  markets being investigated for allegedly accepting trades from us based users. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3511.24s)]
*  Here's the backstory. In 2022, poly market paid 1.4 million to settle a case with the CFTC [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3515.72s)]
*  for offering option contracts without proper designation. The Commodity Futures Trading [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3522.2s)]
*  Commission also ordered the company to prevent us traders from making bets. They recently said [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3529.16s)]
*  poly market that is that they had taken additional measures to block Americans from trading. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3534.12s)]
*  At the same time, calcium Robin Hood were able to offer presidential prediction markets because [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3538.2799999999997s)]
*  calcium, it seems like they won their lawsuit against the CFTC last month. So that allowed [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3542.68s)]
*  some betting markets to happen. But poly market is still banned from the US because of that [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3549.08s)]
*  settlement in 2022. Here's the poly market claim. They claim the raid was obviously political [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3552.6s)]
*  retribution by the outgoing administration against poly market for providing a market that [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3559.08s)]
*  correctly called the 2024 presidential election and Shane posted on x discouraging that the [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3563.72s)]
*  current administration would seek a last ditch effort to go after companies they deem to be [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3569.7999999999997s)]
*  associated with political opponents. A bunch of conspiracy theories flying around Peter Thiel [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3574.12s)]
*  and founder funds have made an investment into the company and Nate Silver is an advisor. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3579.3199999999997s)]
*  I guess I'll just point out two things. They're much more accurate than Nate Silver. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3585.16s)]
*  Yeah, so how manipulated can it be if they got everything right? [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3591.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's literally the point I was about to make. And I'll just end with this and [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3595.16s)]
*  then give it to you, Sachs for red meat. Americans are not allowed to participate in a lot of [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3600.12s)]
*  different markets. And these kind of actions have been taken many, many, many times, as we all know, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3606.92s)]
*  poker, crypto, real estate, and prediction markets have all had actions like this taken against them. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3612.84s)]
*  And they typically are a ticket to the offices to just his house, just his house, according to [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3617.8s)]
*  the information we have right now, they bust into his house at 6am. And they took his phone. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3624.28s)]
*  By the way, shout out to like, like if you're breaking the law, why wouldn't they? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3629.6400000000003s)]
*  All that TVD offices. Yeah, it's a great, great speculation. And important to note, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3635.8s)]
*  this action came after the election is resolved. So it's obvious the FBI knew [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3641.0s)]
*  that doing this beforehand would be seen as political and doing it after I guess the decision. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3646.8399999999997s)]
*  No, I know what you're saying. I'm adding something else, which is they obviously knew this would be [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3653.16s)]
*  political Sachs. And so they did it after they knew if they did it before, that would be looked [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3657.64s)]
*  like, you know, really bad that the prediction mark that's prediction Trump, Trump win was [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3662.12s)]
*  rated. So they did it after. What do you think, Sachs? What's going on? Okay, I think it's [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3667.96s)]
*  political or not. I guess we don't know what was driving this. It's certainly an extreme action to [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3672.2s)]
*  bust into someone's home at 6am with the FBI and take take your phone. So it's very curious. I think [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3677.7999999999997s)]
*  there's three theories that I've heard that I think could explain this. And I want to just [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3683.56s)]
*  be very clear that there's no proof on any of this is just a speculation. Yes, a speculation. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3688.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. But by the way, just before I get into it, I think Shane Copeland had one of the funniest [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3696.04s)]
*  tweets I've ever seen. New phone who dis? Yeah, new phone who dis? Nick, you should show them. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3699.88s)]
*  I mean, that was like ballsy. The FBI busts in your house, takes your phone, and that's the person [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3705.48s)]
*  you tweet. I think that means that this is probably not a serious situation. But anyway, go ahead. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3709.88s)]
*  Well, who knows? But yeah. Or he's confident is what I would say. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So theory [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3713.88s)]
*  number one is that what the feds are looking for is whether any domestic whales were illegally [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3719.96s)]
*  wagering on the election outcome because theoretically the money is all supposed to [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3728.52s)]
*  be offshore because domestic wagering on the election was illegal. However, a court ruled [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3733.64s)]
*  just days before the election that domestic wagering was legal. So that's a theory. Number one [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3739.4s)]
*  doesn't really make a lot of sense because the FBI would be enforcing a rule or a law that the [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3744.7599999999998s)]
*  courts had just overruled just days before the election. So but that's theory number one. Theory [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3751.08s)]
*  number two, and this theory was raised by Fortune magazine, is that the polymarket was rife with [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3756.12s)]
*  what's called wash trading, which is a form of market manipulation where shares are bought and [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3762.6s)]
*  sold often simultaneously and repeatedly by the same people to create a false impression of volume [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3767.48s)]
*  and activity. This is illegal in the US and it does occur in crypto markets. So they could have [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3773.96s)]
*  been going after that. But again, it does seem like a very extreme thing to bust into his house. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3780.2s)]
*  Why don't you just ask Shane? What authority would the US government have if it's all offshore [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3785.0s)]
*  in that context? I don't know. I'm just laying out possible theories, but Fortune magazine did [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3791.08s)]
*  raise that theory. But again, if that's what your claim is, just subpoena polymarket during business [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3797.16s)]
*  hours, I don't know why you need to raid the guy's home or raid the office. That's where the files [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3802.52s)]
*  are. Right. And now let me lay out theory number three, okay, which is going to be a little bit [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3807.24s)]
*  more controversial. Here we go. But get the chip oil. If somebody was manipulating these sites, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3813.4s)]
*  okay, then on whose behalf were they doing it? And what you'd have to say is that they were [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3821.2400000000002s)]
*  doing it on behalf of the Kamala campaign. Because in the last few days of the election, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3826.92s)]
*  there was a weird blip where polymarket and and calcium, especially calcium, even more than [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3832.6000000000004s)]
*  polymarket, all of a sudden flipped to Kamala. And you can see this particularly in Pennsylvania, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3838.04s)]
*  where all of a sudden there was a big flip at the end away from Trump towards Kamala. That turned [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3844.2s)]
*  out to be totally fake. And Trump won Pennsylvania pretty, pretty handily. And so you got a wonder, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3849.24s)]
*  well, wait a second, was a Kamala supporter maybe trying to push the narrative that there was a [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3855.8s)]
*  last minute surge to Kamala, because that's what the action seemed to imply. And remember that at [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3861.48s)]
*  the same time this was happening, there was a big, there was like a media push to create a narrative [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3868.28s)]
*  by her supporters in the media that there was a late break for Harris, yes, by independence. And so [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3874.76s)]
*  you have to kind of wonder was somebody trying to push the prediction markets at the last minute to [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3881.2400000000002s)]
*  feed a media narrative that they were trying to create? Look, I have no evidence of this whatsoever. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3886.76s)]
*  But the the action in the betting markets and the narrative they're trying to create in the media [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3891.6400000000003s)]
*  do line up. So if somebody was going to investigate election manipulation, this is what they should [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3896.0400000000004s)]
*  look into. Jamal, you have any thoughts here? No, zero thoughts. I mean, yeah, you know, my thoughts [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3901.48s)]
*  on an error. I don't see him ever doing anything risky or illegal. So it makes no sense to me. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3908.44s)]
*  I'm guessing that somebody made him aware pure speculation of something in the system. And that [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3915.3199999999997s)]
*  probably was on his phone. And they probably wanted to get that. And it's probably like a speeding [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3923.3199999999997s)]
*  ticket, ticky, tacky thing. And you just have the law still working its way through the system, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3927.16s)]
*  because they sacks were under an order to not take us. But Cal, she had gotten the mark, the law [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3933.8799999999997s)]
*  changed with their successful lawsuit, or they had defended their their case. So I would say it's [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3940.2s)]
*  all allegedly folks. And so wait for more information is always a good idea. All right, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3945.56s)]
*  Trump is building his team. And it's a long list. We've got, I guess, dozens of names right now. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3952.68s)]
*  So let's start with the four. Who's your favorite, Jacob? Well, my opinion probably doesn't matter [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3960.3599999999997s)]
*  all that much. But let me go with the four that are creating the most buzz to mouth. Let's create [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3966.2s)]
*  the let's go with the four that are having the most buzz. And then I'll let you each tell me what [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3972.2s)]
*  you think is your one candidate you love. The one I Yeah, there is one actually, I love but let's [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3976.68s)]
*  I'll say, but who's that? I'm curious. I'm genuinely curious. The fake and Elon doing [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3982.68s)]
*  Doge is my absolute favorite. Yes. Anything else that I am fascinated by Bobby Kennedy, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3988.04s)]
*  going in and trying to make the country healthier. And the country is the most sick country, I think, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=3997.4s)]
*  of all of the Western countries. And I think our food system has massive problems. So I'm very [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4004.2s)]
*  excited to see what he does inside of the Health and Human Services Department. I think it's a [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4009.32s)]
*  little bit controversial, obviously, but I don't see how it could be any worse than what we currently [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4015.48s)]
*  have. How do you feel about that? Who's your favorite? I guess we can just go with people's [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4020.76s)]
*  favorites if you want to go that way. The way I interpret his cabinet picks is that he's creating [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4026.04s)]
*  a coalition. So I view it more as like a package deal, J Cal, I'm not going to pick out one or two, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4030.84s)]
*  although I do have my favorites. The person who I think very astutely understands what Trump is [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4036.36s)]
*  trying to do is Charlie Kirk, who's a major influencer on the Republican side. And he says [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4041.88s)]
*  that what Maha, which is Make America Healthy, again, they get RFK, Bobby Kennedy, HHS, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4049.6400000000003s)]
*  obviously, the libertarians get Tulsi at DNI. I would add to that that they also get Elon of [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4055.4s)]
*  the Vague at Doge. The populace base gets MacGhase, they get Hegseth, at DoD, they get Hohmann. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4061.0s)]
*  And then the peace through projecting strength crowd, which is kind of a nice name for neocon, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4068.12s)]
*  gets Rubio as Secretary of State and Stefanik at the UN. So I think that Trump is basically trying [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4073.24s)]
*  to have his cabinet reflect the diversity of views within the Republican Party. He's not [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4080.2s)]
*  decisively choosing one side over another. What this means is that during his presidency, he's [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4087.4s)]
*  going to get all the views and all the options within the party. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4093.48s)]
*  Okay. So that's the collective view. That's an interesting way of about it. Let's go point [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4096.52s)]
*  by point through the most controversial ones. Matt Gaetz is obviously the most controversial [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4099.88s)]
*  at attorney. They're all young, though. That's what's incredible. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4104.36s)]
*  They are all young. That's another trend, yeah. And he has been put up as attorney general. He [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4105.96s)]
*  has to be confirmed by the Senate, obviously. He's the house rep from Florida. Sax, how qualified is [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4110.92s)]
*  he for this job on a scale of one to 10? I think that Matt Gaetz would be a breath of fresh air [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4115.64s)]
*  at DOJ. I mean, look, here's why is that the DOJ has been involved for the last eight or nine years [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4122.280000000001s)]
*  in a completely fabricated effort to portray Donald Trump as an agent of the Russians. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4129.72s)]
*  It started with the Steele dossier. They then opened an investigation based on that phony [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4136.4400000000005s)]
*  piece of opposition research funded by the Hillary campaign. They lied to the FISA court to spy on [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4141.320000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump's campaign. They then worked with the various intelligence services and with the media [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4146.68s)]
*  to create this hoax that went on for years and years. There's been no accountability for that. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4155.88s)]
*  Furthermore, in the 2020 election, you also had that effort to essentially cover up the [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4161.4800000000005s)]
*  Hunter Biden hard drive that the FBI and DOJ were sitting on that for roughly a year. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4166.360000000001s)]
*  They created a phony story that it was Russian disinformation when it turned out to be completely [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4172.36s)]
*  authentic. So you think there's a lot to clean up there? How qualified is he on a scale of one to 10? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4177.48s)]
*  What the president ran on was that the DOJ needed to be de-weaponized, that it had been turned into [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4182.28s)]
*  a partisan political apparatus for the Democrats. I don't think anyone can argue with that at this [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4192.759999999999s)]
*  point. I think the American people clearly bought into that argument. Now, in order to clean it up, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4197.4s)]
*  you're going to have to bring in a total outsider who's willing to break some eggs and shake things [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4202.2s)]
*  up. Is Matt Gaetz the only person who could do that? No, there are other people who could do it, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4206.759999999999s)]
*  but Matt Gaetz is definitely qualified for that role. He was one of the most outspoken critics [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4210.599999999999s)]
*  in Congress of this weaponization of the FBI. He was never fooled by the Russiagate hoax. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4215.719999999999s)]
*  Most of the establishment was. And anybody who bought into the Russiagate hoax is not qualified [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4220.92s)]
*  to run the DOJ at this point. Okay. Any concerns? Well, there's a bunch of unproven smearers and [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4226.36s)]
*  accusations have been made against him. We'll put it like that. Any other concerns? Excuse me? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4232.5199999999995s)]
*  Aside from the investigations and whatever, and the smears. Well, there's a bunch of unproven [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4239.24s)]
*  smears and accusations have been made against him. And my own view on that is that if there [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4245.08s)]
*  was really something there, I think Merrick Garland's DOJ would have acted on it two or [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4250.5199999999995s)]
*  three years ago. So I personally discount all these smears without there being any evidence [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4254.28s)]
*  whatsoever. And I think it's very predictable that what we're seeing with both Matt Gaetz and with [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4260.36s)]
*  Tulsi is that the worst accusations get made without any evidence in the media when the blob [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4264.84s)]
*  or the establishment wants to stop a true populist reformer from cleaning up their backyard. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4272.04s)]
*  Freberg, your thoughts on Matt Gaetz? And that seems to be the most controversial one. Any [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4277.639999999999s)]
*  concerns? You think he's the most suited guy for the job? I don't want to comment on Matt Gaetz, [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4281.24s)]
*  but I'd like to talk about. Why not? Because I'd like to talk about a broader point of view on it. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4286.44s)]
*  Okay. So I think [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4293.4s)]
*  there's this kind of thing that happens in biology called evolution. And a lot of people [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4298.44s)]
*  think evolution is this continuous process, but it's not evolution is this process by which there [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4304.5199999999995s)]
*  is some significant growth for a period of time. And then there is an extinction event or an [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4309.96s)]
*  external force that causes what ultimately becomes what's called punctuated equilibrium. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4316.44s)]
*  So the whole kind of system resets and then the healthier, stronger species [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4321.4800000000005s)]
*  survive and they grow and they persist. And if you look at the first chart, Nick, that I pulled up, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4326.12s)]
*  this will just show you guys past extinction events, large amounts of biomass over the past [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4332.6s)]
*  half billion years get wiped out when these extinction events occur. And then evolution [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4338.52s)]
*  occurs because the species that can survive the extinction of him persists in the environment [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4343.400000000001s)]
*  and they grow. And that's how evolution kind of actually takes place. If there's an external force [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4348.200000000001s)]
*  that changes what survives and what doesn't, it's kind of a testing force. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4354.200000000001s)]
*  If you look at federal spending, then this is a crazy link, but here's federal spending [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4358.120000000001s)]
*  over the last couple of decades. And I would argue that many of the agencies, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4362.84s)]
*  much of the bureaucracy, many of the jobs created, many of the spending programs, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4369.400000000001s)]
*  many of the operating models, many of the behaviors can kind of be viewed as a species or species [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4373.64s)]
*  within this ecosystem that have kind of grown a lot over the last few decades. And I think what [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4380.12s)]
*  Trump's mandate was by the people and people don't want to hear this and they don't like it, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4385.4800000000005s)]
*  but his mandate was to be kind of the extinction event. And whatever agencies, whatever operating [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4390.52s)]
*  processes, whatever individuals, whatever bureaucratic systems exist within the federal [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4397.240000000001s)]
*  government that can withstand the scrutiny of the individuals that Trump is going to put in charge [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4402.4400000000005s)]
*  of each of these agencies, that they can survive and they can come out the other end. There is [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4407.400000000001s)]
*  certainly some degree of strength and resilience and hardiness. This is not about right or wrong. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4412.6s)]
*  You say they deserve to exist if they can survive. I'm saying this is going to bring in the most [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4418.04s)]
*  disruptive force that federal agencies have ever seen. And the intention with Trump isn't to find [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4422.44s)]
*  some person to keep running things the way they have been run in the past. His mandate from the [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4428.28s)]
*  people who elected him based on the message he put out there is to do the opposite, which is to go in [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4433.32s)]
*  and be as disruptive and damaging and destructive as possible. And whatever comes out the other side [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4437.72s)]
*  will be stronger, will be hardier, and theoretically will be more resilient. And I think that that's the [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4442.84s)]
*  event that's underway. Now, the people who are getting exactly what they want in Trump's [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4451.96s)]
*  candidacies are the Democrats. They were saying Trump is going to put a bunch of crazy lunatics [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4457.56s)]
*  in office and he's going to make them the cabinet. And now they're able to kind of clap their hands [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4462.4400000000005s)]
*  and say, we told you so, we told you so. And I'm not sure that if they're really getting the message, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4466.76s)]
*  which is that the intention here isn't to keep things running the way they have been running, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4471.8s)]
*  but to really fundamentally test the systems and test the systems with the most challenging [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4476.28s)]
*  oppositional forces the systems have ever been tested by, which is the candidates or the [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4481.56s)]
*  individuals that he's putting in charge of each of these agencies. So I'm not saying it's right or [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4485.56s)]
*  wrong one way or the other, but I'm making an observation that this is going to be kind of an [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4490.04s)]
*  extinction level event that Trump's decisions on who he's putting in place, I think, are going to [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4493.88s)]
*  drive an outcome on the other end that's going to make the government look very different. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4498.44s)]
*  And I'm not going to sit around and say this person's good, this person's bad, because I [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4503.48s)]
*  don't think the point is to find someone that's quote qualified to do the job. The intention is [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4506.679999999999s)]
*  actually quite different and the outcome may actually be positive for America. If you fast [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4511.16s)]
*  forward a couple of years in some cases, and there's some cases where things can get really [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4515.639999999999s)]
*  messed up and people can suffer and jobs will be lost and all sorts of bad things will happen, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4518.919999999999s)]
*  but we cannot continue the way we have to with respect to federal spending, with respect to [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4523.4800000000005s)]
*  federal spending, bureaucracy and inefficiency in the federal government. And so something has [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4528.68s)]
*  to happen. And if this is the path by which this gets resolved in the limited window that's in [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4533.16s)]
*  front of this particular administration, which is probably two years, maybe four, maybe this is what [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4537.8s)]
*  has to happen. Shabath, where do you stand on Freeberg's interesting metaphor here that [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4542.84s)]
*  we're sending meteors into each of these departments to blow them up and see if they [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4549.8s)]
*  survive an extinction level event? I saw you nodding. Do you think this is an interesting [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4554.2s)]
*  framing? Great take. I have nothing to add to Freeberg's take. Got it. Who's your favorite? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4559.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. You asked me the question I answered. Who's your favorite? Well, I think let's take Elon and [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4564.76s)]
*  Vivek off the table because that's an obvious one that we've all been behind since the beginning. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4569.64s)]
*  Yeah. And we know, and we all support the idea who's not against more efficiency. I mean, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4574.28s)]
*  you have to be an idiot to be against efficiency. It's the easiest one to say you love. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4578.44s)]
*  I think the highest beta pick so far has been Bobby Kennedy. I think the second highest beta pick [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4582.44s)]
*  is Matt Gaetz. Explain highest beta pick in this context, please. The third is Tulsi Gabbard. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4588.5199999999995s)]
*  That there is the potential for an enormously positive two or three sigma outcome, but there's [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4596.839999999999s)]
*  also the chance that it can really not work. That was exactly why I picked Bobby Kennedy, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4603.8s)]
*  because he's going to shake it up. Right. Peter Thiel just did this podcast with Barry Weiss. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4611.4800000000005s)]
*  It was fantastic, by the way. Highly recommend. Highly recommend. He's awesome. Yeah. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4615.64s)]
*  One of the great things he said is that he was talking about science, but I think the example [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4621.8s)]
*  works here as well, which is that we didn't have enough skepticism and we had too much dogma. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4625.56s)]
*  He was talking about the death of science. I think that that idea applies here as well, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4631.320000000001s)]
*  which is that the federal bureaucracy has not really been challenged. Vivek put out a very [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4638.52s)]
*  compelling post on X where he basically said, on the one hand, there's going to be radical [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4646.4400000000005s)]
*  transparency, but on the other hand, there's a lot of case law that we can use to try to [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4653.16s)]
*  really dismantle the government apparatus. They're putting themselves on a shot clock to do it by [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4659.08s)]
*  2026 for the 250th anniversary. I think I'm really predisposed to this idea that [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4665.8s)]
*  it'll force the government to be very resilient at the end of this process. I think that's a good [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4676.6s)]
*  thing. It'll probably be very different than what it is on the way in. I think that that can be very [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4680.68s)]
*  positive. All right. So we got your mouth and myself actually giving some specific names that [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4686.2s)]
*  we thought were interesting. I'll go back to you, Sax. Maybe I'll phrase it as to Chimath's phrasing. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4692.04s)]
*  Which one do you think has the greatest chance of creating a massive potential change that could [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4698.84s)]
*  be positive, but also has some possibility of a destructive downside? In other words, it could go [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4703.88s)]
*  either way, but man, if it goes the right way, it could be brilliant and amazing and great for all [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4709.32s)]
*  Americans. Who would be your number one, number two in that regard? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4713.96s)]
*  Well, you have to identify what the potential downside is. I think the single biggest risk [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4717.32s)]
*  in a second Trump term is that somehow the United States gets into an unnecessary war, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4722.4400000000005s)]
*  a war that we don't need, another forever war. It's certainly not what President Trump wants. He's [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4727.56s)]
*  been abundantly clear on the campaign trail that he wants to avoid wars. He wants to avoid World War [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4732.28s)]
*  Three. It's clearly where all of his instincts are. But the fact of the matter is we have a very [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4738.6s)]
*  fraught and difficult international situation right now. The Middle East is on fire. We have [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4742.92s)]
*  a proxy war going on with Russia. There is the chance that things could always spiral out of [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4747.0s)]
*  control. You need, I think within the cabinet, not just hawkish voices, but also dovish voices [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4752.92s)]
*  so that the president has the full range of options at his disposal. In that sense, I would [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4759.24s)]
*  say that Tulsi is being one of the more dovish voices is incredibly critical just to balance [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4765.32s)]
*  out some of the other voices who are more hawkish. And so in that sense, I think just making sure [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4772.2s)]
*  that the president gets to hear from a wide spectrum of views, I think that part's very [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4778.2s)]
*  important. So that would be Tulsi. Tulsi would be your pick for- [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4783.88s)]
*  Yeah. Just because Tulsi could literally make the difference between whether we get in a [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4788.12s)]
*  unnecessary forever war or not. I would also just say that with respect to the other picks, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4792.5199999999995s)]
*  there's obviously a lot of hysteria going on, a lot of hyperbole about the downsides. I don't [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4799.080000000001s)]
*  think it's going to be like a meteor hitting the earth. I don't think it's that destructive. I [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4804.92s)]
*  think that it's more like will some eggs be broken up to make an omelet, right? That's the analogy I [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4809.4800000000005s)]
*  would use rather than the meteor. And the thing I would just say is that we all agree the United [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4816.200000000001s)]
*  States is currently on an unsustainable fiscal path. We know that we're spending too much money. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4821.72s)]
*  We know that the bureaucracy is too big. What's the downside of shaking it up? There's just way [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4826.84s)]
*  more upside than downside in terms of shaking up this bureaucracy. Because the current path is [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4830.92s)]
*  bankruptcy. Exactly. So why do we have to act like that it's so risky to bring in outsiders and [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4836.360000000001s)]
*  populists and reformers into these agencies? We know there's going to be huge resistance to them. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4843.96s)]
*  The biggest risk, frankly, is inertia taking over and the reformers aren't able to do enough. And [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4849.72s)]
*  we all do. And that thing is not an option. Yeah. And then we go bankrupt. That's the big risk. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4856.12s)]
*  Why is Tulsi getting attacked? What's the rushing connection? People are saying like, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4860.44s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know any of the history here. So tell me. It's obvious. It's because [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4866.12s)]
*  Washington is a very hawkish place. It's basically run by the war machine. There's no money going to [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4869.96s)]
*  Washington to lobby for peace. All the money in Washington is coming from the military industrial [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4876.92s)]
*  complex. So by definition, it's extremely hawkish and it's geared towards war. And Tulsi- [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4882.28s)]
*  Is there some history with Tulsi and Russia? Yeah. Just to finish my point. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4887.96s)]
*  Yeah. Tulsi has been one of the few consistent voices advocating for peace. So of course, [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4891.88s)]
*  the establishment wants to basically get her nomination vetoed. But again, I think you have [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4897.32s)]
*  to see the cabinet as a package deal. I think it's very important to have Tulsi as one voice [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4903.0s)]
*  for peace within a larger cabinet that already has many hawkish voices. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4908.68s)]
*  Got it. Okay. All right, everybody for your Sultan of Science from Ohalo, David Freeberg, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4912.280000000001s)]
*  the chairman dictator Chamath Palihapitiya from 8090 and David Sachs from Craft Ventures. I am [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4918.52s)]
*  Jason Calacanis, your host here at the All In Podcast and This Week in Startups. We'll see you [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CBMlzHo0AU&t=4926.52s)]
