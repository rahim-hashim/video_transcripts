*  Well, listen, I just wanna say. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=85.68s)]
*  You can make it through this pod. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=88.3s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=89.14s)]
*  I'm a professional. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=89.96s)]
*  With me again today, the king of beep. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=90.8s)]
*  Can't say what he's working on. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=93.97999999999999s)]
*  It's a crop. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=95.78s)]
*  I don't think people understand that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=96.61999999999999s)]
*  Like what the beep, there were so many [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=98.1s)]
*  fucking beeps last time that people couldn't even [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  understand it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=101.94s)]
*  We did beep the beep out of the shoe. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=102.78s)]
*  It was crazy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=103.6s)]
*  It's a crop because he's genetically engineering, right? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=104.78s)]
*  But it's top secret. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=107.61999999999999s)]
*  Which one is gonna do it? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=109.13999999999999s)]
*  They already figured it out in the comments, by the way. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=110.97999999999999s)]
*  Oh yeah, the comments just figured everything out. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=113.5s)]
*  I don't know what's so secret. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=115.1s)]
*  They already figured it out. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=116.78s)]
*  So can we say what it is? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  Go horse it out of the barn, Freeberg. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=119.38s)]
*  Can we get through introductions? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=120.82s)]
*  Go ahead, keep going. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=122.38s)]
*  And chairman dictator Chamath Palaihappitya is with us. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=123.22s)]
*  Welcome back to the program. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=127.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=129.3s)]
*  By the way, I was feeling pretty bad [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=130.24s)]
*  about your sore throat. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=132.96s)]
*  So I went on Google and I found something [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=134.1s)]
*  that may be the cause of it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=140.18s)]
*  Nick, can you just throw up this article? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=141.4s)]
*  Pre-strike. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=143.06s)]
*  You can't pre-strike. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=144.22s)]
*  Let him land the joke, come on. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=146.46s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=148.34s)]
*  This isn't a Tom Cruise movie, you can't pre-strike. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=149.34s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=151.58s)]
*  I found an article that may be the source of your sore throat. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  Oh God. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=156.78s)]
*  Just go. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=157.62s)]

*  Go. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=160.14000000000001s)]
*  Go. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=160.96s)]
*  Go. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=161.8s)]
*  Go. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  Go. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  Go. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=164.3s)]
*  Go. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=165.14000000000001s)]
*  Go. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=165.98000000000002s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=166.8s)]
*  Oh, we're all gonna get canceled. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=167.64000000000001s)]
*  I am your BIPOC chairman. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=168.98s)]
*  And I'm here to do the best job I can serving. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=171.98s)]
*  What do you mean BIPOC chairman? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=174.7s)]
*  Explain to the audience what these two words mean. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=176.54s)]
*  Person of color, bro. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=178.22s)]
*  Billionaire, person of color. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=179.62s)]
*  Oh, is that what it is? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=181.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  So according to D, we just have to say [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=183.42s)]
*  that the number of people that are in the audience [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  is the number of people that are in the audience. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=188.12s)]
*  And then we have the number of people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=189.88s)]
*  that are in the audience. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  So we need to find out what the number of people [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  that are in the audience is. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  So I'm going to go ahead and show you [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=195.66s)]
*  what the number of people in the audience is. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=196.73999999999998s)]
*  We checked the DEI manifesto and it said [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=198.82s)]
*  we needed to make a chairman of the organization. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=201.94s)]
*  So Sachs is leading the all in DEI group [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=204.85999999999999s)]
*  and they voted Chamath to be the first chairman [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=208.88s)]
*  of all in as we get our CEO ready to come on board. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=211.7s)]
*  And so you did a diversity token candidate, Sachs. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  Explain the process. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=217.73999999999998s)]
*  Well, it's more like, you know, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=219.18s)]
*  Chamath was getting a little bit touchy [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=221.66s)]
*  about being called dictator all the time. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=223.01999999999998s)]
*  And you were kind of playing the Biden role [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=225.28s)]
*  of needlessly offending him. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=227.04s)]
*  He's kind of playing the Xi Jinping role. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=228.1s)]
*  So we've elected him chairman [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=229.62s)]
*  so that you can stop calling him dictator. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=232.34s)]
*  Right, because you want to soften it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=234.74s)]
*  We got to be more diplomatic, more sensitive. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=235.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's great. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=237.74s)]
*  I'm all about the diplomatic. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  Listen, he's- [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=239.66s)]
*  There was a Politburo, there was a process, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=240.5s)]
*  it was meritocratic. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=242.82s)]
*  The chairman was elected. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=244.42s)]
*  So smoke came from the chimney and now for year one. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=245.26s)]
*  There's a Politburo consisting of me, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=248.54s)]
*  Freeberg and Chamath. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=250.14s)]
*  And the Politburo has selected Chamath as chairman. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=251.38s)]
*  Get to work, get to work. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=255.5s)]
*  Let's make my 25% worth a billion dollars, please. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=256.74s)]
*  And of course with us, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=261.3s)]
*  hot off his hosting of the absolute best party of the season. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=263.02s)]
*  Well, top two. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=268.68s)]
*  You're a distant two, man. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=269.52s)]
*  It was a top meat protein party. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=271.3s)]
*  Chamath and I went to Sax's. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=274.1s)]
*  I hope you got enough food. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=275.94s)]
*  I did. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=277.22s)]
*  It was good. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=278.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean- [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=278.88s)]
*  That dessert table was crazy. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=279.72s)]
*  No, the dessert table I had to- [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=280.56s)]
*  Out of control. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=282.18s)]
*  I found myself beside it and I was like, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=283.02s)]
*  why am I near this dessert table [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=284.38s)]
*  after the fiasco at Freeberg's? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=285.86s)]
*  So I had to go to the other side. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=287.7s)]
*  Well, here's what Chamath and I did. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=290.58000000000004s)]
*  We got in there and we sniffed out the caviar. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=291.78000000000003s)]
*  And this was top shelf caviar on potato chips. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=295.5s)]
*  That was good. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=298.62s)]
*  Crème fraiche and also on bolognese. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=299.46000000000004s)]
*  On bolognese. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=301.94s)]
*  We parked it there. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  And then- [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=303.6s)]
*  Thumb Pringles. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=304.44s)]
*  That actually is a great way to, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=305.26s)]
*  you know, those blinis are too like bready. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=306.74s)]
*  I don't think it's a good combination with caviar, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=309.3s)]
*  but on a Pringles chip. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=311.54s)]
*  Same word about your caviar. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=313.54s)]
*  High and low. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=314.90000000000003s)]
*  They call it high and low in the business. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=315.74s)]
*  Yeah, you have a high and low. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=317.26s)]
*  Caviar should always be served on Pringles. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=318.1s)]
*  The most important thing, Nick, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=319.14s)]
*  I'm sure you have it queued up, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=320.5s)]
*  is our annual awkward hug. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=322.1s)]
*  This is a tradition amongst the all-in every year [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=324.04s)]
*  to celebrate the holiday seasons. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=327.1s)]
*  We engage in the awkward all-in hug. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=328.74s)]
*  Let me explain how the hug went down. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=332.54s)]
*  We're at the caviar and Chamath is on his eighth Pringle. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=334.76s)]
*  I'm about 15 in. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=339.82s)]
*  I've eaten half the tin of caviar at this point. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=341.1s)]
*  I'm getting my money's worth. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=342.90000000000003s)]
*  I'm coming all the way up to the city. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=345.7s)]
*  I'm risking my life. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=347.26s)]
*  And then here it is. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  We got to break this down. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=348.92s)]
*  First, Chamath is in a loving embrace with Sax. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=350.34s)]
*  What you see there from Sax is not a cry of joy. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=354.65999999999997s)]
*  It's absolute fear. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=357.98s)]
*  Abject fear. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=361.7s)]
*  Chamath's not gonna let go. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=363.82s)]
*  Chamath refused to let go. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=365.78s)]
*  It went on for a while. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=367.94s)]
*  That's what you guys don't understand. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=369.02s)]
*  Because if you look at the studies [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=370.62s)]
*  and Friedberg can attest to this, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=373.06s)]
*  when men hug for two minutes, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=375.06s)]
*  there's a release of oxytocin [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=377.58s)]
*  and it's an incredible anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=379.34s)]
*  So I was giving you therapy. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=382.98s)]
*  That's like the therapeutic hug. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=385.86s)]
*  It's a gift. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=387.54s)]
*  That was your Christmas gift. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=388.38s)]
*  Sax, tell us what you're feeling here. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=389.66s)]
*  We see this blood curdling scream and or cry of joy. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=391.5s)]
*  What was going through your mind [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=395.98s)]
*  when you got to minute two of the hug? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=397.62s)]
*  Take us to the moment. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=400.16s)]
*  I'll show you what I was thinking of here. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=401.0s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=402.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=403.41999999999996s)]
*  Because you can see here, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=404.26s)]
*  also if we break this down, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=405.08s)]
*  Friedberg comes in with an Asperger's side hug. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=407.53999999999996s)]
*  I don't know if you can see that there in the photo. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=409.74s)]
*  But let's see the, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=411.85999999999996s)]
*  because you know, he, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=412.78s)]
*  yeah, you gotta zoom over to the left. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=414.14s)]
*  Friedberg looking at his shoes is like, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=415.82s)]
*  I'm going to express joy and love with my three besties [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=417.62s)]
*  through a man hug. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=421.5s)]
*  And he gets enough of the shoulder in there [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=423.21999999999997s)]
*  that he doesn't have to have full frontal. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=426.94s)]
*  He's technically part of the hug, but he's not really. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=428.78s)]
*  Cannot make eye contact. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=431.34s)]
*  And he says, I have to. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  Now me, I'm like, this is hilarious. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=434.09999999999997s)]
*  So I just jump and I grab all three guys. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=436.97999999999996s)]
*  And I just said, that's just me, pure joy. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=439.02s)]
*  Hilarious. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=441.7s)]
*  Friendship is great. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=442.53999999999996s)]
*  Good to have good friends. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=443.53999999999996s)]
*  Friendship is great. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=444.53999999999996s)]
*  I love you guys. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=445.52s)]
*  I love you guys too. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=446.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=447.29999999999995s)]
*  Back at you. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=448.2s)]
*  This is what I was thinking. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=449.03999999999996s)]
*  This is what it reminded me of. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=450.21999999999997s)]
*  This is Sax's personal Vietnam. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=451.47999999999996s)]
*  This is. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=453.14s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=453.97999999999996s)]
*  It's a great scene. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=454.79999999999995s)]
*  Great scene. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=455.64s)]
*  It's a great scene. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=456.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, that's a great scene. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=457.29999999999995s)]
*  What kind of scene is that? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=458.14s)]
*  Explain. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=458.97999999999996s)]
*  From Fight Club. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=459.82s)]
*  Meatloaf, right? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=460.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=461.5s)]
*  Yeah, Meatloaf. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=462.32000000000005s)]
*  A great scene. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=463.16s)]

*  into his man boobs. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=469.66s)]
*  It's a great scene. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=470.98s)]
*  We're men. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=471.82000000000005s)]
*  Men is what we are. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=472.66s)]
*  Let's get to work. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=474.14000000000004s)]
*  We got a full docket here. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=474.98s)]
*  And the world continues to spin into chaos, apparently. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=476.02000000000004s)]
*  Members of the HOOTY movement [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=481.42s)]
*  have been attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=484.14000000000004s)]
*  with drones and with missiles. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=487.06s)]
*  This is largely under-reported in the mainstream press, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=489.66s)]
*  so we thought we would tackle it here. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=492.74s)]

*  We can link this back because the attacks [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=528.52s)]

*  thousands of extra miles, from what I understand, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=546.38s)]

*  and if this becomes acute, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=552.1s)]

*  You understand what's going on there better than anybody. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=646.16s)]
*  Ryan, obviously, runs Flexport, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=649.54s)]
*  and he is in the business of shipping containers. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=651.5s)]
*  So, Sax, you wanna ask him for some help? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=653.9399999999999s)]
*  What is the impact on global trade here [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=655.74s)]
*  from what's happening in the Red Sea? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=657.82s)]
*  Well, it's massive. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=662.36s)]
*  About 30% of all ocean container traffic flows through the, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=663.62s)]
*  flows through the Suez and through the Red Sea. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=667.86s)]
*  Most of that is going Asia to Europe. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=671.0600000000001s)]
*  So, like, the biggest impact here is gonna be felt [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=672.78s)]
*  on those two areas. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=675.1s)]
*  It's gonna make Chinese manufacturing [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=676.08s)]
*  that much more challenging. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=677.5600000000001s)]
*  You have to go around the southern tip of Africa. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=679.1s)]
*  It's adding about 20%. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=682.46s)]
*  20 to 25% longer journey. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=685.18s)]
*  And now in a network business, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=688.06s)]
*  a longer journey means less capacity. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=690.14s)]
*  So, you're talking about a 20, 25% cut in shipping capacity [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=693.06s)]
*  on the 30% of all containers. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=696.22s)]
*  So, that's containers. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=698.9s)]
*  I also understand that about 12% of global oil goes through [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=699.8s)]
*  and about 8% of liquefied natural gas. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=703.38s)]
*  And just to explain what we're talking about there, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=706.38s)]
*  can we zoom in? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=707.9s)]
*  There's a very narrow strait there [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=708.8s)]
*  called the Bab el Mandeb Strait. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=709.9s)]
*  I hope I didn't massacre that pronunciation. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=711.9s)]
*  So, you go around the Gulf of Aden [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=714.1s)]
*  through that Bab el Mandeb Strait into the Red Sea. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=715.66s)]
*  And then from there, you can go through the Suez Canal [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=719.4200000000001s)]
*  and the Mediterranean. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=722.34s)]
*  Yeah, and so it's a maritime choke point. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=723.22s)]
*  By the way, this is going back. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=724.7s)]
*  It always has been. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=726.02s)]
*  You know, there's documentation. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=727.58s)]
*  Caesar Augustus invaded Yemen in like 63 B, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=729.0600000000001s)]
*  I forget, 63 AD. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=733.22s)]
*  No, I forgot the dates. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=734.5s)]
*  But it was during the reign of Caesar Augustus. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=735.38s)]
*  So, it would have been right around [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=737.5s)]
*  the birth of Jesus Christ. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=739.98s)]
*  And you're talking about thousands of years [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=741.78s)]
*  of this being a really important choke point. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=743.64s)]
*  Even the Egyptians actually built a canal. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=745.4s)]
*  The ancient Egyptians had a canal [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=747.84s)]
*  that connected the Nile River. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=749.1999999999999s)]
*  So, this has always been the place to connect east and west, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=750.3199999999999s)]
*  an incredibly important maritime choke point. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=753.4s)]
*  And the rebel forces in Yemen [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=755.1999999999999s)]
*  have been firing missiles at ships. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=758.6s)]
*  And what that does is spike the insurance costs. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=761.72s)]
*  Obviously, it puts the crew's lives in danger, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=764.18s)]
*  which they can't tolerate. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=768.04s)]
*  But it also really spikes the insurance costs. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=768.96s)]
*  If you sail a ship into a region [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=771.52s)]
*  that's got missiles being fired, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=773.9s)]
*  the insurers just won't cover it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=775.02s)]
*  And so, you can't operate a ship without insurance, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=776.74s)]
*  because if it sinks, you go out, you will bankrupt. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=778.96s)]
*  And so, they're just taking the long way around, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=781.42s)]
*  which as I said, is a 20% reduction in capacity. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=785.62s)]
*  What we've seen, remember with COVID, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=789.06s)]
*  you had all those ships off the port. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=790.78s)]
*  You guys brought me onto the show. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=792.06s)]
*  The last time, I think, was when that happened. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=794.42s)]
*  That was about a 20% reduction in capacity. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=796.5s)]
*  But at the same, what happened during COVID [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=799.5s)]
*  was there was also a 20% increase in demand. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=801.42s)]
*  So this time, there's not an increase in demand. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=804.5799999999999s)]
*  So I don't think it's as impactful as what we saw [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=806.5799999999999s)]
*  to shipping prices during COVID, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=809.06s)]
*  where you had like a 10X run up in price. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=810.62s)]
*  But you're already seeing, prices are coming out now [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=813.12s)]
*  for January freight, for ocean freight, Asia to Europe. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=815.3s)]
*  You're seeing about a 3X increase [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=818.14s)]
*  in the price of ocean freight, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=819.6999999999999s)]
*  versus where we were a month or two ago, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=821.5s)]
*  which was very, very cheap a month or two ago. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=824.2199999999999s)]
*  So I wouldn't read too much into this. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=826.4599999999999s)]
*  And frankly, the Suez Canal is too valuable, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=828.58s)]
*  in my opinion, too valuable to civilization, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=831.94s)]
*  to the modern world, to believe that a group of rebels, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=835.58s)]
*  no matter how well-funded they may be, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=839.94s)]
*  is gonna be able to disrupt that [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=842.5s)]
*  for any long period of time. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=843.86s)]
*  I think there's too many interests aligned here to say, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=845.3000000000001s)]
*  to keep this thing flowing. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=848.14s)]
*  Well, okay, two points on that. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=850.1s)]
*  So we call them a rebel group, and I guess they are. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=851.4200000000001s)]
*  It's a Shia group in Yemen that rose up in 2014 [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=855.38s)]
*  and deposed the monarch there. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=859.82s)]
*  And they basically control large swaths of the country, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=861.5400000000001s)]
*  but they're not internationally recognized. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=864.7s)]
*  So that's why they're called rebels. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=866.34s)]
*  But make no mistake, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=867.38s)]
*  they basically control the vast majority of Yemen. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=868.22s)]
*  It's a Shia group. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=871.48s)]
*  They're, you could say, sponsored by Iran, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=872.38s)]
*  but I'm not sure they're controlled by Iran. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=875.02s)]
*  People call them proxies, and that's true to some degree, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=877.22s)]
*  but they also have agency. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=879.74s)]
*  Like you said, J Cal, they are doing this, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=881.32s)]
*  they say, in solidarity with the Palestinians. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=884.84s)]
*  When the invasion of Gaza first began, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=888.64s)]
*  they were firing rockets at Israel, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=891.1s)]
*  but they had to go all the way over Saudi Arabia. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=893.76s)]
*  They didn't make it. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=895.6800000000001s)]
*  So now they've started firing on ships [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=896.52s)]
*  that are going through the strait. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=898.48s)]
*  They started mining the strait. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=900.52s)]
*  And so like Ryan's saying, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=902.44s)]
*  this has basically put a damper on commerce. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=903.9200000000001s)]
*  Unless you're a country that the hooties like. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=907.6s)]
*  Apparently Russia's been able to move its ships through still. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=910.64s)]
*  They claim they're only targeting ships [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=915.36s)]
*  that are transacting with Israel, but that's not true. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=917.08s)]
*  I mean, a lot of ships have been targeted [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=919.16s)]
*  that don't have a relationship with Israel. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=921.84s)]
*  So let's just say, broadly speaking, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=923.64s)]
*  for Western ships, they can't get through. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=925.58s)]
*  Now what the U.S. has done in response to Ryan's point [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=928.0400000000001s)]
*  is that we've announced this Operation Prosperity Guardian, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=930.76s)]
*  which is to restore the flow of trade through the Red Sea. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=935.0400000000001s)]
*  But the question is what that's gonna involve. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=939.08s)]
*  And I think we are bracing now [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=940.96s)]
*  for the U.S. to start taking military action [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=942.76s)]
*  against the hooties. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=947.28s)]
*  The problem is, I think Ryan, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=948.64s)]
*  when you're saying this is gonna be resolved maybe quickly, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=950.66s)]
*  is that the U.S. was already backing the Saudis [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=953.24s)]
*  in a war against the hooties that started in 2015. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=957.9s)]
*  It only got sort of resolved with a ceasefire [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=961.4s)]
*  that's still pretty fragile last year. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=964.96s)]
*  And so the hooties have already survived [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=966.8s)]
*  almost a decade of Western sponsored attacks on them. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=969.24s)]
*  It's not clear what we have to do [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=972.04s)]
*  to basically stop them from taking these actions. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=974.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think if the U.S. starts a war basically [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=977.3s)]
*  against the hooties in Yemen, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=980.9599999999999s)]
*  we're talking about an expansion of this conflict [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=983.64s)]
*  in the Middle East from beyond what's happening in Gaza [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=985.8399999999999s)]
*  to now another front that directly involves the U.S. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=988.76s)]
*  Moreover, this is, I think, very underreported, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=992.52s)]
*  but there've been almost 80 attacks on U.S. bases [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=996.16s)]
*  in Syria and Iraq by Shia militias, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=999.12s)]
*  again sponsored by Iran, over the last couple of months. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1002.84s)]
*  So this whole region is a powder keg. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1006.08s)]
*  And it's not clear to me that if the U.S. attacks the hooties [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1008.5600000000001s)]
*  that this is gonna lead to a quick resolution. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1013.6s)]
*  So I guess my question back to Ryan is, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1016.0400000000001s)]
*  let's say there is a war here. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1017.8000000000001s)]
*  Let's say the hooties don't stop. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1019.0400000000001s)]
*  I don't think they will. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1020.36s)]
*  And let's say the U.S. gets in a war there, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1021.7s)]
*  but isn't really able to bring it to a decisive conclusion. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1024.96s)]
*  And let's say that this blockade of the Red Sea [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1029.12s)]
*  continues for all of 2024. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1033.8s)]
*  What does that do to global prices? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1037.08s)]
*  Because I think right now the market is pricing in [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1039.8s)]
*  rate cuts next year on the theory that inflation [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1042.52s)]
*  is coming down as a solved problem. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1045.4399999999998s)]
*  It's the right question. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1047.84s)]
*  It'll be a big impact. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1048.6799999999998s)]
*  And if you listen to like retailer earnings calls, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1050.36s)]
*  they're all talking about, hey, we've had six, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1053.6399999999999s)]
*  12 months of deflationary environment. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1055.72s)]
*  Prices are coming down. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1057.32s)]
*  And a lot of what they cite is the lower ocean [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1058.3200000000002s)]
*  freight prices. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1059.68s)]
*  And if that goes back, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1061.0400000000002s)]
*  and if it goes back anywhere near, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1063.76s)]
*  I mean, we're already seeing a 3X, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1065.8000000000002s)]
*  but even that 3X is sort of, well, is this gonna last? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1066.96s)]
*  Do I need to price it all in? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1070.0s)]
*  Do I need to? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1071.28s)]
*  And it hasn't really taken hold of like, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1072.8400000000001s)]
*  that's not a true market dynamic of what is the supply [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1075.44s)]
*  and what is the demand. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1077.8400000000001s)]
*  Freight is very inelastic. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1079.16s)]
*  Like you're gonna ship the product [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1080.44s)]
*  regardless of the price of freight. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1082.16s)]
*  You know, unless your business model has the tiniest [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1084.3200000000002s)]
*  of margins, the price of freight goes up. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1086.54s)]
*  It doesn't impact how many products you ship. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1088.94s)]
*  You're gonna go sell as many products as you can. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1090.7s)]
*  Does it impact America as much as it impacts Europe? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1093.34s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1096.42s)]
*  Now this is the fastest route for many parts of Asia [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1097.86s)]
*  to the East coast of the United States. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1102.42s)]
*  And especially with the Panama canals also congested [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1104.22s)]
*  at the same moment right now. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1106.62s)]
*  Because of, they say it's because of a drought, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1108.42s)]
*  but actually they built a bigger canal [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1110.78s)]
*  and it's just draining the lake faster. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1113.1s)]
*  That's my hypothesis, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1115.5800000000002s)]
*  but I'd like to look into it a little further. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1116.78s)]
*  But the Panama canal is only going [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1118.22s)]
*  at about two thirds capacity. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1120.78s)]
*  So if you're going Asia to the East coast, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1122.42s)]
*  those are your options. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1124.5s)]
*  But to go around the Southern tip of Africa, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1125.76s)]
*  around the Cape of Good Hope to get to the East coast, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1128.7s)]
*  it's like an 8% increase in transit time versus 20 to Europe. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1131.18s)]
*  And there's alternatives. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1135.5800000000002s)]
*  So definitely impacts Europe much more. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1136.5800000000002s)]
*  It impacts China. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1138.8200000000002s)]
*  Like the reason I think that this, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1139.66s)]
*  there's so many people lined up here. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1144.02s)]
*  Like this is not good for China. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1145.86s)]
*  China wants to be able to ship stuff quickly to Europe [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1148.1s)]
*  and get it to market. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1150.1399999999999s)]
*  So to the extent that they have any impact, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1151.42s)]
*  I think they're gonna be clearly on the same side [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1153.5s)]
*  as the United States here. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1155.06s)]
*  Europe obviously has it. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1155.9s)]
*  And the other thing that I haven't heard anyone talk about [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1157.3s)]
*  is like, you look at that map, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1158.62s)]
*  they're blockading not just the Suez, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1160.26s)]
*  but they're blockading Saudi Arabia. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1161.98s)]
*  The Saudi's biggest port is in Jeddah right up there. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1163.62s)]
*  Well, I don't think they're gonna tolerate [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1167.36s)]
*  being cut off from the world. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1169.58s)]
*  Yemen taking on Saudi seems like an unwise idea. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1171.1s)]
*  Well, they've been at war in the past as David pointed out. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1174.1s)]
*  So, and I'm not, I'm certainly no expert. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1176.66s)]
*  By the way, I find this ship to be amazing. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1178.94s)]
*  It's since transited, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1180.8999999999999s)]
*  but this is one of the ships that was there yesterday, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1182.1399999999999s)]
*  just going for it. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1184.18s)]
*  And if you look at the destination, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1185.78s)]
*  it says armed guard on board. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1187.18s)]
*  They set that in the AIS GPS transponder [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1190.1s)]
*  so that if anyone comes after him, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1193.22s)]
*  you know what you're gonna get. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1194.3799999999999s)]
*  I have two comments. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1196.1399999999999s)]
*  When I looked at this in the last couple of days, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1198.02s)]
*  that was sort of my takeaway, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1200.3s)]
*  which is that the really significant impacts [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1201.7s)]
*  are downstream to Europe consumer prices. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1205.02s)]
*  So I think like European inflation [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1209.02s)]
*  has more chance of upticking again than America does. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1211.4199999999998s)]
*  Because I think the practical reality [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1216.3799999999999s)]
*  is what you said, Ryan, they'll just, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1217.98s)]
*  the need to ship is inelastic. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1220.7s)]
*  And so they'll just pay 8% more [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1222.34s)]
*  and they'll just go to the East coast in a more, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1223.86s)]
*  in a longer way through the Cape of Good Hope or whatever. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1226.86s)]
*  The second comment I think to me is [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1229.42s)]
*  a little bit more macro in nature, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1233.0s)]
*  which is if you look at what's happening now, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1235.46s)]
*  there's a hot war in Israel and Gaza. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1239.22s)]
*  And theoretically now there's a hot war in Yemen. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1243.42s)]
*  I think the positive take on this [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1246.54s)]
*  is that it actually puts the Middle East [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1249.6200000000001s)]
*  in a position to resolve all of these things. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1252.42s)]
*  And what I mean is the following. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1255.26s)]
*  If you're Saudi Arabia or if you're the UAE [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1256.9s)]
*  or if you're Qatar, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1259.6200000000001s)]
*  what you really wanna do is build [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1261.8200000000002s)]
*  for the next 30 to 40 years. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1263.3000000000002s)]
*  They've said it as much. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1265.0600000000002s)]
*  They want to pull trillions of dollars of oil [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1266.18s)]
*  and that gas out of the ground. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1268.5s)]
*  They wanna monetize it. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1270.3400000000001s)]
*  And then they wanna invest in their people. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1271.8600000000001s)]
*  The last thing they need is to be bookended [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1273.66s)]
*  by two hot wars largely propagated [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1275.5800000000002s)]
*  by a third party actor in Iran. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1278.3000000000002s)]
*  And so I think if there was not resolved [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1280.5400000000002s)]
*  for them to get aligned, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1283.02s)]
*  I think that the resolve now really amps up. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1284.76s)]
*  Saudi Arabia doesn't wanna be in the middle of this nonsense. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1287.6s)]
*  Qatar doesn't wanna be in the middle of this nonsense. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1291.8799999999999s)]
*  UAE does not. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1293.64s)]
*  And then the fact that Canada, America, Britain, France [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1294.92s)]
*  are now all of a sudden pulled in. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1298.64s)]
*  And China, as you said, Ryan, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1300.68s)]
*  I didn't even think about the implications of China [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1302.0s)]
*  as a supplier of record for most of these goods. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1303.8s)]
*  All roads I think lead, in my opinion, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1307.12s)]
*  to a coming together of folks to say, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1310.92s)]
*  okay, let's use this as a definitive moment [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1313.0s)]
*  to just clean the decks here. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1315.4s)]
*  And I think that that'll put a lot of pressure on Iran, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1317.64s)]
*  a lot of pressure on the money flows. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1320.42s)]
*  I suspect that both of these two hot wars [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1322.6200000000001s)]
*  get resolved quickly because the larger [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1324.76s)]
*  multi-decade implications for the Middle East are too big [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1327.2s)]
*  to let it be subsumed by the Houthi rebels or Hamas. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1330.28s)]
*  It's interesting here how you see, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1334.0s)]
*  Israel's a relatively small economy in the world. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1336.02s)]
*  But you start to see in the same way [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1340.16s)]
*  that Ukraine is not a big economy, Russia is not that big, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1341.54s)]
*  but it has a massive, the war there has just a massive impact [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1344.5s)]
*  via the commodities markets [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1347.78s)]
*  because Russia is such an important supplier of commodities. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1349.04s)]
*  And now you see what, Israel and Gaza relatively small, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1352.0s)]
*  potentially a small regional conflict, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1356.42s)]
*  big global implications because of everything [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1358.62s)]
*  that goes behind it. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1360.62s)]
*  But now you see the spread to something [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1361.6599999999999s)]
*  that really could impact, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1363.58s)]
*  if this is an extension of that conflict, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1364.8999999999999s)]
*  now you're seeing, wow, this actually has the ability [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1366.62s)]
*  to extend to global markets in a way that's similar [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1368.34s)]
*  to what happened in Russia and Ukraine [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1372.1999999999998s)]
*  where all of a sudden commodity markets are impacted [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1373.04s)]
*  and you're seeing that inflation. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1374.52s)]
*  But I don't know, Chamath, if your view is, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1377.58s)]
*  hey, we're gonna have progress [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1380.04s)]
*  because progress is good or something, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1382.08s)]
*  I don't know that that's necessarily the direction [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1383.4799999999998s)]
*  that the world follows. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1385.52s)]
*  Like you could have terrible stuff. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1386.4799999999998s)]
*  I think you're sitting in Dubai or Saudi or Qatar, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1387.56s)]
*  you're thinking this is the last thing we need, for sure. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1389.8s)]
*  Well, I think that's definitely true. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1392.8s)]
*  Multi-decade, multi-trillion dollar investment plans [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1394.5s)]
*  and we're gonna let the Houthi rebels derail that? [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1397.12s)]
*  And literally on ports, like Saudi's trying to build [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1400.36s)]
*  a big port as part of the Neom project [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1402.12s)]
*  there in the Northwest of the country on the Red Sea, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1403.7199999999998s)]
*  which would be cut off. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1406.76s)]
*  I mean, it's not gonna fly. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1407.76s)]
*  Yeah, look, Saudi Arabia is in a really tough spot here [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1410.1999999999998s)]
*  because what happened is after the Houthis [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1412.4399999999998s)]
*  deposed the monarch there in 2014, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1414.8s)]
*  Saudi Arabia started fighting a war [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1418.04s)]
*  to restore the leader in 2015 [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1419.8s)]
*  and that war went on for almost a decade, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1422.7199999999998s)]
*  created a huge humanitarian crisis, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1424.6399999999999s)]
*  really under-reported compared to other crises. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1426.56s)]
*  There were hundreds of thousands of civilians [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1430.48s)]
*  who were killed, millions of people displaced when hungry. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1431.96s)]
*  Finally, that war again got paused by a fragile ceasefire [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1435.0s)]
*  that was negotiated, I guess, in the last year or so [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1441.16s)]
*  and then simultaneous to that, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1444.12s)]
*  there was a rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1447.2s)]
*  that was brokered by China. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1449.84s)]
*  And so the last thing Saudi Arabia wants to do [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1452.6399999999999s)]
*  is get involved in restarting this war [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1454.48s)]
*  or restarting hostile relations with Iran. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1458.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, they would like to move beyond that, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1461.2s)]
*  which is why they're not participating [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1462.92s)]
*  in this Operation Prosperity Guardian. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1465.0s)]
*  The problem they have is that the Houthis [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1467.52s)]
*  aren't gonna stop doing what they're doing [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1471.08s)]
*  until Israel's war in Gaza stops [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1472.64s)]
*  and Netanyahu just in the last 24 hours [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1475.76s)]
*  made it clear that Israel won't stop fighting. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1478.52s)]
*  They will not agree to another ceasefire [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1482.0s)]
*  until Hamas is eliminated. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1483.6s)]
*  So, Chamath, I think you're right [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1485.6s)]
*  that if there were a ceasefire, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1486.84s)]
*  that this situation would go away very, very quickly [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1488.12s)]
*  and normal shipping would be restored. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1491.04s)]
*  However, I'm not sure you're gonna get the parties [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1493.52s)]
*  to agree to a ceasefire anytime soon. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1496.08s)]
*  I mean, the Israelis seem pretty determined [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1498.1999999999998s)]
*  not to agree to a ceasefire. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1500.8s)]
*  I think the Biden administration clearly would like that. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1502.28s)]
*  I think they would like this problem to be over. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1505.0s)]
*  But with the continuation of hostilities in Gaza, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1507.28s)]
*  you continue to have the potential [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1510.1999999999998s)]
*  for these second order effects, these kind of knock-on effects. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1512.52s)]
*  And like I mentioned, one is the Houthis [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1515.6s)]
*  and other are all these American bases [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1517.76s)]
*  that are under attack right now by these Shia militias. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1519.96s)]
*  So, I think this has the potential to be a black swan in 2024, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1523.6s)]
*  meaning that somehow the Israel-Hamas war [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1526.48s)]
*  spirals into a larger regional war that pulls the US in. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1530.92s)]
*  I'm not saying that's gonna happen, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1534.32s)]
*  but I think the potential is there the longer this goes on. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1536.2s)]
*  And I think that if that does happen, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1538.76s)]
*  there could be the potential for an oil shock. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1541.28s)]
*  By the way, the Houthis have said that if the US attacks Yemen, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1542.96s)]
*  they will light the Saudi oil fields on fire. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1547.96s)]
*  Now, I'm not sure they have the potential to do that. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1550.36s)]
*  I mean, presumably if they had the potential to do it, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1552.0s)]
*  they would have done it during their long war. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1554.2s)]
*  So, that probably is just hyperbolic rhetoric. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1555.76s)]
*  But there's so many ways for this [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1559.28s)]
*  to somehow turn into a larger Middle Eastern war. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1561.56s)]
*  To your point, Shamath, I think, you know, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1564.72s)]
*  I've been meeting with folks in Doha and Riyadh [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1567.32s)]
*  and Abu Dhabi and Dubai for the last six months. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1570.3999999999999s)]
*  And I was talking to people this past weekend. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1573.6799999999998s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1575.8s)]
*  There are a group of people with an agenda, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1576.72s)]
*  which is to modernize the economies there, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1579.48s)]
*  to move off-petro and to move into technology [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1581.8799999999999s)]
*  and to move into hospitality with the Neon Project, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1584.76s)]
*  as you pointed out, Ryan. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1587.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's not gonna get derailed. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1589.2s)]
*  And those are the most powerful, you know, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1590.72s)]
*  deep-pocketed influential forces there. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1593.2s)]
*  And so, yeah, they're working with the United States. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1595.76s)]
*  And any of these rebels, et cetera, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1598.6s)]
*  I think they're going to be dealt with [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1601.28s)]
*  because people want prosperity [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1604.12s)]
*  and they want to keep evolving these societies [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1605.4s)]
*  and moving them forward. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1608.24s)]
*  And normalization. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1609.44s)]
*  Normalization, yeah. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1610.64s)]
*  I mean, have you ever, have you guys, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1611.56s)]
*  who's been to Riyadh here? [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1613.96s)]
*  I have. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1615.32s)]
*  Yeah, I think Freeburg or Sax, have you been to Riyadh? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1616.16s)]
*  No. Ever? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1619.08s)]
*  Freeburg? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1620.32s)]
*  Ever? I mean. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1621.64s)]
*  No, it's beautiful. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1623.08s)]
*  And it's changing rapidly, massively. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1624.84s)]
*  And obviously Dubai's already been changing. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1628.36s)]
*  And then Doan, it was awesome. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1630.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm not arguing that Saudi Arabia isn't a great place [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1632.72s)]
*  and they want to do the right thing here, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1636.76s)]
*  but you're acting like the Houthis can just be dealt with. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1637.96s)]
*  What does that mean to you? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1640.24s)]
*  Well, I think that the larger forces are united [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1642.0s)]
*  in wanting to have prosperity for their people, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1645.3999999999999s)]
*  education for their people, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1648.0s)]
*  and to build deep ties with the West and the East [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1650.04s)]
*  to do commerce. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1653.84s)]
*  And so I think those forces are greater [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1655.5600000000002s)]
*  than maybe some of the traditional forces that are at work [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1656.88s)]
*  and these longer term conflicts maybe are not as important [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1660.1200000000001s)]
*  to the leaders and the citizens of these countries [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1663.88s)]
*  as prosperity is. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1667.3600000000001s)]
*  And so when I say dealt with, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1668.6000000000001s)]
*  I think they're gonna just focus on developing [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1670.44s)]
*  their economies over these skirmishes. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1672.96s)]
*  But are you saying there's gonna be [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1676.04s)]
*  a diplomatic solution here? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1676.88s)]
*  Cause I don't see it. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1677.96s)]
*  I mean, here's the problem. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1678.8s)]
*  Israel's not stopping its war in Gaza. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1679.72s)]
*  The Houthis aren't gonna stop until Israel stops. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1682.2s)]
*  So how do you make them stop? [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1685.3200000000002s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1686.48s)]
*  Containing these conflicts is probably the likely scenario [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1688.44s)]
*  when I've asked that same question to the people [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1691.3200000000002s)]
*  who are in those regions. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1693.28s)]
*  And when I spoke to them, they're all about containment. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1695.24s)]
*  They don't think there's a resolution [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1698.88s)]
*  like we might think about it here on the West [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1701.44s)]
*  that there's not gonna be a conflict [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1702.96s)]
*  between Palestinians and Israelis. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1705.0400000000002s)]
*  They just think containing it [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1707.76s)]
*  and having it not be an all out war is success. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1708.92s)]
*  Well, what do you think's gonna happen? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1712.64s)]
*  I mean, at some point the US isn't gonna support. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1713.8400000000001s)]
*  We have two sides who are implacably resolved. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1715.5600000000002s)]
*  The Israelis to continuing their fight against Hamas [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1718.8000000000002s)]
*  and the Houthis to continuing to lash out at Israel [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1721.96s)]
*  or the West in general until that stops. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1726.52s)]
*  The likely scenario is that Netanyahu is losing support. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1730.0s)]
*  That's what every Israeli and every person in the region [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1732.52s)]
*  says is that Netanyahu is not gonna last long-term. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1734.68s)]
*  So what have you heard, Sax? [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1739.0s)]
*  What do you think the resolution is? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1740.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think it's interesting [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1741.64s)]
*  if you look at Israeli domestic politics, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1743.24s)]
*  it's true that Netanyahu is unpopular, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1745.44s)]
*  but something like 90% of the Israeli public [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1748.2s)]
*  favors the continuation of this war [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1751.5200000000002s)]
*  until Hamas is eliminated. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1754.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, the Israeli people are really, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1755.48s)]
*  I think, hardened on this question. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1757.76s)]
*  Those tapes of Hamas atrocities on October 7th [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1760.0s)]
*  were compiled into a film. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1765.3200000000002s)]
*  They were recorded by the Hamas fighters' own GoPros. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1767.0s)]
*  And the Israeli people have watched all of those things [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1770.92s)]
*  and they are resolved to destroy Hamas. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1773.0800000000002s)]
*  Now you can argue with their tactics [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1776.28s)]
*  and I'm just stating the fact, okay? [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1778.28s)]
*  I'm not judging it. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1780.4s)]
*  And the point is just whether Netanyahu survives or not, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1782.6000000000001s)]
*  I think the Israeli public wants to eliminate Hamas. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1785.0800000000002s)]
*  So I think they are resolved, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1788.3200000000002s)]
*  I think the Houthis are resolved, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1789.48s)]
*  and the Houthis control this choke point [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1791.24s)]
*  so they can stop or interfere with global trade. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1793.44s)]
*  And I think, look, there could be a ceasefire. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1797.0s)]
*  I think Biden clearly would like there to be a ceasefire, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1799.76s)]
*  certainly before the election. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1802.08s)]
*  And that would bring all of this to a rapid end. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1804.6799999999998s)]
*  But if there's not a ceasefire, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1806.4799999999998s)]
*  I don't understand how you just stop the Houthis. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1807.84s)]
*  I mean, the only way to stop them [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1810.28s)]
*  is if you wanna go to war with them. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1812.6799999999998s)]
*  That's what we're talking about. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1814.4799999999998s)]
*  So we're talking about the US using its naval assets [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1815.52s)]
*  to go get the Houthis. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1820.78s)]
*  Or the regions Shemath mentioned [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1821.62s)]
*  could use diplomacy and or financial measures. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1823.0s)]
*  And so those are other options on the table. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1826.1599999999999s)]
*  That's not gonna work with the Houthis. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1828.0s)]
*  Well, Noeasy Solutions here, Ryan, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1830.0s)]
*  thanks for jumping on the pod with us once again. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1830.88s)]
*  One question, how much more resilient post-COVID, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1834.64s)]
*  if at all, are supply chains? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1838.92s)]
*  Because you talked about wanting to make them more resilient [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1840.52s)]
*  and that was a major focus for Flexport. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1842.72s)]
*  Is it better now post-COVID? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1845.3600000000001s)]
*  Have we done any more? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1847.44s)]
*  No, I think at the physical infrastructure layer, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1848.28s)]
*  nothing's really changed. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1849.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't think, you know, the bottlenecks have gone away [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1851.24s)]
*  just because demand went back down. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1853.6000000000001s)]
*  The US had like a 20% increase in container volume. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1855.24s)]
*  It created all these bottlenecks. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1857.92s)]
*  We couldn't process that many containers in our ports. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1859.14s)]
*  And then the containers now are back at 2019 levels [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1862.1000000000001s)]
*  and everything's flowing normally. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1864.5s)]
*  But I wouldn't say that makes us more resilient. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1865.66s)]
*  It's the same as before. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1867.46s)]
*  And situations like this, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1869.74s)]
*  you learn just how amazing and resilient [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1871.14s)]
*  the global trading network is, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1873.98s)]
*  the global logistics infrastructure, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1876.46s)]
*  but also it's pretty fragile. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1878.1000000000001s)]
*  If a small group of rebels can fire missiles and you go, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1879.5800000000002s)]
*  well, even the US Navy, what are we gonna do? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1883.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is kind of an asymmetric warfare type thing. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1885.0200000000002s)]
*  They shoot a $20,000 drone [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1888.9s)]
*  and we need a $2 million missile to shoot it down. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1890.34s)]
*  Like it's not a great setup [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1892.46s)]
*  and it's not clear that firing missiles back [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1895.6200000000001s)]
*  is gonna open it back up. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1897.54s)]
*  And so, yeah, I think it's much more fragile [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1899.5s)]
*  than we realize as civilization always has been. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1901.98s)]
*  You know, it takes a hundred years [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1904.14s)]
*  to develop a civilization [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1906.42s)]
*  and an afternoon to go back to barbarisms. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1908.14s)]
*  And air freight you had talked about previously, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1910.94s)]
*  that's still four or five times more expensive than sea freight. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1913.3s)]
*  Is that about right, that multiple? [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1916.98s)]
*  In general, that's a reasonable assumption [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1918.78s)]
*  is about four to five times more. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1921.1s)]
*  The air freight networks are very small in proportion [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1922.14s)]
*  to give you a sense like one of these container ships [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1924.6200000000001s)]
*  that flows through the ever given [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1926.98s)]
*  is the world's most famous container ship [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1928.3s)]
*  that got stuck in the Suez Canal a few years ago. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1929.9s)]
*  That one holds about 10,000 40 foot containers. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1931.58s)]
*  A 747, this is basically the biggest cargo plane out there [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1935.3s)]
*  can hold seven 40 foot containers. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1938.98s)]
*  And so if you have a diversion of global ocean freight [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1942.02s)]
*  will rapidly flow over to, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1944.46s)]
*  it doesn't take a lot of freight going, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1946.18s)]
*  hey, I'm gonna ship this by air instead [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1947.5s)]
*  to suddenly have the air freight markets get impacted. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1949.8200000000002s)]
*  So it hasn't yet, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1952.0600000000002s)]
*  the airlines are a little bit less connected to this market [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1955.02s)]
*  and haven't instantly said, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1958.5800000000002s)]
*  hey, we're raising prices in January, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1959.6200000000001s)]
*  but I suspect if this lasts another week or two, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1961.22s)]
*  you're gonna see big run-ups in air freight prices. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1962.98s)]
*  And these are global markets. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1965.38s)]
*  The price of freight from Asia to the US gets impacted [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1966.5s)]
*  because they're pulling ships off, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1969.94s)]
*  the supply gets redirected, the planes get rerouted. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1971.3s)]
*  It is a global market. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1974.8600000000001s)]
*  So an impact here will affect prices [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1976.6200000000001s)]
*  of shipping Asia to US as well. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=1977.5s)]

*  Ryan did bring up a really interesting point there [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2006.0800000000002s)]
*  that you don't hear enough, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2008.44s)]
*  which was the asymmetry of the warfare [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2009.68s)]
*  that the hoodies can launch a drone or a cheap missile [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2011.5600000000002s)]
*  that costs thousands of dollars [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2015.64s)]
*  and it costs us millions of dollars to shoot it down. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2016.92s)]
*  That is just not sustainable for the US. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2019.72s)]
*  We see this happening in Ukraine as well. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2022.6000000000001s)]
*  All these multimillion dollar expensive tanks [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2025.5600000000002s)]
*  get taken out by a landmine or by a cheap RPG [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2027.64s)]
*  or something like that, that costs a few thousand dollars. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2032.5200000000002s)]
*  It's also the fact that if you send a drone [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2036.1200000000001s)]
*  and it blows up on a ship [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2038.76s)]
*  and it costs you a couple thousand bucks to do that, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2040.8000000000002s)]
*  the lack of risk tolerance, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2043.48s)]
*  the fact that the insurance companies [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2045.44s)]
*  won't insure the ship anymore, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2046.8400000000001s)]
*  means that now that ship can't travel [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2048.56s)]
*  and that's tens of millions of dollars of commerce [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2050.4s)]
*  that gets shut down off of a few thousand dollar investment. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2053.92s)]
*  So there's a deep asymmetry in the sensitivity [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2056.8s)]
*  we also have to loss. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2059.32s)]
*  We won't take, hey, well, maybe one in 10 ships [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2062.0s)]
*  can blow up, let's keep going. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2064.0s)]
*  It's the fact that there's no margin for loss. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2065.2s)]
*  There's no allowance for loss. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2069.16s)]
*  As a result, any sort of threat of loss [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2070.72s)]
*  means that the whole system shuts down. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2072.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm not advocating that we should, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2074.3199999999997s)]
*  but it's just the condition we're in. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2075.56s)]
*  I also think the other point I didn't make, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2076.7599999999998s)]
*  I would imagine that this behavior with the Houthis [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2078.2799999999997s)]
*  is driven in part by the emboldenment [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2081.16s)]
*  that arises following October 7th [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2084.72s)]
*  and the praise that Hamas has received globally. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2086.72s)]
*  And if you believe that to be true, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2091.3599999999997s)]
*  there are many other groups like this [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2093.76s)]
*  that may get emboldened and you start to see more activity [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2097.0800000000004s)]
*  in other regions as well, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2100.28s)]
*  that you can have these kind of outsized impacts [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2102.44s)]
*  and folks suddenly start to take action. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2105.0800000000004s)]
*  But I think that's why we're between a rock [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2108.7200000000003s)]
*  and a hard place here is that on the one hand, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2110.6400000000003s)]
*  if we don't do anything, then you're emboldening [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2112.7200000000003s)]
*  that behavior and if you do do something, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2116.36s)]
*  you're escalating the war. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2118.28s)]
*  Yeah, and to your point, saying like, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2119.84s)]
*  hey, the US is gonna enter the war, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2122.1600000000003s)]
*  I think that there may be this moment [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2123.84s)]
*  where it's not even an option, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2125.2400000000002s)]
*  that the US is being provoked in a way [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2126.88s)]
*  that you can't say no, you have to, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2128.88s)]
*  maybe they end up having to act. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2131.2s)]
*  The guerrilla warfare aspect of this is super fascinating [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2132.4s)]
*  because you can really do incredible damage [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2136.32s)]
*  to very expensive airplanes with hypersonic missiles [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2138.2400000000002s)]
*  that go incredibly fast or like Mach 5 or something insane [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2141.56s)]
*  and they're cheap. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2144.72s)]
*  So $100 million or $20 million fighter jet [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2145.76s)]
*  can just be annihilated by a couple of $100,000 [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2149.64s)]
*  in hypersonic missiles. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2152.96s)]
*  All right, there's been a ton of M&A activity [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2155.32s)]
*  and M&A deals that have been canceled. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2158.84s)]
*  Adobe Figma has been called off [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2161.52s)]
*  and Illumina and Grail has been unwound as well. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2164.6s)]
*  The big headline is that after a 15 month review process, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2169.16s)]
*  Adobe and Figma called off their merger. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2172.48s)]

*  It was a $20 billion cash in stock merger [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2176.64s)]
*  that was agreed to back in September of 2022. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2179.4s)]
*  And there's tons to unpack here, shareholders, employees, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2183.8s)]
*  a startup ecosystem and of course, limited partners [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2187.88s)]
*  who were expecting huge paydays from Figma being sold [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2192.56s)]
*  to Adobe are now back to a waiting game [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2197.2400000000002s)]
*  of figuring out if this company can go public, et cetera. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2200.96s)]
*  Chamath, you had tons of thoughts on this [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2203.28s)]
*  and maybe you could educate everybody [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2205.48s)]
*  on the Illumina-Grail deal [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2206.92s)]
*  since I don't think people understand that. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2209.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think there are three deals or almost deals [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2210.56s)]
*  that got essentially called off or canceled [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2216.68s)]
*  or never consummated in the last few weeks [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2219.52s)]
*  which show a pretty interesting trend. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2223.56s)]
*  So the first, as you said, Jason, was Adobe Figma. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2225.32s)]
*  The second was Cigna and Humana. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2229.08s)]
*  They were proposing a multi-deck-a-billion dollar merger [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2232.16s)]
*  and it was very clear that the FTC [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2236.08s)]
*  was going to have a huge fit around it. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2240.0s)]
*  So they said that we're not even gonna do it [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2242.4s)]
*  and then Cigna just said they'll do a $10 billion [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2244.12s)]
*  buyback instead. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2246.48s)]
*  And then in the craziest example, Illumina and Grail. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2248.04s)]
*  So Illumina makes these gene sequencing machines [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2251.12s)]
*  and Grail makes one of the leading tests [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2253.84s)]
*  for free DNA cancer detection. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2257.8s)]
*  And at the time, Illumina owned almost half the company. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2262.0s)]
*  They bought the other half, they merged it in, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2265.64s)]
*  even though the regulator said, hey, hold on, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2267.72s)]
*  we have an issue with this. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2269.76s)]
*  And now they're being forced to unwind the merger. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2271.2400000000002s)]
*  So to pull this company back out and divest it. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2273.88s)]
*  I think the point of this is two things. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2279.2000000000003s)]
*  One is that there is no viable M&A path [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2281.96s)]
*  for early stage venture capital businesses. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2286.1600000000003s)]
*  So if you can't have a $20 billion merger [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2290.36s)]
*  or a $40 billion merger or a 15 or $20 billion M&A [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2292.7200000000003s)]
*  with a high degree of confidence, [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2297.0400000000004s)]
*  then the path to liquidity through M&A [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2299.36s)]
*  is less than 20% of the outcomes. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2301.2400000000002s)]
*  Which means that the overwhelming path to get liquid [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2303.5600000000004s)]
*  is what you said, Jason, which is IPO. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2306.2000000000003s)]
*  But the problem is the second part, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2308.52s)]
*  which is that the capital markets in the United States [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2310.52s)]
*  are not ready or not in a position [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2312.6800000000003s)]
*  to support all this IPO liquidity, why? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2314.92s)]
*  The banks won't underwrite. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2317.5600000000004s)]
*  There aren't enough researchers, research analysts [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2320.48s)]
*  that'll cover these stocks. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2323.36s)]
*  The ways in which the banks make money [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2326.32s)]
*  have become so constrained. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2328.6s)]
*  And so I'm kind of left pondering to myself, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2330.08s)]
*  how do you go back to a world of like the 90s, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2332.7999999999997s)]
*  where startups four and five years old would go public [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2335.6s)]
*  to raise capital? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2339.16s)]
*  I don't think that that's gonna happen. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2341.44s)]
*  So I don't know exactly what happens to us, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2342.7999999999997s)]
*  except that we'll have companies gestating [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2344.72s)]
*  for 15 and 20 years. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2347.16s)]
*  And I think that just has a chilling effect [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2349.56s)]
*  because it's like what investor wants to put money away [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2351.2s)]
*  locked up in highly liquid stuff for 20 years? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2353.52s)]
*  What rate of return do you need to give them [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2355.96s)]
*  to make sure that they're not underwriting? [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2358.96s)]
*  And I think that's the first part [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2361.0s)]
*  that makes them want to do that. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2362.6400000000003s)]
*  So something has to change [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2363.96s)]
*  because if the M&A market can't exist, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2365.7200000000003s)]
*  then we need to change the rules of the capital market [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2367.96s)]
*  so that there's incentives for these banks [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2369.96s)]
*  to underwrite these companies to go public. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2371.56s)]
*  Well, I guess there's two things, Sax, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2373.96s)]
*  that could change this dramatically. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2375.4s)]
*  One is if we put in more conservative, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2377.1200000000003s)]
*  Republican, libertarian, et cetera, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2381.2400000000002s)]
*  less regulatory regime in Washington, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2383.32s)]
*  and then the second is direct listings, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2386.96s)]
*  dare I say, SPACs and alternative ways [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2390.48s)]
*  to get companies public. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2392.2400000000002s)]
*  It may not be the gold standard as a traditional IPO, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2393.2s)]
*  but at least we get those liquidity started. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2399.3s)]
*  And I guess third, Sax, and I'll get your thoughts on this, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2402.6s)]
*  for private investors and their LPs, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2406.32s)]
*  everybody seems to be focused on building strong, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2409.56s)]
*  stable, cash-flowing businesses. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2412.08s)]
*  And we've seen all the companies that went public, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2415.08s)]
*  whether it's Airbnb or Uber, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2417.5600000000004s)]
*  are now focused on ringing the cash register [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2418.4s)]
*  and being profitable. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2420.7200000000003s)]
*  So ultimately, maybe this logjam and M&A blockage [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2421.5600000000004s)]
*  makes everybody focused on sustainable, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2425.36s)]
*  profitable companies, and that's a good thing long-term. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2427.38s)]
*  What do you think, Sax? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2429.1200000000003s)]
*  Look, like I said last week [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2429.96s)]
*  in relation to the Figma-Adobe deal, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2431.0400000000004s)]
*  the fact that regulators took 15 months [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2433.6800000000003s)]
*  to analyze the deal only to come to the conclusion [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2436.0s)]
*  that they basically weren't gonna allow it, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2438.84s)]
*  and then Adobe finally killed it, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2440.5200000000004s)]
*  is gonna have a chilling effect on M&A and Silicon Valley. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2442.44s)]
*  I mean, if acquirers and targets [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2444.88s)]
*  can't have confidence that the deal will be approved, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2447.48s)]
*  and in fact, they're gonna be left in limbo [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2450.2400000000002s)]
*  for over a year waiting for speculative approval, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2451.78s)]
*  they're gonna be less likely to do deals in the first place. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2455.42s)]
*  And I'm sure Adobe's not happy about the fact [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2457.88s)]
*  they gotta pay a billion-dollar breakup fee, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2459.6400000000003s)]
*  which, by the way, was a really smart thing [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2461.82s)]
*  for Figma to negotiate. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2463.1800000000003s)]
*  I mean, if you're a company that started [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2464.2400000000002s)]
*  that's gonna get acquired, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2466.52s)]
*  you need a pretty big breakup fee now [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2467.4s)]
*  as insurance on the deal, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2469.6s)]
*  because there's a very good chance [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2471.2200000000003s)]
*  that regulators aren't gonna allow it. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2472.76s)]
*  So yeah, absolutely. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2474.08s)]
*  The fact that regulators got in the way of the Adobe deal, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2476.0s)]
*  and moreover, the way that they did it [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2479.64s)]
*  with this protracted delay, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2481.2s)]
*  is absolutely gonna have a chilling effect [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2482.8199999999997s)]
*  on M&A and Silicon Valley. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2484.36s)]
*  And look, there are only two good outcomes for a startup. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2486.16s)]
*  You can either IPO or you can get acquired, that's it. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2491.2799999999997s)]
*  The third is basically you go out of business. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2494.24s)]
*  That's the third outcome. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2496.18s)]
*  So when you take half the potential exits off the table, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2497.6s)]
*  you're absolutely making it tougher for VCs and founders [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2501.42s)]
*  to get a good return, it's that simple. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2505.02s)]
*  And that is gonna have a depressing effect [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2507.2200000000003s)]
*  on the investing of risk capital in Silicon Valley. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2509.06s)]
*  I don't think it's a good thing for anyone. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2512.84s)]
*  And by the way, even if the US sort of fixes this, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2514.0s)]
*  even if we get a regime that's more friendly towards M&A, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2517.2400000000002s)]
*  you still have the EU to worry about. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2520.94s)]
*  And you also have the UK to worry about [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2523.5s)]
*  because they're not part of the EU thanks to Brexit. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2525.2200000000003s)]
*  The UK, like I said last week, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2527.1800000000003s)]
*  they're like the Chihuahua who's leading the pack. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2529.46s)]
*  They're the smallest market, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2532.2200000000003s)]
*  but they're the most aggressive on antitrust enforcement. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2533.42s)]
*  Sacks, they may just be the beard [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2535.66s)]
*  for the US and the Europeans. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2537.06s)]
*  It's possible, but in any event, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2538.7s)]
*  now you got three regulators to worry about, not just one. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2540.2200000000003s)]
*  And like I said last week, I think if you're a startup [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2543.3s)]
*  and you're trying to consider [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2546.5s)]
*  where to put your Europe office, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2547.54s)]
*  I would not choose the UK anymore. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2550.02s)]
*  I used to think that the UK was number one [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2551.62s)]
*  because it was so easy, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2554.34s)]
*  but you don't wanna create that nexus if you can help it. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2555.2200000000003s)]
*  It might subject you to a competition authority [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2558.44s)]
*  you don't wanna deal with later when you get acquired. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2560.92s)]
*  Yeah, I would have just opted out of the UK. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2562.7200000000003s)]
*  I would have called their bluff, as I said last week. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2564.32s)]
*  Freiburg, any solutions here, you think, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2566.92s)]
*  to solving this problem in VC land? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2568.96s)]
*  Or do we just have to build stronger, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2570.88s)]
*  more profitable companies and be more patient [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2573.2400000000002s)]
*  about taking them public since M&A is not on the table? [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2575.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't know if I'd take the antitrust regime [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2578.44s)]
*  as being the core driver of M&A not being on the table. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2580.64s)]
*  I mean, there's a couple of these examples, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2584.64s)]
*  but I don't think there's a predominance of this going on. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2586.56s)]
*  I think that there's a lot of smaller deals [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2590.68s)]
*  that still end up being good outcomes. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2593.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, we've also talked a lot about the lower cost [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2595.36s)]
*  of capital in starting software businesses [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2598.44s)]
*  and the era of AI type tools. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2600.56s)]
*  And that leads to being able to hit a 100X [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2604.7599999999998s)]
*  if you put small enough amount of capital in [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2609.2799999999997s)]
*  and have a decent outcome [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2613.08s)]
*  where you're not building the market monopoly [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2614.32s)]
*  in some particular market. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2616.52s)]
*  It doesn't feel to me like that's the biggest driver [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2618.7200000000003s)]
*  of concern here. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2621.6000000000004s)]
*  The biggest driver of concern is just all the return [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2622.76s)]
*  on capital metrics that the big buyers are having to face. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2626.2400000000002s)]
*  Return on invested capital is becoming more important [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2629.52s)]
*  than it's ever been because we're talking [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2631.8s)]
*  about trillion dollar market cap buyers. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2633.8s)]
*  And so that's how they're measured. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2636.4s)]
*  And so they have to be really thoughtful [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2637.6000000000004s)]
*  about how they're deploying capital. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2638.8s)]
*  In a high interest rate environment, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2640.6400000000003s)]
*  there's a greater sensitivity [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2642.32s)]
*  to a faster path to cash returns [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2644.8s)]
*  than there has been historically. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2647.44s)]
*  So it feels to me like that's, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2649.92s)]
*  and I would imagine if I'm Adobe [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2650.96s)]
*  and I'm looking at the Sphigma deal, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2652.2400000000002s)]
*  do I keep fighting it? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2653.36s)]
*  Or at this point paying a billion dollars [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2654.92s)]
*  is probably net accretive to them. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2657.1200000000003s)]
*  I think the stock price went up [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2658.4s)]
*  when they called the deal off, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2659.52s)]
*  which highlights that it was probably [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2661.1600000000003s)]
*  a better investment for them to say, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2662.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna pay a billion dollars [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2664.04s)]
*  to actually get out of this deal at this point. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2665.04s)]
*  And I think we see more of that happening, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2667.8s)]
*  which is this rationalization of timelines to ROIC [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2669.12s)]
*  in a high interest rate environment. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2673.48s)]
*  Shemath, deals do get done. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2674.68s)]
*  There's a lot more tolerance [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2676.0s)]
*  for smaller deals, obviously. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2676.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Salesforce was able to acquire Slack. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2678.4s)]
*  That was 2020. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2680.56s)]
*  Amazon was able to acquire Whole Foods. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2681.68s)]
*  Walt Disney, 21st Century Fox, with the X-Men. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2684.2s)]
*  Those were a different era. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2687.88s)]
*  I really think that the large- [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2689.0s)]
*  Though these are all 2016 to 2020, you're right. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2690.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but those were a very different era. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2692.04s)]
*  I don't think that that's what you can expect anymore. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2693.68s)]
*  I don't think you can underwrite [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2696.7599999999998s)]
*  to get a $20 billion deal done in any industry. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2697.92s)]
*  Remember, met her Facebook, buying WhatsApp for, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2701.56s)]
*  what was it, 17 billion? [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2704.48s)]
*  I mean, that was one of the biggest venture returns ever. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2705.88s)]
*  Yeah, today that could never happen. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2708.6800000000003s)]
*  Never happened? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2710.48s)]
*  Today that could never happen. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2711.32s)]
*  And that Figma Adobe deal, it was a $20 billion deal, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2712.1600000000003s)]
*  but with the rise in Adobe stock, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2715.52s)]
*  it's really a $30 billion deal [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2719.08s)]
*  if it would have been consummated, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2720.92s)]
*  because half the consideration was in Adobe stock, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2722.08s)]
*  and that has basically doubled. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2724.2400000000002s)]
*  So all of those investors and employees [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2726.32s)]
*  were looking at a $30 billion exit. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2728.7200000000003s)]
*  And look, Figma is gonna do great. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2731.48s)]
*  I think the numbers that came out about Figma, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2733.2000000000003s)]
*  where they're gonna do about 700 million of ARR, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2736.28s)]
*  growing 40%. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2738.84s)]
*  So I don't know, they'll be able to IPO anytime based on that, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2740.6400000000003s)]
*  but what's the multiple they're gonna get? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2744.6800000000003s)]
*  Probably 12 to 15 times, so- [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2746.0400000000004s)]
*  Eight to 10. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2749.76s)]
*  Maybe it's like a $10 billion company in the public markets. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2750.8s)]
*  I mean, growing nicely, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2753.84s)]
*  but it's just not as good an exit. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2755.48s)]
*  I mean, that's a big haircut. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2756.84s)]
*  The positive to this is consumers or retail investors [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2758.8s)]
*  haven't been able to buy IPOs [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2762.64s)]
*  and get in on companies earlier. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2764.28s)]
*  So if people build stronger companies [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2765.64s)]
*  that are more capital efficient, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2767.52s)]
*  then companies can go public earlier. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2769.8s)]
*  As you alluded to Chamath, where Microsoft, Apple, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2771.56s)]
*  a lot of these companies back in the PCR, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2774.04s)]
*  they used to go public in under a decade, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2776.2400000000002s)]
*  and now it's always over a decade. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2778.12s)]
*  So maybe this will make stronger companies that go public. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2779.48s)]
*  And then if there's a regime change [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2782.64s)]
*  and maybe people feel more frisky, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2784.64s)]
*  they still have to get through Europe. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2786.68s)]
*  Biotech is the only market that's always viewed [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2788.36s)]
*  going public as a transitory capital raising moment. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2790.52s)]
*  Every biotech company that goes public, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2794.84s)]
*  in America at least, are startups. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2797.68s)]
*  They're pure startups, it's pure risk capital. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2799.92s)]
*  But the technology side has viewed it very differently. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2803.0s)]
*  It used to be the same. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2808.2799999999997s)]
*  But then it went to like, oh, we must be mature [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2811.24s)]
*  and then it has to be growing really fast [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2814.7200000000003s)]
*  and it has to be profitable. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2816.32s)]
*  There were so many ands, ands, ands [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2817.4s)]
*  that at the end of all of that, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2819.56s)]
*  there were just very few companies that qualified. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2821.48s)]
*  And then by the time they did go public, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2823.88s)]
*  they were 12, 13, 14, 15 years in, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2825.32s)]
*  they're so long in the tooth [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2827.44s)]
*  that their best growth periods are beyond them. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2828.56s)]
*  Now, a couple of companies have bucked that trend, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2830.92s)]
*  but by and large, that's the case. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2833.88s)]
*  And I don't think that's, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2835.6s)]
*  to support what David, what Sac said, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2836.96s)]
*  that's just unsustainable. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2838.92s)]
*  You cannot, you will not have risk capital flow [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2841.7200000000003s)]

*  You gotta build companies that are sustainable [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2852.76s)]
*  and can go public, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2854.6400000000003s)]

*  And it's exacerbated by what Friedberg said, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2857.4s)]
*  which is then that family office or that endowment [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2859.0800000000004s)]
*  who can rip in a check as an LP to a fund, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2862.5600000000004s)]

*  It is gonna be a challenging environment [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2887.3599999999997s)]
*  for some time to come, I think, as we work this out. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2889.2s)]
*  I mean, the thing that I find super interesting [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2892.3199999999997s)]
*  with the SPACs was like, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2894.44s)]
*  you got to invest in some companies [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2895.92s)]
*  that were very early and speculative like Joby. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2897.6s)]
*  Now, how could a consumer ever make [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2900.24s)]
*  that kind of bet your mouth to bet on? [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2902.7999999999997s)]
*  And that wasn't one of yours, I know, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2904.6s)]
*  but it was one of these like incredible moments [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2906.12s)]
*  where you could bet on flying cars, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2908.44s)]
*  literally as a consumer. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2910.0s)]
*  And I think they're actually gonna figure it out. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2911.44s)]
*  I was tempted to buy it, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2913.36s)]
*  and I've been tracking the stock, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2914.32s)]
*  and I'm like, wow, if they actually make air taxis work, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2916.2s)]
*  and it's kind of cool [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2920.16s)]
*  that the public can participate in that. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2921.0s)]
*  And that's what they were saying [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2922.84s)]
*  when there weren't enough IPOs, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2923.92s)]
*  and we had half the number of public companies. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2925.32s)]
*  So I don't know if you have thoughts on it. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2926.96s)]
*  The number of public companies, I think, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2930.96s)]
*  has halved in the last 20 years. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2932.56s)]
*  So are more public companies better than less? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2936.28s)]
*  I don't know, I think that's kind of like a random statement. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2939.76s)]
*  I think what is true is that the public markets [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2942.32s)]
*  used to be used for raising risk capital, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2945.0s)]
*  but the public markets at the time [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2949.48s)]
*  also had a ton of research analysts. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2951.6s)]
*  There would be a lot more coverage of these companies. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2955.04s)]
*  There would be a lot more visibility, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2957.44s)]
*  a lot more checks and balances [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2959.48s)]
*  because people would be meeting with management [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2960.84s)]
*  on a regular basis, writing thoughtful research reports. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2962.92s)]
*  All of that is constrained [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2966.32s)]
*  as the business of being on Wall Street has changed. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2967.48s)]
*  So it's not enough to just all of a sudden [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2970.88s)]
*  have a bunch of companies go public [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2973.08s)]
*  if all of that supporting infrastructure isn't there. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2974.6s)]
*  So this is what I mean by it's a catch-22. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2977.88s)]
*  On the one hand, there's no M&A, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2980.48s)]
*  so you need to have more IPOs, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2983.52s)]
*  but the banks will need to hire more people. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2985.44s)]
*  That comes at a cost, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2988.68s)]
*  which means that they're gonna have [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2989.88s)]
*  to generate more revenue somehow. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2990.88s)]
*  That comes at a cost to somebody else. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2992.92s)]
*  And until that's figured out, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2995.72s)]
*  you're not gonna solve this problem. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2997.36s)]
*  And instead, what's gonna happen is [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=2999.28s)]
*  folks will be less motivated to invest [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3001.6s)]
*  in the innovation economy [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3003.7599999999998s)]
*  because there'll be no path to liquidity. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3006.28s)]
*  And when you do invest, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3008.44s)]
*  you'll invest much smaller amounts of money [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3009.6s)]
*  and you'll make it as part of your risk allocation, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3012.44s)]
*  a smaller piece of the overall pie. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3015.16s)]
*  One, it also means is that if you're an entrepreneur [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3017.12s)]
*  and you haven't started a company yet, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3022.04s)]
*  you may want to seriously consider [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3024.76s)]
*  raising a friends and family around using these AI tools [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3027.12s)]
*  and trying to build a very different kind of business, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3030.6s)]
*  slow and steady, profitable from day one. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3034.04s)]
*  And that's never been rewarded by Silicon Valley VCs. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3037.32s)]
*  But if the reward for VCs don't exist, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3041.16s)]
*  then the VCs themselves won't exist. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3043.92s)]
*  And so you may want to start thinking about [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3046.16s)]
*  different ways to capitalize your business. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3048.12s)]
*  And it's interesting point you make that is very subtle. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3051.16s)]
*  So I just want to restate it here. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3054.12s)]
*  The analysts who are covering companies, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3056.2s)]
*  like say, Joby, I'm just picking this air taxi company [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3059.12s)]
*  because I'm obsessed with it. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3062.16s)]
*  If there's not an infrastructure, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3063.8399999999997s)]
*  those analysts act in a way as a backstop [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3065.56s)]
*  for a bit of pressure on management, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3069.2s)]
*  I think is what you're saying, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3071.2799999999997s)]
*  to hey, perform and we're checking on you [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3072.7999999999997s)]
*  and we're meeting with you. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3074.6s)]
*  So without that, there's just a company sitting out there [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3075.8799999999997s)]
*  and nobody is asking them hard questions [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3079.08s)]
*  and then making decisions to put a buy or a sell rating on it. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3081.7599999999998s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3084.56s)]
*  Maybe you could expand on that missing piece. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3085.3999999999996s)]
*  There is an evolution in the public market. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3087.2s)]
*  So look, the public markets back in the 90s [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3088.72s)]
*  was a bit of a rigged game where you could call a CEO [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3091.16s)]
*  if you had his or her number [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3095.9199999999996s)]
*  and they could tell you things [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3098.12s)]
*  that they didn't tell everybody else. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3099.4s)]
*  And when you look at the folks in their 60s and 70s [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3101.96s)]
*  and 80s who really turned it, I'm sorry folks, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3105.56s)]
*  but they profited massively from that information arbitrage. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3107.56s)]
*  And that changed when there was a regulation called Reg FD [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3112.8399999999997s)]
*  that got passed in America, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3116.3599999999997s)]
*  which said regulation, full disclosure, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3117.6s)]
*  what you tell one, you have to tell everybody, right? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3119.72s)]
*  And that was an attempt by the SEC to level the playing field. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3122.44s)]
*  It was a very smart piece of legislation, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3125.48s)]
*  but what that did was it constrained the touch points [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3129.0s)]
*  that a company would have with the public markets [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3132.72s)]
*  to a few organized events, right? [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3135.2s)]
*  Analyst conferences, research days, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3137.72s)]
*  actually banks are allowed to organize formal company dinners. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3141.32s)]
*  And you'll get all these people together, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3145.08s)]
*  analysts across the entire spectrum, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3147.56s)]
*  from Fidelity to Goldman Sachs to Morgan Stanley. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3149.56s)]
*  And the company has to perform to them [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3153.04s)]
*  and those folks will write both internal and external reports [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3154.6s)]
*  and then they'll have to do the control or sell, right? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3158.2s)]
*  That became the only check and balance [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3161.04s)]
*  to make sure that management was held accountable [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3164.24s)]
*  to the large swath of public shareholders, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3166.8399999999997s)]
*  because otherwise it's not Jason Yu as a shareholder [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3168.7999999999997s)]
*  of Joby quite honestly, have any say, right? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3171.52s)]
*  You exert your pressure through the analyst [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3174.92s)]
*  who then represents the ability to influence [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3177.7599999999998s)]
*  your buying and selling decision. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3181.48s)]
*  But if those analysts don't even exist, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3182.7599999999998s)]
*  there is no feedback loop between management [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3185.04s)]
*  and that's the problem we have today. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3188.48s)]
*  There's not enough research coverage, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3190.52s)]
*  there's not enough analysts, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3192.12s)]
*  there's no organized way to keep companies held accountable. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3193.2799999999997s)]
*  And so if you have a bunch more companies that go public [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3197.92s)]
*  without that infrastructure, it's very difficult. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3200.44s)]
*  It seems like there's an opportunity somewhere in there. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3203.36s)]
*  You know the big opportunity that I think should happen [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3205.2799999999997s)]
*  is that a bunch of these banks [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3209.16s)]
*  should actually use these AI tools, Jason, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3210.72s)]
*  to be crawling all these 8Ks and 10Ks and all these filings [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3213.12s)]
*  statistical measurements of all of these public companies [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3217.92s)]
*  that they make free and available to everybody. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3222.0s)]
*  These things should be a bunch of dashboards and charts [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3224.24s)]
*  that are just out there for anybody to subscribe to [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3226.44s)]
*  so that you can just do the initial work [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3230.2799999999997s)]
*  of having to parse through all of these filings, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3234.12s)]
*  have it done by an AI, by an agent [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3236.2s)]
*  from a bank who can train it properly. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3239.68s)]
*  I think that would be an immense value to all shareholders. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3242.68s)]
*  And I don't think it costs that much money [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3245.52s)]
*  and I think it would be goodwill, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3247.08s)]
*  Robinhood could do this, it would be great goodwill [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3248.84s)]
*  to build a lot of trust and credibility with investors. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3251.7599999999998s)]
*  So now that you're CEO of a company, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3255.44s)]
*  how do you look long-term at potential exits going public? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3258.2s)]
*  What is the thoughts you have on this [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3261.48s)]
*  as you architect the company, Freeberg, as the CEO? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3264.2s)]
*  Do not care about exits. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3267.36s)]
*  Don't care about exits, expand on that, yeah, explain. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3269.4s)]
*  I just wanna build a great business [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3271.36s)]
*  that makes great products for our customers, that's it. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3273.08s)]
*  So if you do that, all these discussions around, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3276.0s)]
*  giving shareholders liquidity, I'm the main shareholder [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3280.92s)]
*  so I don't need liquidity, I just wanna build the business. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3283.92s)]
*  How do you think about profitability then? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3288.96s)]
*  Because if you have to fund it [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3290.72s)]
*  or funding might be harder to come by. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3292.08s)]
*  How do you think about funding over the next decade, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3295.44s)]
*  this vision you have? [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3297.8s)]
*  It freaks me out. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3299.12s)]
*  You gotta keep businesses capitalized. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3300.48s)]
*  So there's definitely across businesses [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3304.72s)]
*  I'm on the board of or involved in, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3309.3199999999997s)]
*  universally a bias towards profitability. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3311.68s)]
*  I've seen a couple of decisions we've made at some companies [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3315.8399999999997s)]
*  to shift from making longer time cycle investments [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3320.18s)]
*  that may not pay off for many years [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3326.2799999999997s)]
*  where you had the luxury of doing that [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3328.6s)]
*  in a zurp environment and you could always get capital [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3330.24s)]
*  to fund anything that's multiple years away [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3332.68s)]
*  from realizing any sort of return [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3335.2s)]
*  to shifting towards a bias towards making things [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3337.2s)]
*  that can generate real revenue and real profitability [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3340.56s)]
*  in the near term, keeping costs low and building from there. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3343.46s)]
*  So it's definitely, I'd say, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3347.08s)]
*  been a flip flop in the environment. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3348.48s)]
*  It's why the biotech landscape has largely kind of dried up. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3350.0s)]
*  The funding landscape has dried up significantly [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3353.48s)]
*  because most of the investment opportunities [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3355.6s)]
*  are those multi-year out before you know [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3358.24s)]
*  if you have a return on your investment [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3360.04s)]
*  kind of investment cycles. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3361.44s)]
*  And so the ones that do get funded [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3364.08s)]
*  are those that have a near path to profitability [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3365.48s)]
*  and where you can build some sort of [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3368.68s)]
*  cash generative service in the near term [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3370.2000000000003s)]
*  on the path to building a bigger product down the road. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3372.78s)]
*  So as you're strategizing, you're thinking [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3375.12s)]
*  how can we get to cash flow positive, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3377.2000000000003s)]
*  break even whatever quicker? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3378.88s)]
*  You're not strategizing how do I get a huge multiple [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3380.68s)]
*  and get some dumb tiger money, whatever, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3384.7200000000003s)]
*  no addicted tiger, but they paid the highest prices [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3387.16s)]
*  at the end of the cycle. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3389.12s)]
*  I've got enough wisdom at this point to tell you [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3389.96s)]
*  that if you don't have to raise venture capital, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3391.8s)]
*  you're better off. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3393.6s)]
*  Shamath, you also became a CEO. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3395.08s)]
*  I think it's Hustle is your company [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3397.44s)]
*  and that's profitable and you're running it. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3399.28s)]
*  I'm assuming for growth, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3402.4s)]
*  but maybe profit first then growth. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3404.56s)]
*  How do you think about those two dials? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3406.7200000000003s)]
*  How much growth, how much profits? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3408.8s)]
*  We have the same belief that Freebrick has, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3410.98s)]
*  which is our job is just to make [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3412.96s)]
*  really great products for our customers. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3414.2s)]
*  When I took over the business, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3417.04s)]
*  we had to go through a difficult layoff [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3420.16s)]
*  and a rebasing of the business, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3422.0s)]
*  but it's a business that's growing kind of 45% a year [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3423.36s)]
*  and it's profitable. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3427.44s)]
*  And what I talked to the team is that, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3429.16s)]
*  we will reinvest our profits. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3432.04s)]
*  And so we have an ambitious plan. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3434.16s)]
*  And as long as we meet that, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3436.24s)]
*  we'll take some percentage of that profit and reinvest it. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3437.36s)]
*  But I, like Freebrick also have no plans for liquidity. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3439.7599999999998s)]
*  I just wanna build this thing to be as big as possible. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3444.32s)]
*  And I don't want one single shred of pressure [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3447.2s)]
*  that isn't defined by our customers. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3452.3999999999996s)]
*  And so by being profitable, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3454.12s)]
*  we have complete control of the cap table. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3455.48s)]
*  We can do whatever we want. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3457.24s)]
*  And the people that benefit frankly are the employees [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3458.44s)]
*  because they can get paid and our ability to hire people [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3461.72s)]
*  without being subject to like pressure to raise a new round [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3464.7599999999998s)]
*  and set a new random valuation. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3467.44s)]
*  So no unnatural acts, just customer profits. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3469.72s)]
*  And so by the way, if I can grow for 10 years, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3473.08s)]
*  if we can grow for 10 years at 40% a year, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3475.12s)]
*  this will be a ginormous business. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3477.76s)]
*  So no trying to three acts and do it unnaturally. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3478.6s)]
*  Jason, just to chime back on the question [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3481.36s)]
*  you asked a couple of minutes ago. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3484.88s)]
*  Number one, if you can avoid raising capital, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3486.44s)]
*  you're better off. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3488.64s)]
*  Cause then you don't have any shareholder pressure [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3489.84s)]
*  to get liquid. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3492.88s)]
*  And that can create contortions in what you do [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3495.44s)]
*  and how you operate the business. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3498.04s)]
*  And second is, if you're gonna raise capital, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3499.2400000000002s)]
*  if you set too high evaluation, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3503.52s)]
*  if that becomes the bogey, you set yourself up [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3505.12s)]
*  for challenges because now you've gotta have a multiple [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3507.12s)]
*  on that valuation to satisfy investor return hurdles. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3509.6s)]
*  And the higher the valuation and you apply a multiple [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3513.48s)]
*  to that, the higher the exit has to be. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3517.96s)]
*  And suddenly all the options start to fade away. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3519.92s)]
*  You can no longer have a modest exit that can do really well [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3522.52s)]
*  for employees and the founders and early investors. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3525.6s)]
*  And it becomes a necessity that you have a massive outcome. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3528.88s)]
*  And by the way, we see this now [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3532.52s)]
*  in this post-Zerp environment that a lot of businesses [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3534.68s)]
*  that raised a lot of capital at a very high valuation. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3537.16s)]
*  And then you have this multiple compression [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3540.4s)]
*  that's just happened in the last two years. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3542.08s)]
*  Their valuation effectively, if they were to go public [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3544.6s)]
*  today or get sold is less than the capital they've raised. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3546.84s)]
*  And that's the most extreme scenario where, you know, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3549.36s)]
*  suddenly all the common shareholders get wiped out [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3552.04s)]
*  in terms of their return. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3554.12s)]
*  It's such a great point. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3555.16s)]
*  Like the thing that people used to say was, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3556.08s)]
*  oh, it's a tech company. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3558.12s)]
*  So we need to give it a premium. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3559.6s)]
*  The problem is now everything's a tech company. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3561.8s)]
*  To say you're a tech company is a meaningless statement [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3564.2000000000003s)]
*  that means nothing. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3566.36s)]
*  You're a company. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3567.32s)]
*  So that you're a company. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3568.2400000000002s)]
*  So then there's no premium for being a company. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3569.2400000000002s)]
*  No, there's a premium for profits. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3572.28s)]
*  Well, there's a premium based on quality of revenue, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3574.36s)]
*  which has to do with gross margins. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3577.32s)]
*  I mean, obviously in economics, obviously a company [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3578.7200000000003s)]
*  that has 80% gross margins is different than a company [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3581.96s)]
*  that has 20% gross margins. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3585.32s)]
*  Not if it's unprofitable. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3586.32s)]
*  Well, no, no, no, I totally get that. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3587.88s)]
*  I'm just saying that you can normalize based on gross margin [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3589.4s)]
*  as opposed to the type of company it is. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3593.7200000000003s)]
*  Sometimes we'll see a company that markets itself [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3596.1200000000003s)]
*  as a tech company and only has 20% gross margins. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3598.08s)]
*  That's an indication that something is wrong usually, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3600.6s)]
*  or it's not truly a software company. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3603.2000000000003s)]
*  It's just a company. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3605.0s)]
*  That's just a company. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3605.84s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's the way to look at it. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3606.6800000000003s)]
*  High gross margin versus lower gross margin. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3608.04s)]
*  Just to go back and answer your question, J. Cal, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3610.7200000000003s)]
*  about how do you decide how much money to put into growth [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3612.48s)]
*  versus being profitable? [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3615.88s)]
*  I think the right answer to that is not to say [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3618.48s)]
*  there's some absolute amount of money you should burn [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3620.72s)]
*  given you're around. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3622.8s)]
*  It's to look at growth on an ROI basis [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3624.04s)]
*  or union economics basis. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3627.2s)]
*  What is the return on the growth dollars you're spending? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3628.52s)]
*  And probably the best way to do that is to look at the payback [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3631.76s)]
*  on customer acquisition. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3635.32s)]
*  How long does it take you to pay back your customer [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3636.44s)]
*  acquisition costs? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3639.16s)]
*  And I think a lot of people don't do that analysis [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3640.6s)]
*  correctly because they just look at the revenue they [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3643.0s)]
*  make from that customer. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3645.6s)]
*  But you actually have to look at the marginal profit. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3647.28s)]
*  So this is how the gross margin ties in. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3649.7200000000003s)]
*  Easy example is something like Spotify. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3651.48s)]
*  Spotify, it costs $100 a year, and they [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3653.32s)]
*  would acquire somebody for $100 a year. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3655.8s)]
*  Hey, they get to year two. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3657.52s)]
*  It looks like you made $100. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3658.2400000000002s)]
*  Except Spotify has to pay a massive amount [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3659.4s)]
*  to the record label so their margin isn't [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3662.0s)]
*  as high as maybe a SaaS company. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3664.1200000000003s)]
*  And that's where the devil's in the details. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3665.7200000000003s)]
*  And overhead. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3667.52s)]
*  And overhead. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3668.36s)]
*  You've got to look at churn as well. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3669.1200000000003s)]
*  So if that customer only lasts two years [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3670.88s)]
*  and half the margin goes to the record companies, [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3674.64s)]
*  well, you can't count 100% of revenue. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3678.2799999999997s)]
*  Now you're looking at, I don't know what's that. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3680.96s)]
*  You're dividing by two twice. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3683.0s)]
*  So it's effectively a quarter. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3684.24s)]
*  $50 of the $200, let's say, in which to make a number. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3686.64s)]
*  What are you seeing in the companies you're funding? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3689.0s)]
*  You're seeing profitable companies or revenue generating [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3691.2s)]
*  companies? [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3694.24s)]
*  Are you telling folks you've got to grow and raise [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3695.04s)]
*  a big series A? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3697.08s)]
*  Or are you telling folks, hey, take your time and? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3697.72s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3700.08s)]
*  We invested in 100 companies this year. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3701.52s)]
*  It's more than I've ever done. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3703.28s)]
*  That's the same amount I did in the first seven [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3704.6000000000004s)]
*  years of my career. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3706.5600000000004s)]
*  And 100% of the time, they are not [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3707.52s)]
*  expecting to raise some giant seed or series A. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3709.6000000000004s)]
*  They're raising just the amount of money they need. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3713.0800000000004s)]
*  And they're keeping their expenses absurdly low. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3715.36s)]
*  The biggest trend I'm seeing is outsourcing of talent. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3719.4s)]
*  And so Americans, and I'm not going [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3723.0s)]
*  to make this a huge anti-American thing, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3725.1600000000003s)]
*  but the level of entitlement and the effort Americans [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3726.88s)]
*  are putting into jobs, expecting 150k, let's say, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3730.08s)]
*  and then offshoring a developer, Latin America, Portugal, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3733.2799999999997s)]
*  keeps coming up, Canada. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3737.88s)]
*  They're all looking for what's the most efficient way for me [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3739.12s)]
*  to build a 10-person team. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3741.5s)]
*  And then I'll see a burn rate of $30,000 with 10 people. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3742.6s)]
*  How is that possible? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3745.6s)]
*  Oh, our developers cost $22,000. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3746.72s)]
*  SDRs are 10. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3749.24s)]
*  How is that possible? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3750.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, we have two people in Manila, et cetera. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3751.16s)]
*  Wrong way of saying efficiency, efficiency, efficiency. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3752.56s)]
*  We have to get to break even with the money we just got. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3755.16s)]
*  We're not expecting a second round of funding. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3757.52s)]
*  And a lot of them are raising but 500k to 1.5 million. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3759.48s)]
*  And if this was 2020, it would be 3 to 10. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3764.88s)]
*  We talk about AI as a big disruptor [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3767.76s)]
*  to the big companies and this and that. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3770.2400000000002s)]
*  But AI may be the biggest disruptor to VC in the end. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3772.12s)]
*  Big time. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3774.44s)]
*  Explain what you mean. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3774.94s)]
*  I know what you mean, but I want the audience to understand. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3776.0s)]
*  Let's just say you raise a $2 million seed round. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3777.68s)]
*  In the past, what you would do, to your point, Jason, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3780.56s)]
*  is you would hire seven people at $200,000 each. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3783.02s)]
*  So now you have a $1.4 million burn. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3788.88s)]
*  So you basically have, and let's just say you [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3791.32s)]
*  co-work someplace, you have a year and a half. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3794.04s)]
*  And so you're a pedal to the metal. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3796.12s)]
*  You're basically trying to throw as much spaghetti [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3799.44s)]
*  against the wall as possible. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3802.6400000000003s)]
*  See what sticks. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3803.8s)]
*  Buy as many ads. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3804.8s)]
*  Do whatever it takes. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3806.2000000000003s)]
*  The money basically goes to AWS and Facebook [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3807.44s)]
*  and a couple of other companies to Google. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3810.54s)]
*  And then you hope that there's enough traction where somebody [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3813.4s)]
*  then writes you a $10 or $15 million Series A check. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3815.96s)]
*  Now, if you take that same $2 million, [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3819.96s)]
*  you could have a three-person team, four-person team, half [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3822.88s)]
*  of them offshore, where they also [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3826.92s)]
*  use things like Co-Pilot, which is like a 2 to 3x lever. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3830.0s)]
*  Now all of a sudden, they have the same 10-person team, [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3833.88s)]
*  and it costs $40,000. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3836.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3839.68s)]
*  And so now all of a sudden, they have four years. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3840.2s)]
*  So why wouldn't they do that where they would still [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3843.44s)]
*  own 80% of that company, and all of a sudden, [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3845.84s)]
*  there is a potential to exit it for $50 million or $100 million, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3849.52s)]
*  and they've made more money than a traditional outcome [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3853.1200000000003s)]
*  if you sold it for $2 billion? [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3856.4s)]
*  Precisely the case. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3857.6000000000004s)]
*  This is literally what founders are modeling right now. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3858.6000000000004s)]
*  They previously wanted to beat the record of the person [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3861.48s)]
*  in their cohort who raised the most money at the highest [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3865.32s)]
*  valuation. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3867.92s)]
*  Now they're just like, how do I get to profitability, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3868.92s)]
*  and how do I own as much of my company as possible? [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3871.04s)]
*  So you've got a lot of cash in your stocks. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3873.2s)]
*  You've got over $1 billion under management. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3875.6s)]
*  You've been one of the most successful new venture [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3877.8799999999997s)]
*  firms in Silicon Valley in the last decade. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3880.2s)]
*  You've got a lot of cash you could deploy. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3883.2799999999997s)]
*  How do you deploy it intelligently [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3885.4399999999996s)]
*  given the circumstance of people maybe raising less [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3888.16s)]
*  or being more efficient? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3892.0s)]
*  And what do you think of the AI's impact on venture? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3893.0s)]
*  Well, the most important thing is [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3897.48s)]
*  to have opportunities to invest in. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3898.9199999999996s)]
*  Before this AI wave, the whole cloud social mobile wave [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3900.68s)]
*  had kind of petered out. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3905.36s)]
*  The pond of opportunities had kind of been fished out. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3907.08s)]
*  And AI is great because it restocks the pond. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3910.96s)]
*  There is a lot of new ways for founders [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3914.68s)]
*  to use these advancements to solve problems [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3918.4s)]
*  that they weren't addressing before. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3920.72s)]
*  So I think you guys are being a little too gloomy. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3922.52s)]
*  I think that the impact on capital efficiency [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3925.72s)]
*  will take some time to play out. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3929.36s)]
*  But I think that for the first time in a number of years, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3930.6s)]
*  everything's feeling fresh again. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3935.48s)]
*  And there's just, I think, a lot more opportunities [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3936.88s)]
*  for founders to go after now. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3939.96s)]
*  It's like this at the beginning of any big new tech wave, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3941.76s)]
*  is this is a new platform opportunity. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3945.1200000000003s)]
*  Same thing was true with the App Store [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3947.32s)]
*  when the iPhone launched. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3949.76s)]
*  Same thing was true when the internet launched. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3950.8s)]
*  Now, I understand a lot of these opportunities [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3952.6s)]
*  are going to be taken by big companies that already exist. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3954.8s)]
*  But there's always going to be an opportunity for founders [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3957.28s)]
*  when you have a big disruption. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3960.6800000000003s)]
*  David, I agree with you. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3961.88s)]
*  My comment is less about the pond. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3963.0400000000004s)]
*  I agree with you that the pond is getting restocked. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3965.6000000000004s)]
*  My comment is that the economic impact of AI [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3968.0s)]
*  is so massively deflationary. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3971.44s)]
*  It may be an order or two orders of magnitude [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3973.7200000000003s)]
*  more deflationary than AWS was. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3977.36s)]
*  And that was massively accretive to the startup economy. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3981.2000000000003s)]
*  So if this is a 10Xing or a 100Xing of that economic impact, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3985.0s)]
*  my only point is that the breakeven threshold [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3989.36s)]
*  for a founder will have gone way down. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3992.56s)]
*  And then as a result, it's only a matter of time [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3995.56s)]
*  until they can put two and two together [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3998.32s)]
*  in an Excel spreadsheet to figure out [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=3999.84s)]
*  that owning 50% of a $100 million company [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4001.88s)]
*  is greater than owning 18% of some other company [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4005.16s)]
*  when you're massively diluted, or 8% or whatever. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4010.12s)]
*  It's just like, that's all I'm saying, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4012.64s)]
*  the effective breakeven goes way down [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4014.92s)]
*  in a world where AI proliferates. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4018.56s)]
*  And I think that's positive for... [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4020.16s)]
*  Yeah, what do you think of that? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4021.48s)]
*  Saxon. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4022.92s)]
*  It's just positive for founders. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4023.7599999999998s)]
*  If you look at what founders do with the money [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4024.72s)]
*  when we invest in a series A or B, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4027.92s)]
*  the number one thing is go to market. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4030.52s)]
*  So they wanna basically triple their sales. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4032.72s)]
*  Let's say they wanna grow from 5 million of ARR [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4034.4s)]
*  to 15 million of ARR. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4036.12s)]
*  They have to staff up the quota capacity to hit that number. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4038.3199999999997s)]
*  And for every AE, you're gonna need some number of FDR, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4042.4s)]
*  some sort of management, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4046.84s)]
*  you're gonna need some sort of operations overhead. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4048.76s)]
*  So you've gotta hire all of that. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4051.28s)]
*  And then they want there to be a cushion [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4052.6800000000003s)]
*  in case they miss their numbers, right? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4055.4s)]
*  Because there's no guarantee you're gonna hit that. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4057.04s)]
*  So founders still need to raise the money to staff up [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4059.0s)]
*  to go after that opportunity. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4062.56s)]
*  Now, does sales become more efficient over time [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4063.88s)]
*  because of AI or does lead gen? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4067.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's possible. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4069.08s)]
*  But in order for that to happen, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4070.8s)]
*  you're gonna need to see a rise in quota capacity, right? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4072.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, that's what we're talking about is that [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4076.6800000000003s)]
*  that same AE can now hit a greater level of sales [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4078.36s)]
*  because they have better tooling. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4083.04s)]
*  We're just not there yet. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4084.44s)]
*  Maybe that happens over time. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4085.4s)]
*  But I think your typical SaaS star- [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4087.1200000000003s)]
*  It's inevitable. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4089.5600000000004s)]
*  It's inevitable, but I just think your typical SaaS star [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4090.6800000000003s)]
*  right now is spending the money on more prosaic things. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4093.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4096.320000000001s)]
*  No, I think you're right. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4097.400000000001s)]
*  All I'm saying is I think what it means is that [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4098.24s)]
*  the $200 million fund today becomes 50. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4101.76s)]
*  The $500 million fund needs to be 100 [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4105.16s)]
*  and the billion dollar fund needs to be 200. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4107.24s)]
*  It's basically back to the future. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4109.0s)]
*  It's like back to the 1990s style. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4110.8s)]
*  2012. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4113.4800000000005s)]
*  By the way, I'll show you a table here. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4114.6s)]
*  Nick, I need you to blur out the names, okay? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4116.76s)]
*  I just think it's super interesting. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4119.08s)]
*  I walked Friedberg through this, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4120.76s)]
*  but this was like a list of all these funds [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4121.88s)]
*  that I've invested in. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4124.0s)]
*  These are venture funds you've invested in. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4125.04s)]
*  These are all the venture funds I've invested in. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4126.8s)]
*  If you look at this, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4128.280000000001s)]
*  what do you notice about the mega funds [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4130.04s)]
*  that just clock out DPI? [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4132.24s)]
*  Look, this is a $100 million fund, right? [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4134.16s)]
*  Look at, clocked it. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4137.28s)]
*  This was a $220 million fund. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4140.72s)]
*  My point in all of this is if I look at my returns as an LP, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4145.0s)]
*  I've never had success when I've invested in big funds. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4149.2s)]
*  I've only had success in small funds. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4151.84s)]
*  It's true that smaller funds do perform better [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4153.96s)]
*  and larger funds become more of an index [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4156.28s)]
*  and achieve more average returns. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4158.2s)]
*  When you've got a multi-billion dollar fund, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4160.400000000001s)]
*  it's way harder to achieve a outsized return. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4161.84s)]
*  So yeah, I agree with you. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4165.08s)]
*  I think this dynamic would be healthy. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4166.96s)]
*  I mean, our funds actually are not that big [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4168.92s)]
*  in the grand scheme of things. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4170.64s)]
*  It's definitely the game is changing dynamically [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4171.8s)]
*  and this podcast is gonna be great in 2024 [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4173.84s)]
*  because we went from four capital allocators [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4176.12s)]
*  to two capital allocators, myself and Sax, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4177.88s)]
*  to two in the arena CEOs. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4180.320000000001s)]
*  So we're gonna be having this discussion, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4182.4400000000005s)]
*  I think in a very granular way, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4183.88s)]
*  now that we got two players on the field, Sax, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4185.84s)]
*  that we can watch what they're doing. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4188.56s)]
*  Well, I've got a new incubation [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4189.84s)]
*  that's gonna be launching soon. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4191.360000000001s)]
*  But I'm not gonna be CEO of it, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4194.76s)]
*  but I'm kind of executive chairman. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4196.0s)]
*  Is it a SaaS company? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4200.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's a SaaS company. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4202.0s)]
*  What kind of company is SaaS? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4203.280000000001s)]
*  It's basically Yammer 2.0. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4205.160000000001s)]
*  You have our attention. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4206.0s)]
*  Wait, so you say Yammer 2.0? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4208.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4210.080000000001s)]
*  I thought that was Slack. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4210.92s)]
*  So this would be- [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4212.0s)]
*  Yeah, you gotta say Yammer 3.0. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4212.84s)]
*  I'm getting Yammer 3.0. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4213.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's Yammer 3.0. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4214.92s)]
*  Okay, let's go. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4216.88s)]
*  Let's get a little, yeah, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4217.72s)]
*  I think we had a push on call-ins, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4219.92s)]
*  so now we need to get our 50X on Yammer 3.0. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4221.68s)]
*  Give us a little tasty poo for your best- [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4225.68s)]
*  No, you're right, we sold call-ins, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4227.2s)]
*  so now we've cleared the decks, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4228.280000000001s)]
*  and I can't work on multiple incubations. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4230.280000000001s)]
*  I can only work on one at a time. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4232.8s)]
*  Can you have your person that runs that SaaS grid thing [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4234.56s)]
*  email me, because I wanna onboard my company into SaaS grid. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4238.16s)]
*  Yeah, dude, it's so good. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4240.84s)]
*  Well, by the way, that was the last one. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4242.320000000001s)]
*  So I've done, I guess, three of these now. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4243.52s)]
*  There's call-in, SaaS grid. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4246.0s)]
*  So SaaS grid has now spun out completely of Kraft, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4248.04s)]
*  and the founder of SaaS grid was our VP of analytics [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4251.24s)]
*  at Kraft, and now he's going full-time to SaaS grid. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4255.639999999999s)]
*  So I think it's been very successful. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4259.32s)]
*  But can I get onboarded, [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4260.879999999999s)]
*  and can I get a friends and family discount? [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4262.2s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, of course. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4264.44s)]
*  Let's explain this concept to the audience, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4265.28s)]
*  since it's unique in the world, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4267.28s)]
*  and we should maybe double-click on the economics, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4268.719999999999s)]
*  not on a specific company's acts, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4271.879999999999s)]
*  but just generally why VCs are doing this. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4273.08s)]
*  You're incubating a company, you're a former founder, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4276.24s)]
*  you have that itch, you have ideas. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4278.84s)]
*  So instead of investing in a company, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4280.5599999999995s)]
*  you say, hey, let's all get to the office. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4282.4s)]
*  I have an idea, let's make this ourselves as Kraft, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4283.8s)]
*  and then we'll put some of Kraft's LPs money into it. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4287.96s)]
*  And then there's some slug of capital [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4291.5199999999995s)]
*  saved for the new team that comes. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4294.48s)]
*  So how does the economics on something like this work, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4296.719999999999s)]
*  and why do LPs love it, or do they love it? [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4298.639999999999s)]
*  And then why is it good for your internal team, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4301.28s)]
*  or for you to incubate a company, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4303.76s)]
*  or are they supposed to just find them? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4305.6s)]
*  Well, when I first set up Kraft, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4307.240000000001s)]
*  we actually wrote it into our LPA [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4309.4800000000005s)]
*  that we had the ability to incubate companies, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4311.160000000001s)]
*  and we had a prearranged economic deal [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4313.200000000001s)]
*  with our LPs on those incubations, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4315.52s)]
*  because I didn't want it to come up later, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4317.400000000001s)]
*  and then there's some conflict of interest [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4319.6s)]
*  between the management company and the LPs. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4321.56s)]
*  So it's a predetermined deal. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4323.76s)]
*  And we don't do a lot of these. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4326.0s)]
*  Like I said, I guess there's been three. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4327.200000000001s)]
*  There's been SAS Grid, call in and out, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4328.96s)]
*  this Yammer 3.0 we're talking about. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4331.360000000001s)]
*  But really, I got to give the credit for SAS Grid [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4334.16s)]
*  to our VP of analytics, who really, I think, [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4336.24s)]
*  pushed this idea. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4338.639999999999s)]
*  And it started with a simple way for us to analyze deals [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4339.48s)]
*  and dashboard deals. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4342.88s)]
*  It started as a spreadsheet that we [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4344.04s)]
*  would give founders that would crank out their charts. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4345.84s)]
*  And then we turned it into a website that was free. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4349.0s)]
*  And then we realized, what is this? [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4351.28s)]
*  You needed it as an investor, right? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4352.599999999999s)]
*  You needed it as an investor. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4353.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we just needed this as an investor. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4354.72s)]
*  And then what happened is that we [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4356.5199999999995s)]
*  saw founders started using SAS Grid as their dashboard [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4358.72s)]
*  to manage their companies between funding rounds. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4363.44s)]
*  And we're like, oh, OK. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4365.5199999999995s)]
*  That's a big aha moment. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4366.719999999999s)]
*  So basically, there was no dedicated, [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4368.599999999999s)]
*  verticalized business intelligence tool [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4370.879999999999s)]
*  or dashboarding tool just for SAS companies. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4373.0s)]
*  And the advantages of verticalizing [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4376.0s)]
*  are massive because when you know what kind of company it [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4377.919999999999s)]
*  is, you can just give them all the dashboards out of the box. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4380.719999999999s)]
*  And all the formulas can be calculated exactly the right [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4383.879999999999s)]
*  way. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4386.599999999999s)]
*  This is going to be less room for error. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4387.12s)]
*  They don't have to reinvent the wheel every time [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4388.719999999999s)]
*  and make mistakes. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4390.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's if you use something like Tableau or Looker, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4391.5199999999995s)]
*  whatever, you're reinventing the wheel. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4392.72s)]
*  You're writing all the formulas yourself. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4394.320000000001s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4395.6s)]
*  So back to the deal. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4396.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4397.400000000001s)]
*  You pre-did the deal, so LPs wouldn't be surprised. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4398.320000000001s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4400.76s)]
*  So the management, there's a predetermined valuation, [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4401.72s)]
*  I guess, at that seed stage. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4404.56s)]
*  A certain amount of money goes in. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4405.76s)]
*  And your holding company gets some equity, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4407.2s)]
*  which is like a nice little extra icing on the cake [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4409.16s)]
*  for incubating it. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4412.4400000000005s)]
*  And then the LPs get a sweetheart deal or a better deal. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4413.320000000001s)]
*  Is that why they would be in favor of it? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4415.6s)]
*  Yeah, the LPs get basically a VIG in the startup. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4417.360000000001s)]
*  Got it. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4421.400000000001s)]
*  We kind of modeled it after YC's original deal, right? [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4422.04s)]
*  Where YC got, what is it, 7% for $100,000. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4424.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4428.6s)]
*  And then on top of that, the fund [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4429.16s)]
*  can invest in the seed round at the market valuation, whatever [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4431.28s)]
*  the market. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4434.84s)]
*  OK, so they get basically 7% for free or something [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4435.64s)]
*  in that range. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4438.16s)]
*  7% for $100,000, then plus whatever the seed round's [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4438.72s)]
*  going to be. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4441.68s)]
*  Brilliant. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4442.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4442.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4443.28s)]
*  I think it's a good deal for them. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4443.68s)]
*  And also, it's good for you, because you [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4445.24s)]
*  have to want to come to work every day. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4446.5199999999995s)]
*  And this keeps you mentally engaged. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4448.12s)]
*  Like Shemath said, he felt like he was becoming a talking head [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4449.88s)]
*  and just not, I don't know how you phrase it [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4453.04s)]
*  exactly in your newsletter. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4454.96s)]
*  Well, like you said, scratch is an itch. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4456.4400000000005s)]
*  It's nice to be able to, if you have an idea for a product, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4458.24s)]
*  you can work creatively on it. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4461.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4463.36s)]
*  I don't want to run companies anymore. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4464.04s)]
*  I don't have any desire to be CEO. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4465.68s)]
*  But it is fun to work on products if you have an idea. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4467.92s)]
*  Shemath, how has it been for the first couple of months now? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4470.36s)]
*  Are you really feeling more intellectually curious [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4473.68s)]
*  and challenged? [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4477.6s)]
*  Is it annoying to deal with employees and customers [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4478.76s)]
*  and all that kind of stuff? [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4483.24s)]
*  What's it been like? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4484.56s)]
*  I think you've been at six months, I think. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4485.52s)]
*  It's been really challenging. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4487.52s)]
*  The first part of it was quite honestly, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4490.04s)]
*  we had to rebase the cost basis of the company [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4491.64s)]
*  and get costs under control. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4497.360000000001s)]
*  That's hard. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4499.52s)]
*  And we had to lay some good people off. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4500.64s)]
*  And then we had to kind of like reset the strategy, right, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4504.320000000001s)]
*  get our goals, get our values kind of in a good place, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4506.84s)]
*  reorient the organizational design, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4511.360000000001s)]
*  like who will do what, right? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4513.400000000001s)]
*  All of these things require just enormous amounts of time [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4515.56s)]
*  that where you don't see necessarily [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4518.92s)]
*  the obvious impact in a metric or a dashboard right away. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4522.320000000001s)]
*  And so you just have to commit to this process [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4525.52s)]
*  and really follow through in it. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4527.84s)]
*  You have to find the people that have this real potential, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4529.64s)]
*  elevate them, make decisions quickly, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4532.04s)]
*  find out you made some wrong, undo them, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4534.2s)]
*  find out you made some right, double down on them. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4536.92s)]
*  So it's been a real learning process. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4540.44s)]
*  And then on top of all that, I've [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4542.48s)]
*  tried to start coding again. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4544.16s)]
*  Sunny helped me a lot. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4547.24s)]
*  I built a couple models. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4548.5199999999995s)]
*  You were paraprogramming. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4550.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, but then I did that to go back [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4551.84s)]
*  into our all hands, which we do every week. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4553.88s)]
*  And I wanted to demo some stuff, mostly just [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4555.8s)]
*  to set the values that we're all grinding here. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4559.0s)]
*  And I'm here grinding and learning this stuff [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4562.36s)]
*  like anybody else. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4564.96s)]
*  And it's embarrassing because it's janky code. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4566.0s)]
*  It doesn't work and blah, blah, blah. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4568.5599999999995s)]
*  But it's been really, I think in the long run, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4571.599999999999s)]
*  I think the company is a lovely business. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4575.32s)]
*  And I want them to be successful because I [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4577.24s)]
*  think they deserve to be successful. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4579.4s)]
*  And for me, it's been a great outlet [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4581.0s)]
*  to just get back to the basics of what really matters [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4584.04s)]
*  in running a company in 2023. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4587.96s)]
*  I don't think I really knew the details. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4589.64s)]
*  That's good. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4592.8s)]
*  And I'm finding them out. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4593.320000000001s)]
*  A little humbling, perhaps. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4594.08s)]
*  A little humbling to get in there and be in the cockpit. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4594.96s)]
*  Really, really humbling. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4597.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's good. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4598.280000000001s)]
*  Yesterday, we were sitting there in E-Team, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4598.76s)]
*  which is our executive team. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4600.6s)]
*  And we're in the middle of a big deal. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4601.72s)]
*  And the seven of us were redlining a contract back. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4603.4800000000005s)]
*  And I know that may sound like really tactical stuff. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4607.68s)]
*  But for me, it was amazing. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4609.84s)]
*  I'm like, this is great work. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4611.6s)]
*  And I felt like I accomplished something when it was done. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4613.04s)]
*  And maybe the deal gets closed today. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4615.4400000000005s)]
*  The team is on the call. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4617.84s)]
*  And I just think it's wonderful. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4618.96s)]
*  I get a real feeling. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4620.28s)]
*  That's awesome. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4620.88s)]
*  All right, listen. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4621.6s)]
*  There's another story that is under-reported. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4622.24s)]
*  We're trying to find these under-reported stories, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4625.16s)]
*  things people are talking about in their group chats, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4627.12s)]
*  but maybe not reading about or hearing about [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4629.64s)]
*  in the mainstream media or even on social media. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4633.4800000000005s)]
*  There are a couple of unbelievable bombshell class [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4636.36s)]
*  action lawsuits that are dropping in the United States [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4639.56s)]
*  regarding our real estate industry. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4643.52s)]
*  In October, a federal jury in Missouri [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4645.0s)]
*  found the NAR, that's the National Association of Realtors, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4647.52s)]
*  and several of the brokerages that have those brokers [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4650.52s)]
*  working for them guilty of conspiring to artificially [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4654.52s)]
*  inflate commissions for home sales. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4657.080000000001s)]
*  They now have to pay at least $1.8 billion in damages [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4659.8s)]
*  to sellers of more than 260,000 homes between 2015 and 2022. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4664.120000000001s)]
*  This is gonna bankrupt the NAR. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4669.120000000001s)]
*  And if you don't know what a racket this is, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4670.8s)]
*  people selling homes in the United States [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4673.72s)]
*  pay 6% commissions on average, 3% for the seller. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4675.12s)]
*  That's if you own the home and you're selling it, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4679.44s)]
*  you give them 3% of the sale. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4681.12s)]
*  And then the buyer, you also give them 3%. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4683.0s)]
*  And there have been a number of companies like Redfin [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4686.36s)]
*  who have tried to change this. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4689.72s)]
*  I actually used Renfit on a transaction [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4691.32s)]
*  and tried to use them on a sale. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4693.32s)]
*  And I was faced with brokers who, I kid you not, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4694.76s)]
*  literally said, I'm not gonna show your home [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4698.92s)]
*  because it's a lower commission rate [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4700.599999999999s)]
*  and they have been working in unison [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4703.72s)]
*  to try to stop this kind of innovation. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4706.400000000001s)]
*  But the 6% is a tradition, it's not a rule. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4708.12s)]
*  You can actually negotiate it. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4710.92s)]
*  And now since this case got won, [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4712.64s)]
*  another couple of cases have been dropped. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4714.84s)]
*  And these new class action lawsuits all put together [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4718.04s)]
*  could be $13 billion in damages. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4721.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know who's been following this in the group, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4725.4800000000005s)]
*  but I have a lot to say about it. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4727.84s)]
*  But, Tomas Freberg. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4729.68s)]
*  I spent a bunch of time looking at this [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4731.5199999999995s)]
*  because I've done several [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4734.16s)]
*  no broker real estate transactions. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4736.24s)]
*  Oh, just lawyers. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4739.08s)]
*  Yeah, just lawyers. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4741.44s)]
*  And then in California, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4743.44s)]
*  I don't know if you guys know this thing called MLS, [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4745.639999999999s)]
*  the Multiple Listing Service. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4747.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4748.96s)]
*  Which feeds the data into Redfin and Zillow. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4749.799999999999s)]
*  And in order to list a property on MLS, [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4753.32s)]
*  you have to have one of these real estate licenses [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4755.639999999999s)]
*  and be a member of National Association of Realtors. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4757.639999999999s)]
*  Part of the monopolistic racket that goes on [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4760.16s)]
*  is that you have to be a licensed broker [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4764.08s)]
*  in order to list your home on the service [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4765.599999999999s)]
*  that is the monopoly in the listing of homes, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4767.88s)]
*  which everyone looks at. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4770.5199999999995s)]
*  So there's a bunch of folks who have set up [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4771.48s)]
*  a listing service where you can list your home directly [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4773.5599999999995s)]
*  on MLS. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4776.08s)]
*  And basically it's a guy who has a brokerage license [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4777.08s)]
*  and you pay him a hundred bucks [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4780.16s)]
*  and he just has a website set up and then you'll list it. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4781.72s)]
*  And so you can kind of just list your own home, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4783.68s)]
*  post the photos and all the docs. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4785.72s)]
*  And then when the agent asks for disclosures, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4787.72s)]
*  every disclosure they wanna see [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4790.96s)]
*  on a National Association of Realtors form. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4792.92s)]
*  And the NAR forms are only available if you're a member. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4795.6s)]
*  So there's a whole bunch of ways [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4799.240000000001s)]
*  that they've tied up the market and made it impossible [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4801.12s)]
*  for the system to operate without the NAR members [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4804.6s)]
*  being a key principle in the transaction process. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4807.96s)]
*  When at the end of the day, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4811.56s)]
*  having gone through this a number of times myself, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4812.4400000000005s)]
*  there's just all these templates and data [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4814.64s)]
*  that flows into this. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4816.16s)]
*  There's no reason why you necessarily need to [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4817.24s)]
*  have an individual that needs to be involved here. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4821.72s)]
*  But if you did, it's actually a data entry service. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4825.24s)]
*  The process of entering this data could probably reduce down [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4828.36s)]
*  to a fixed fee of call it a couple thousand bucks per home [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4831.5199999999995s)]
*  rather than a percentage of the home value. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4834.5599999999995s)]
*  And by the way, think about the craziness around this. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4836.5599999999995s)]
*  If you buy a home and you sell it, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4838.4s)]
*  in most parts of the United States, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4841.32s)]
*  you actually have a tax that you have to pay [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4842.8s)]
*  that's a percentage of the gross. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4844.2s)]
*  And most people have most of their net worth [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4845.36s)]
*  tied up in their real estate. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4846.8s)]
*  So it's one of the few places where you will actually see [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4848.04s)]
*  a large chunk of your net worth actually taxed [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4850.2s)]
*  on a gross basis and taken away from you [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4853.0s)]
*  if you end up selling it rather than on a net basis, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4855.360000000001s)]
*  meaning net of the profit you make. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4857.400000000001s)]
*  And then the brokers wanna get paid [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4859.52s)]
*  a percentage of the gross as well. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4860.96s)]
*  These are the commissions they get paid. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4862.360000000001s)]
*  From a first principles perspective, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4863.72s)]
*  it doesn't make sense that we're paying a percentage [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4865.24s)]
*  of the gross to agencies to transact this volume. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4866.96s)]
*  The total volume in the US is an incredible number. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4870.4800000000005s)]
*  It's $100 billion a year [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4872.6s)]
*  in residential real estate commissions. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4873.88s)]
*  And there's 1.6 million folks who are real estate agents [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4875.72s)]
*  that are licensed making their living doing this. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4878.400000000001s)]
*  So it's not an inconsequential industry [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4880.8s)]
*  and it's not an inconsequential verdict. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4882.88s)]
*  Nick, if you could pull up that chart [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4885.12s)]
*  of the different countries, here's a good comparison. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4887.12s)]
*  So in the US, we pay about 5.5% brokerage commission [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4890.08s)]
*  split between the buyer and the seller's broker. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4894.400000000001s)]
*  And again, legally, you don't need a buyer's broker. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4897.64s)]
*  You don't need a seller's broker. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4900.0s)]
*  You're allowed to sell your home without a broker. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4901.400000000001s)]
*  There's nothing in the law that prevents you from doing that. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4903.400000000001s)]
*  So this is just an industry that's popped up [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4906.360000000001s)]
*  to service this need. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4907.84s)]
*  And their pricing model is to take a percentage [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4909.72s)]
*  of the gross. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4911.96s)]
*  And that's just the way the market's developed. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4912.8s)]
*  But in a competitive market, that should be competed away. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4914.64s)]
*  And it hasn't been because of this behavior [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4918.040000000001s)]
*  that's gone on with institutions like the NAR. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4920.900000000001s)]
*  And you can see across different countries, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4923.4400000000005s)]
*  different pricing systems as a percentage of gross. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4925.740000000001s)]
*  In the UK, you only pay about 1.3% total brokerage commission [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4929.0s)]
*  on buy side and sell side. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4933.0s)]
*  In China, 2.5%. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4934.52s)]
*  In Russia, 3.5%. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4935.88s)]
*  Some countries like Japan and Argentina [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4937.4400000000005s)]
*  are comparable to the US at 6%. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4939.4800000000005s)]
*  France is at 5%. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4941.8s)]
*  Germany's at 4.5%. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4943.080000000001s)]
*  Can I ask a question for you, Bert? [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4944.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4945.88s)]
*  I only own one house. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4946.400000000001s)]
*  So I've never gone through this experience, really, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4947.400000000001s)]
*  that I can remember because that was more than a decade ago. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4949.92s)]
*  But today, if I wanted to sell a home, OK, I could sell it [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4952.280000000001s)]
*  to you, right? [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4957.96s)]
*  But if you have a broker, do I have to pay you 3% as well? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4959.080000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4963.52s)]
*  You could sell your home to me. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4964.0s)]
*  And then if I have signed, who pays your brokers 3%? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4965.52s)]
*  The seller pays the buyer's broker. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4969.16s)]
*  But they don't have to. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4971.92s)]
*  Yeah, no, here, it's really important to understand this. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4973.52s)]
*  If you're going to go buy a home, [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4975.8s)]
*  you're typically not signing a contract with an agent [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4978.16s)]
*  when you go home hunting. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4982.2s)]
*  The seller has an agent. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4983.68s)]
*  And in the agent listing, they say, hey, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4985.92s)]
*  if you're a buyer's agent and you show up, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4988.88s)]
*  we'll give you 3% commission. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4990.68s)]
*  And so the buyer's agents who don't actually [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4992.8s)]
*  have a contract with the buyer are like, well, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4995.12s)]
*  let me show you around homes. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4997.56s)]
*  Let me show you around homes. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4998.68s)]
*  And then they get to a home. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=4999.52s)]
*  And they're like, OK, this home's listed. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5001.04s)]
*  Let's buy it. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5002.88s)]
*  And they're going to make a 3% commission, which, by the way, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5003.64s)]
*  I just want to point out the disincentive there. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5006.22s)]
*  They're not looking out for my best interests as a buyer. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5008.360000000001s)]
*  They're looking out for their commission. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5011.0s)]
*  And the higher the price they get you to pay, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5012.6s)]
*  the more they make. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5014.4800000000005s)]
*  The more money they make. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5015.0s)]
*  What I want to understand, though, [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5015.96s)]
*  is if I'm going to sell my house to you guys [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5016.8s)]
*  and you guys have a buyer's agent, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5018.38s)]
*  can I just refuse to pay the 3%? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5020.76s)]
*  No one gets paid because the buyer's agent [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5022.56s)]
*  has no contract with anyone. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5024.92s)]
*  Yeah, you can just refuse. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5026.080000000001s)]
*  And you don't have a contract with anyone. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5027.280000000001s)]
*  The place where you end up paying a commission as a seller [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5028.64s)]
*  is if you sign a seller agent listing. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5031.4400000000005s)]
*  And where you sign a contract that sells to the seller's [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5034.160000000001s)]
*  agent, I'll pay you 3%. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5036.200000000001s)]
*  And I'm also going to pay a buyer 3% [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5038.080000000001s)]
*  if they show up with an agent. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5039.8s)]
*  And how do I list my house on MLS without a seller's agent? [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5040.6s)]
*  You cannot. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5043.4400000000005s)]
*  In California, I mentioned I recently went through this. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5044.160000000001s)]
*  I paid $99. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5046.6s)]
*  I did it all myself. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5047.84s)]
*  And I listed it on MLS without an agent. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5049.400000000001s)]
*  I've done a bunch of person-to-person sales [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5051.16s)]
*  of real estate where I haven't had any agents involved, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5053.36s)]
*  but I knew the people on both sides, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5055.96s)]
*  and we just did a transaction. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5057.42s)]
*  What was your legal cost per transaction on your side? [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5058.68s)]
*  Like $15,000 to do that? [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5061.92s)]
*  That was my exact number. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5063.8s)]
*  It was $15,000. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5064.92s)]
*  So just to give you a comparison here, Chamath, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5066.4s)]
*  if you were to have a million dollar house, that would be 6%. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5068.62s)]
*  It'd be $60,000. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5072.48s)]
*  So that's $15,000 in legal costs for you to sell it [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5074.92s)]
*  if I wanted to sell it to you directly. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5077.32s)]
*  And that's what happened. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5078.92s)]
*  So we sold it to you. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5079.92s)]
*  And we did it off the market, and now all the brokers [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5081.84s)]
*  in my neighborhood hate me. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5084.02s)]
*  They are really upset about it. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5085.32s)]
*  Imagine it was a $5 million house, or a $10 million, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5087.96s)]
*  or a $20 million house. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5090.34s)]
*  Is it true for commercial real estate as well? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5091.52s)]
*  Is this how it works? [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5093.8s)]
*  I don't know commercial. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5094.84s)]
*  Commercial real estate is the same situation. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5095.72s)]
*  So there's an agent that represents the building, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5097.72s)]
*  the landlord. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5100.16s)]
*  And Saxon talked about this. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5100.72s)]
*  Then the buy-side agent. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5102.04s)]
*  So what is Buffett? [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5104.4400000000005s)]
*  Buffett owns Berkshire Realty. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5105.7s)]
*  What is that? [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5107.24s)]
*  That's just basically it's a residency. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5107.84s)]
*  Residential broker, just like Coldwell Banker, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5109.84s)]
*  just like all these other brokers. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5112.4800000000005s)]
*  So sweeping up this 6% VIG. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5114.32s)]
*  Yep. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5115.88s)]
*  They were part of the lawsuit. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5116.38s)]
*  They were named, yeah. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5118.2s)]
*  They were named. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5119.4800000000005s)]
*  And if you listen to Buffett's earnings reports, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5120.12s)]
*  he often talks about how many sides of a transaction [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5122.360000000001s)]
*  they were on. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5125.28s)]
*  And that's kind of the key measure of revenue [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5126.32s)]
*  in that piece of the business. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5129.6s)]
*  And he was super ecstatic, I think, in 2020 or 21 [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5131.92s)]
*  when real estate boomed. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5134.56s)]
*  And he's like, we got this many sides of the business. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5135.76s)]
*  It's a great business. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5137.8s)]
*  It's cash generative. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5138.8s)]
*  Such a great business. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5139.64s)]
*  But that's the business. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5140.84s)]
*  You want to get as many sides as you can. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5141.8s)]
*  You want to get on a sell-side and buy-side in the market. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5144.24s)]
*  And you just get 3%, depending on which side you're on. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5147.16s)]
*  But now the court's basically said, hey, this is illegal. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5149.360000000001s)]
*  Here's how you'll know that the monopoly has ended, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5152.12s)]
*  is when the buy-side commission goes away. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5155.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5157.84s)]
*  I mean, the sell-side 3% may be excessive. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5158.6s)]
*  But I do think that the sell-side brokers do work [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5161.320000000001s)]
*  in terms of having to market the property. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5164.360000000001s)]
*  Whereas on the buy-side, the vast majority of the value [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5166.88s)]
*  is created by MLS, like you're saying, Freeberg. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5169.400000000001s)]
*  I think it's flipped, but in terms of where the value is. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5171.64s)]
*  But anyway, go ahead. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5174.24s)]
*  No, you have to stage the house, take pictures. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5175.08s)]
*  Yeah, as a buyer, I just want someone to look out for me [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5177.88s)]
*  and make sure I'm not, like, all the diligence [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5179.8s)]
*  that goes into researching a home [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5181.6s)]
*  and reading all the disclosures and going through them. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5183.04s)]
*  I don't know if you guys have gone through this. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5185.24s)]
*  It's hundreds of pages. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5186.32s)]
*  Yeah, I have gone through it. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5187.16s)]
*  But I'm a lawyer for that stuff, who I pay by the hour. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5187.9800000000005s)]
*  Right. That's what I do. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5191.8s)]
*  I'm not saying that the buy-side broker does nothing. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5192.64s)]
*  But I'm saying that most of what they do [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5195.16s)]
*  is to schedule appointments for tours for you [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5198.36s)]
*  after you've gone through MLS yourself [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5201.5199999999995s)]
*  and picked out what you want to see. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5203.44s)]
*  You give them the list, and then they just [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5204.5599999999995s)]
*  put it on your calendar. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5206.32s)]
*  You know what I would analogize it to is travel agents. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5207.16s)]
*  I don't know if you remember, like, I mean, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5210.32s)]
*  most people watch this show probably don't remember, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5212.2s)]
*  but in order to book an airline ticket a long time ago [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5213.639999999999s)]
*  before the internet, you call up a travel agent. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5216.72s)]
*  Because they have proprietary access. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5219.5599999999995s)]
*  They print it out and bring it to your house. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5220.4s)]
*  They have proprietary access to Sabre, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5221.96s)]
*  which is the online ticketing system. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5223.5199999999995s)]
*  Totally. Totally. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5225.68s)]
*  But then what happened is with the internet, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5226.52s)]
*  you had sites like Expedia just give you direct access [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5227.76s)]
*  to Sabre, and so you could book the ticket yourself. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5230.4s)]
*  There's no reason to have a travel agent. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5232.4400000000005s)]
*  Same thing has happened with MLS. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5233.96s)]
*  It used to be proprietary access by the brokers to MLS. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5235.52s)]
*  You couldn't even see it. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5240.36s)]
*  Then you had sites like Zillow [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5241.76s)]
*  basically give you direct access to MLS. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5244.28s)]
*  So you can just go on there and find what you're looking for. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5246.96s)]
*  And again, the main thing that the buy-side brokers do [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5249.8s)]
*  is to schedule the appointments. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5252.24s)]
*  Because you can't get a tour typically [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5254.08s)]
*  unless you're represented. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5256.28s)]
*  And if you're not represented and you reach out, [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5258.04s)]
*  then the seller's agent will try to basically enlist you. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5259.76s)]
*  Have you done a direct transaction, Sachs? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5262.68s)]
*  I'm curious. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5264.36s)]
*  You can. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5265.76s)]
*  I don't think you can residentially. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5266.6s)]
*  I mean, it's very, very hard. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5267.88s)]
*  Oh no, I've done it. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5268.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5269.56s)]
*  I mean, if you happen to already [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5270.4s)]
*  have pre-identified the buyer, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5272.44s)]
*  then yeah, I guess you could do it. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5273.96s)]
*  But basically what happened in our case, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5275.6s)]
*  Freiburg, I'm curious how yours went down. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5277.5199999999995s)]
*  I had told the person, or my wife had told the person, [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5279.56s)]
*  we love your home. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5281.96s)]
*  If you ever sell it, let us know. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5282.8s)]
*  And then we bought it with them off market. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5284.88s)]
*  And they said, we don't want to use brokers. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5286.92s)]
*  We don't want to pay this huge commission, [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5288.24s)]
*  which would have been hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5290.0s)]
*  And would you agree to this price? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5291.56s)]
*  And we're like, yes. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5293.92s)]
*  And then done. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5296.28s)]
*  How did yours come about, Freiburg? [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5297.12s)]
*  How did you find a buyer if you were on the sell side? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5298.2s)]
*  This is all like relationship driven people [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5301.32s)]
*  that I know and that kind of stuff. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5304.16s)]
*  So it's like, hey, yeah, so and so. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5305.56s)]
*  I think this is the future. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5306.4s)]
*  If two of the four people here have done it, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5307.44s)]
*  I think this is the future. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5308.96s)]
*  I don't know if that's the common model. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5310.44s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5312.68s)]
*  You need a marketplace. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5314.240000000001s)]
*  You need a marketplace. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5315.080000000001s)]
*  You need a marketplace. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5315.92s)]
*  And the brokers control the marketplace. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5316.76s)]
*  It's a one-off. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5318.280000000001s)]
*  It's a fluke when you actually happen to know your buyer. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5319.120000000001s)]
*  The MLS is the de facto market. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5321.92s)]
*  Because I mean, ask anyone in the country [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5323.92s)]
*  who's bought a home in the last year, five years, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5325.4400000000005s)]
*  almost everyone I'm sure went on Zillow or Redfin [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5328.68s)]
*  or Trillium and looked at homes. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5332.320000000001s)]
*  And the place that those marketplaces get their data [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5334.04s)]
*  is from MLS. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5337.96s)]
*  They sweep the MLS. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5338.88s)]
*  So the real kind of monopolistic breaking [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5340.6s)]
*  is can you break that marketplace? [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5344.64s)]
*  Can you break MLS? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5346.04s)]
*  And can you get some other alternative listing services [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5347.64s)]
*  going that enable this brokerage commission [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5350.320000000001s)]
*  to get competed away? [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5356.6s)]
*  Because it's currently locked up [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5357.4400000000005s)]
*  in the monopoly they have on the MLS. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5358.92s)]
*  What's so perverse, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5360.72s)]
*  here's where the monopoly comes from, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5361.6s)]
*  is that if the buyer had to pay the 3% directly [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5363.080000000001s)]
*  to the buyer's agent, [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5367.0s)]
*  and that was a choice you could make, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5368.04s)]
*  nobody would pay that much. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5370.04s)]
*  Of course. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5371.76s)]
*  I'm not saying that the buyer's agent [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5372.84s)]
*  doesn't provide some value, [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5374.56s)]
*  but there's no way you pay 3%. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5376.28s)]
*  But the reason they get it is because the brokers tell you, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5377.8s)]
*  well, you're not paying that, the seller's paying that. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5380.48s)]
*  But of course you're indirectly paying that [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5382.84s)]
*  because the transaction fees are so much higher. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5384.48s)]
*  And when the seller goes to list their house, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5387.16s)]
*  if you tell your seller's agent, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5389.72s)]
*  hey, I don't wanna pay the buyer's agent 3%, [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5391.4s)]
*  make it half a percent, they won't do it. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5393.52s)]
*  They will always make it equal. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5396.4s)]
*  So this is the game. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5398.08s)]
*  And this is where the locking comes from, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5399.16s)]
*  is the buyer doesn't have a choice [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5400.88s)]
*  and the seller doesn't really have a choice either. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5402.36s)]
*  As we wrap here, just real quick, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5403.96s)]
*  pull up that link, Nick, and go to number five. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5405.32s)]
*  So that is the key issue. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5408.2s)]
*  I don't have a horse in this race. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5409.48s)]
*  I don't own Redfin stock or anything, [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5410.5199999999995s)]
*  but here's Redfin explaining exactly what you talked about. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5411.84s)]
*  It's FSBO, for sale by owner, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5415.0s)]
*  and there's now these third party sites [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5416.68s)]
*  and they kind of allude to it there. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5418.08s)]
*  But you know what those are? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5419.96s)]
*  Those FSBO sites are actual real estate agents [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5421.28s)]
*  that are registered in the state and are members of NAR. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5424.92s)]
*  And so they have a right to list on MLS. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5428.04s)]
*  So what they're doing is they've basically set up [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5430.52s)]
*  a super simple website, [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5432.44s)]
*  and then they're posting your listing on MLS for you. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5434.16s)]
*  For a flat fee. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5437.04s)]
*  For a flat fee, [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5438.28s)]
*  rather than getting a commission on the sale. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5439.28s)]
*  Awesome, yeah. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5441.2s)]
*  And that's kind of interesting, [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5442.4s)]
*  but for most people they're like, well, I don't know. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5444.48s)]
*  Now, I don't wanna disparage the value [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5447.04s)]
*  of folks that are in this industry. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5448.96s)]
*  There's obviously a lot of value [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5450.12s)]
*  for agents and brokers in this industry, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5451.72s)]
*  but the real point is that if the monopoly breaks [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5453.4s)]
*  on the marketplace, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5456.12s)]
*  then the business model will get competed away, [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5457.36s)]
*  and there will start to be a change here. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5459.44s)]
*  And I think that this lawsuit [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5461.08s)]
*  and the settlement ultimately leads to a shift [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5463.08s)]
*  in the industry that would certainly benefit consumers, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5466.44s)]
*  but could have a negative economic impact [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5469.28s)]
*  because of the number of people [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5471.8s)]
*  that depend on brokerage fees as their job. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5472.72s)]
*  The settlement is likely to be [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5475.0s)]
*  that when you hire a broker, [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5476.92s)]
*  they will give you a form and you'll pick [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5479.28s)]
*  what percentage you wanna pay. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5481.2s)]
*  I'll pay you 2% and I'll pay the buyer's agent 1.5. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5482.88s)]
*  I'll pay you 1.5, I'll pay the buyer's agent too. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5486.92s)]
*  Or they should be caps on it, right? [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5489.16s)]
*  Or you should have, because of the incentives, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5491.52s)]
*  it doesn't matter if I sell my home, [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5494.36s)]
*  if it's a $5 million home, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5495.92s)]
*  it may matter to me, 5 million, 5.5 or 6. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5498.08s)]
*  It doesn't matter to the broker, their commission, [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5500.56s)]
*  they just wanna sell it as quick as possible. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5502.28s)]
*  If it sells for 4.5, 5.5, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5503.92s)]
*  it's relatively the same commission. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5505.96s)]
*  So it really should be based upon a flat rate [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5507.56s)]
*  up to a number and then a percentage above that number [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5509.96s)]
*  to align interests. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5513.4s)]
*  Anyway, keep an eye on this one folks [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5514.8s)]
*  because it's gonna have a massive impact. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5516.28s)]
*  All right, Colorado Supreme Court has removed Trump [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5518.84s)]
*  from the state's presidential primary ballot. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5521.92s)]
*  This was decided in a split, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5525.0s)]
*  four to three decision by the court. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5526.72s)]
*  It's worth noting that all of the justices [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5528.32s)]
*  were appointed by democratic governance [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5530.24s)]
*  to democratic state. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5532.32s)]
*  The court based its decision on section three [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5533.32s)]
*  of the 14th amendment. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5535.52s)]
*  This bars anyone from joining Congress, the military, [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5537.56s)]
*  or any federal state offices [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5540.120000000001s)]
*  if they have previously taken an oath [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5542.400000000001s)]
*  to support the constitution, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5544.400000000001s)]
*  then engaged in insurrection against the US. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5546.4400000000005s)]
*  This is the first time in US history [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5550.72s)]
*  that the 14th amendment has been used [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5552.68s)]
*  to legally disqualify a presidential candidate. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5555.160000000001s)]
*  The 14th amendment was originally passed after the Civil War [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5557.52s)]
*  and was aimed at former Confederates. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5560.88s)]
*  I'll say a couple of things. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5563.4800000000005s)]
*  The first is that I thought that the Democrats [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5564.320000000001s)]
*  were going out of their way to give Trump the election [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5566.72s)]
*  with the documents case. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5569.240000000001s)]
*  But now I think that they've basically made his [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5571.4800000000005s)]
*  winning the Republican nomination a foregone conclusion [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5578.8s)]
*  and he is the overwhelming favorite [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5581.88s)]
*  to win the presidency after this. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5584.76s)]
*  And the reason is pretty simple, [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5586.84s)]
*  which is if you take Donald Trump out of this, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5588.400000000001s)]
*  the idea that you haven't been convicted [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5591.72s)]
*  of a crime, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5596.52s)]
*  but now a government agency or a government court [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5598.84s)]
*  in this case can deprive you of what really is [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5603.280000000001s)]
*  like a pretty momentous sign of liberty and freedom, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5606.72s)]
*  which is to run for president of the United States, [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5610.4400000000005s)]
*  to deprive an American citizen unconvicted of that crime, [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5612.2s)]
*  of that right, I think is really a bad step [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5617.96s)]
*  in the wrong direction. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5621.0s)]
*  And so there just needed to be a lot more prudence [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5623.0s)]
*  and thought about this. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5626.44s)]
*  And I think that it will do nothing [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5628.64s)]
*  except embolden the base. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5631.04s)]
*  It'll get Republicans out to vote. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5633.88s)]
*  I think it creates a deep wave of momentum [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5636.44s)]
*  in the direction of Donald Trump. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5642.24s)]
*  And so this to me was just an absolute complete [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5645.68s)]
*  head scratcher that makes no sense [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5648.4s)]
*  and I think will surely to get overturned [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5650.96s)]
*  in the Supreme Court. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5653.28s)]
*  Freberg, your thoughts. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5654.8s)]
*  Okay, for those of you not watching, [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5658.2s)]
*  Freberg put both hands up in the air, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5659.96s)]
*  gave a shrug like a shrug emoji. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5661.88s)]
*  So if you want to understand Freberg's position on Trump, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5664.52s)]
*  it is shrug emoji. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5666.92s)]
*  Coming around the horn sacks red meat. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5669.16s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the Colorado Supreme Court [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5671.44s)]
*  banning Trump from the ballot? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5676.72s)]
*  I agree with what Jemma said. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5678.56s)]
*  Democracy now means the right of the people to vote [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5679.56s)]
*  for candidates approved by liberal judges. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5682.4400000000005s)]
*  And yes, J. Cal, all of these judges [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5685.0s)]
*  were Democratic appointments. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5686.56s)]
*  I think this case makes clear that the point [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5688.240000000001s)]
*  of all of this lawfare against Trump [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5690.56s)]
*  is to keep him off the ballot. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5693.04s)]
*  Until now, they've been pretending it's [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5694.120000000001s)]
*  about something else. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5695.72s)]
*  And I think this decision rips the mask [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5697.56s)]
*  of all the legalistic bulls**t [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5699.400000000001s)]
*  that we've heard throughout 2023. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5701.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, Democrats don't really give a damn [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5704.4800000000005s)]
*  whether he paid off a porn star [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5707.16s)]
*  or kept classified documents [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5708.96s)]
*  or supposedly led a racketeering conspiracy. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5710.76s)]
*  They just don't want him standing for a vote [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5714.24s)]
*  that he might win. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5715.92s)]
*  And I feel like all of the time we spent on this pod [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5717.48s)]
*  earnestly debating the details and legalities [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5719.72s)]
*  of the documents case, it was a total sucker's game. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5723.0s)]
*  That's the narrative they want us engaging in. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5726.28s)]
*  It never had anything to do with documents. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5728.44s)]
*  They just want to keep them off the ballot. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5730.88s)]
*  And I think that by being so naked about this, [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5732.8s)]
*  by ripping the mask off what they're trying to do, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5737.2s)]
*  the Colorado Supreme Court has really done us all a favor. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5740.16s)]
*  I mean, the Supreme Court of the United States [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5743.400000000001s)]
*  is surely going to reject this decision. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5745.6s)]
*  But the lasting impact is going to be [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5748.16s)]
*  in revealing liberalism's true face. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5749.68s)]
*  They are the real authoritarians. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5752.12s)]
*  And while restricting the right of the people [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5753.88s)]
*  to vote for the candidate who is leading the polls [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5756.28s)]
*  right now, they proclaim that they're saving democracy. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5759.12s)]
*  They self-glorify and engage in this self-righteous rhetoric [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5763.08s)]
*  that they're saving democracy. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5767.52s)]
*  I mean, the rest of the country, any normal person, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5769.320000000001s)]
*  is looking at this and saying, these people have completely [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5771.72s)]
*  lost touch with reality, completely lost touch. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5774.64s)]
*  The other unfortunate outcome of this [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5778.280000000001s)]
*  is that there will be a wave where people will talk [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5779.9400000000005s)]
*  about the big steal as this. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5782.68s)]
*  And what people will say is that there [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5785.4800000000005s)]
*  was an attempt by the Democrats to really roadblock Trump's [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5788.04s)]
*  ability to be voted up and down by the American people. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5791.44s)]
*  And that's disenfranchising the ability for people to vote. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5794.799999999999s)]
*  And I think that that's really unfortunate. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5799.5599999999995s)]
*  And I wish that the Democrats would [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5801.599999999999s)]
*  have thought about that in their calculus [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5803.16s)]
*  before engaging in what is really a deeply partisan thing [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5804.86s)]
*  to do. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5808.48s)]
*  This will get overturned. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5811.599999999999s)]
*  But the damage will be long lasting, unfortunately. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5814.5599999999995s)]
*  That's a shame. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5819.08s)]
*  Totally. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5819.759999999999s)]
*  Matt Taibbi had a good line. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5821.04s)]
*  He said that only people who live [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5822.36s)]
*  in a bubble, within a bubble, within a bubble, [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5824.719999999999s)]
*  could ever think a decision like this is a good idea. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5827.16s)]
*  Here are the three bubbles. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5830.92s)]
*  Number one, all of these judges were Democratic appointments. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5831.96s)]
*  So living within the Democratic Party is the first bubble. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5835.44s)]
*  The second bubble was the fact that they all [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5838.16s)]
*  went to Ivy League schools. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5840.84s)]
*  This was actually a 4-3 decision. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5841.92s)]
*  The four justices who went to the Ivy Leagues [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5843.88s)]
*  all voted for it. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5845.84s)]
*  They thought this was a good idea. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5846.599999999999s)]
*  The three that went to Denver Law School, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5848.099999999999s)]
*  the non-Ivy League school, were all against it [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5850.2s)]
*  and wrote scathing dissents against it. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5852.639999999999s)]
*  So that tells you the second bubble is the Ivy League. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5856.04s)]
*  The third bubble is people who've [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5858.08s)]
*  been totally marinating in the mainstream media [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5859.46s)]
*  and their coverage of this, because they [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5862.04s)]
*  think that they can just conclude that Trump [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5863.76s)]
*  is guilty of an insurrection, because it's just a fact, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5866.679999999999s)]
*  according to the media, they listen to. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5869.84s)]
*  Trump has never been convicted of that crime. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5871.48s)]
*  He's never even been charged with it. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5874.24s)]
*  Right, so I think that's an important distinction [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5875.96s)]
*  The 14th Amendment, which my understanding came about [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5878.96s)]
*  to keep members of the Confederate army out of Congress [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5882.64s)]
*  because they had rebelled against the government. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5887.96s)]
*  And so the whole point was this amendment was passed [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5891.36s)]
*  to keep anyone who'd engaged in insurrection or rebellion [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5893.48s)]
*  or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5899.6s)]
*  It may not be elected a member of the Senate, Congress, [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5901.92s)]
*  or president or vice president. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5904.3s)]
*  So Sax, if that's the case, that is still the 14th Amendment. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5905.64s)]
*  That's the claim being made here. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5909.280000000001s)]
*  It doesn't define whether or not there [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5911.160000000001s)]
*  needs to have been a conviction of a charge of insurrection. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5913.6s)]
*  Is that what will ultimately be the Supreme Court decision, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5917.84s)]
*  do you think? [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5922.0s)]
*  Is that he was or wasn't actually [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5922.52s)]
*  found in a court of law to have been guilty of insurrection? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5924.76s)]
*  No, it's that the actual Article III of the 14th Amendment [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5928.72s)]
*  doesn't even define the presidency as applying [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5933.96s)]
*  in terms of where this applies. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5938.16s)]
*  So even before you get to that legal threshold of the fact [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5939.7s)]
*  that he's never been tried for this thing, [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5942.4s)]
*  there is a simpler threshold, which is most legal scholars [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5944.32s)]
*  say it doesn't even point to the fact [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5947.96s)]
*  that you can actually hold the president to that standard. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5949.46s)]
*  So there's like all these layers in which. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5952.04s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5954.4800000000005s)]
*  It says no person shall be. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5955.12s)]
*  Well, it's unclear if officers of the United States [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5957.24s)]
*  includes the presidency. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5960.32s)]
*  I think that's one way you could overturn this. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5961.24s)]
*  Another way is to point out that there was no due process. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5963.36s)]
*  The dissents really harped on this issue of due process. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5966.48s)]
*  You had a district court decide after a five-day hearing [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5969.88s)]
*  in which Trump was not allowed to subpoena, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5974.4s)]
*  no subpoena power, no calling of witnesses, [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5977.9s)]
*  no cross-examination. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5980.099999999999s)]
*  They basically just looked at tape of the January 6 hearing, [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5981.48s)]
*  which was itself biased because Republicans didn't even [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5984.12s)]
*  get a chance to cross-examine. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5986.2s)]
*  So basically, they just looked at MSNBC coverage. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5988.24s)]
*  And this district court concluded on that basis [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5991.12s)]
*  that Trump was guilty of an insurrection. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5993.12s)]
*  Again, that is a crime for which he's never been convicted. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5994.88s)]
*  And he's never even been charged with. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5997.44s)]
*  And he's never even had the chance [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=5999.12s)]
*  to answer those charges in court. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6000.24s)]
*  And there was a special counsel at the federal level [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6001.8s)]
*  that declined to prosecute. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6004.16s)]
*  That's right. [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6005.84s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6006.36s)]
*  So, Sack, if a prosecutor had taken up the case [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6007.72s)]
*  and he had been convicted, would you [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6009.96s)]
*  support him being disqualified from the state ballots [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6012.36s)]
*  for being the nominee for a party for president? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6015.48s)]
*  Well, there was a very simple way [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6018.32s)]
*  to disqualify Trump from running again, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6020.04s)]
*  which was to impeach him, was to convict him [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6022.12s)]
*  in the impeachment trial. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6023.88s)]
*  Remember, the second impeachment was all about January 6. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6024.88s)]
*  And he was basically. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6028.28s)]
*  I'm talking about the courts. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6029.48s)]
*  He was exonerated. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6030.32s)]
*  That was the time to do it. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6031.6s)]
*  Now, I don't know if a conviction for incitement [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6033.48s)]
*  to insurrection would hold up in that way, Freberg. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6038.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6040.76s)]
*  But the point is they didn't even try. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6041.28s)]
*  And the reason is because when Merrick Garland first came in, [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6043.44s)]
*  they actually did an analysis of January 6. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6046.04s)]
*  And there was a memo written. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6049.08s)]
*  And it said that if we, the DOJ, try [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6050.56s)]
*  to prosecute Trump for either incitement or for insurrection, [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6053.240000000001s)]
*  we will lose that case. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6056.6s)]
*  And so Merrick Garland didn't bring those charges. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6058.0s)]
*  Then there was a story in The New York Times saying [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6060.080000000001s)]
*  that Biden reacted really negatively to that. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6062.080000000001s)]
*  And he told his inner circle that Garland needed [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6064.56s)]
*  to stop acting like a ponderous judge. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6067.200000000001s)]
*  This is The New York Times words. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6070.04s)]
*  And that he needed to take decisive action. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6071.92s)]
*  And Biden made clear to his inner circle, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6075.200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to provide the receipt on this, [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6077.080000000001s)]
*  that he thought Trump should be prosecuted. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6078.92s)]
*  So all of this lawfare ultimately flows from that. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6081.12s)]
*  It flows from the top. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6084.0s)]
*  Biden is the most vindictive president we've ever had. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6085.32s)]
*  I cannot think of another time in American history [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6088.04s)]
*  where a president incited his own aides and advisors [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6091.12s)]
*  to basically go prosecute the leading [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6095.8s)]
*  alternative for the presidency that he's [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6098.32s)]
*  likely to face in four years. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6100.76s)]
*  That is what happened. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6103.04s)]
*  By the way, we've seen this behavior before. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6104.08s)]
*  Remember, this is also the president [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6105.68s)]
*  who said we need to go look at this guy, meaning Elon. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6107.24s)]
*  I mean, I can't believe that this behavior is just [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6111.2s)]
*  accepted by so many Americans. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6113.44s)]
*  This is petty, vindictive, un-American behavior. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6115.96s)]
*  And it's anti-democratic. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6119.0s)]
*  And the people who are engaging in it the most, again, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6120.5599999999995s)]
*  are glorifying themselves as somehow standing up [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6123.2s)]
*  for democracy. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6126.12s)]
*  This is a joke. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6127.36s)]
*  And I think the average American is going to rebel against this. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6128.12s)]
*  And I said, I think it was like last year, [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6130.78s)]
*  that all of this lawfare, all these tactics and shenanigans [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6132.92s)]
*  that the Democrats were trying, is either [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6136.04s)]
*  going to put Trump in the big house or the White House. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6138.04s)]
*  And I think he's headed for the White House on this basis [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6140.48s)]
*  right now. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6142.36s)]
*  I agree. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6143.24s)]
*  You would say that it's reasonable [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6144.12s)]
*  that if he got convicted in a court of law [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6145.76s)]
*  for a charge of insurrection that he should not [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6147.48s)]
*  be allowed on the ballot? [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6150.4s)]
*  If the Supreme Court then decided [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6151.48s)]
*  that that's what the 14th Amendment meant, sure. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6152.94s)]
*  But that's not what happened here. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6155.84s)]
*  There's zero due process. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6157.88s)]
*  I get it. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6159.12s)]
*  I'm just trying to understand where your threshold is. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6159.62s)]
*  So you think this will certainly go to the Supreme Court [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6161.76s)]
*  and they'll adjudicate what the 14th Amendment really needs. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6164.3s)]
*  Because it's never been tried, the 14th Amendment. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6167.34s)]
*  Well, again, it was written. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6169.42s)]
*  Think about why that statute came about. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6170.7s)]
*  Chamath is right. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6172.7s)]
*  It was written for the Confederacy. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6173.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6175.1s)]
*  The only other time it was used was [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6175.66s)]
*  in 1919 against one person that was about to enter Congress [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6177.62s)]
*  who had given comfort to the Germans in World War I. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6181.5s)]
*  That's the only time we've actually invoked Article III, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6184.62s)]
*  Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6187.5s)]
*  Were they allowed to run? [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6189.06s)]
*  No. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6190.18s)]
*  They were not allowed to take the seat. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6191.02s)]
*  Now that's at the federal level and at the state level [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6193.54s)]
*  it's been used a couple of times. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6196.46s)]
*  The point of this is for me, again, take Trump out of it. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6198.1s)]
*  You do not, I think, I'm pretty sure, [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6203.62s)]
*  we do not want to find ourselves in a country where you can all [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6205.78s)]
*  of a sudden be deprived your liberty and your rights [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6212.74s)]
*  for random acts where somebody believes [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6217.18s)]
*  that you are a threat to them and that person is [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6221.54s)]
*  in a position of power to affect your liberty. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6224.38s)]
*  That can't happen. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6227.38s)]
*  Vote the man up or down. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6230.62s)]
*  Yeah, and I agree with that. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6231.86s)]
*  And I would say that, I mean, what you're speaking to [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6232.98s)]
*  is due process. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6235.14s)]
*  These judges basically believe that because the mainstream [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6236.98s)]
*  media says something is the case that we don't need [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6240.26s)]
*  to go through a legitimate court procedure to determine [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6243.34s)]
*  that as a legal finding. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6246.06s)]
*  They just declare that, OK, he's guilty of insurrection. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6248.42s)]
*  That was never proven. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6251.22s)]
*  People don't realize this thing can go the opposite direction [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6252.14s)]
*  so quickly. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6256.06s)]
*  Imagine that there's a Democratic candidate that [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6256.7s)]
*  is running against a Republican incumbent. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6259.38s)]
*  Is this the standard we want to create [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6262.1s)]
*  where there's this political warfare that happens, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6264.5s)]
*  where each party is trying to essentially prevent [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6267.3s)]
*  the leading candidate of the other party [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6271.860000000001s)]
*  from running in every election from here on out? [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6273.860000000001s)]
*  Because that's the precedent that is being created. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6276.54s)]
*  That's why I have such an allergic reaction to this. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6279.74s)]
*  That's totally true. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6283.34s)]
*  Why wouldn't every president from here try to do this? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6284.46s)]
*  I mean, it's already the case that every president that [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6287.98s)]
*  loses Congress is probably going to face an impeachment hearing. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6290.9s)]
*  That's happening too. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6295.54s)]
*  And now we're going to have a situation [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6296.42s)]
*  where every presidential candidate can [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6298.34s)]
*  be potentially excluded from the ballot based [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6300.38s)]
*  on a local court's findings. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6303.3s)]
*  From the Democrats' point of view, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6306.139999999999s)]
*  this was deeply short sighted. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6307.54s)]
*  And I think it has a very high chance [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6309.0199999999995s)]
*  of blowing up in their face. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6311.0199999999995s)]
*  We haven't heard from J-Cal. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6312.259999999999s)]
*  I get my information from two really good sources. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6313.299999999999s)]
*  The first one I recommend for our listeners is Cafe.com. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6316.219999999999s)]
*  It's a podcast by Preet Bharara. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6319.0199999999995s)]
*  Fantastic. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6321.379999999999s)]
*  He does really deep dives on these cases against Trump. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6322.099999999999s)]
*  Cafe.com? [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6324.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Cafe.com is his podcast. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6325.74s)]
*  Cafe.com. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6327.139999999999s)]
*  It's a paid podcast, but it's really detailed. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6327.94s)]
*  And then there's actually, speaking of lawfare, [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6329.9s)]
*  there's a lawfare podcast. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6331.86s)]
*  And so I listen to those. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6332.9s)]
*  And they're covering this and also the two other cases that [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6334.0199999999995s)]
*  are of note, the federal election interference [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6338.22s)]
*  case and the Georgia case. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6340.22s)]
*  Highly recommend that our listeners go to those experts [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6341.780000000001s)]
*  and get a really well-balanced view of the cases [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6344.62s)]
*  against the 45th president. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6347.62s)]
*  All right, for chairman, Jamath Palihappitee, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6349.5s)]
*  the new chairman of the all-run LLC. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6352.34s)]
*  I like chairman, dictator. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6354.22s)]
*  I don't want to lose to him. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6355.42s)]
*  Chairman, dictator, authoritarian. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6356.46s)]
*  No, no, J-Cal. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6359.18s)]
*  BIPOC. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OzpWVlt5Ok&t=6360.06s)]
