*  You want to run a marathon at 57 years old? 52. 51 to 52. I'll be honest, I miss you. Can you come [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=0.0s)]

*  definition be as much fun if I'm not there. It plays at bigger states and it's more challenging, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=13.6s)]
*  but it's not as much fun. There's not as much laughing. What's on the menu tonight for austerity [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  2023? The Amu's Bush is a Madeline with like a terrain of foie gras. Fantastic. In honor of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=22.72s)]

*  what? I like the idea we're doing some poultry. Chef Sean is firing on all cylinders these days. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=40.64s)]
*  He feels very like engaged. He was very engaged. Yeah, he's he's kind of going for it. He's been [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=45.2s)]
*  on Yeah, that was quite nice the other day, Brad. Because it's austerity measures. We had this [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=51.2s)]
*  incredible dish, and we're eating it. And then he said, caviar is on the bottom. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=56.08s)]
*  So we just we don't put the caviar on top. They just put it on the bottom. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=63.28s)]
*  The markets down. That's chipmunk style austerity. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=68.32s)]
*  I'm not lying. Am I like Oh, my God. No, he did say guys, the caviar is on the bottom, not the top. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=74.16s)]
*  All right, sax is here, everybody. So that means we have a quorum. Hopefully, the Sultan of Science, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=86.08s)]
*  who is on Wall Street today, taking a company public. So congrats to our bestie Friedberg. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=102.64s)]
*  Ding ding. He couldn't make it. He's at a dinner. So with us, the fifth beetle, as it were, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  Brad Gerstner is here to talk all things macro. Welcome back to the pod. How's life been? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=114.72s)]
*  Good to be back a little doma regatta to Jason, as you eat your way through Japan. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=120.32s)]
*  Yes, I am on my culinary tour. I'll be back Sunday. But I am having the time of my life here. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=126.4s)]
*  Are you running AdWords on your food blog? That's what it's come back to. I'm back to the weblogs, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=133.04s)]
*  ink days. I'm just trying to make $2,600 a day. I noticed your tick tock got 22 likes. Yeah, you [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=137.84s)]
*  know, I'm trying to figure out tick tock. I'm gonna but you know, but right as they shut it down, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=144.08s)]
*  that's when I'll figure it out. Well, that rev sure buy you another Japanese pancake or no, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  those pancakes, man are next level pet the fluffy pancakes here. Everything actually with the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=152.56s)]
*  exchange rate coming to Japan is so affordable. It's nuts. And this is a crazy week because it's [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=158.0s)]
*  a Tokyo Marathon. But everything is so affordable. The people are amazing. It's the best country to [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  visit in the world. I think for me, it's Italy, Spain. I mean, Italy's right up there too. But [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=168.88s)]
*  I would say Japan is like it's definitely top two or three. What do you love about it? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=174.4s)]
*  Best food. You know, I went there I took the I took the kids like five years ago, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=178.56s)]
*  the older three at the time. But they were younger. And you know, there's there's a negative [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  birthrate in Japan. And so number one, when you have any kid, but frankly, multiple kids, the, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=188.72s)]
*  the Japanese embrace you with so much love, because they love seeing these big families. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=195.2s)]
*  Yeah, they're unbelievably kind. We went to Kyoto, did the professors walk saw the cherry blossom [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=199.67999999999998s)]
*  festival, basically ate our way through Japan. That was my that was my only vacation trip I did. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  I've done like 10 or 12 trips for work. Once we I went with Reid Hoffman, and Reid set up this [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  thing where we went through all these different parts of Tokyo and he did this incredible sushi [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=218.39999999999998s)]
*  place. You have to go with somebody who can dial it in. Yes. And have all the hookups. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=224.08s)]
*  Brad, you spend much time in Tokyo and Japan? I haven't I've been there only twice. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=228.96s)]
*  And that was when I was poor and I stayed in a really small room and ate really shitty food. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  Oh, all right. So you're saying in 20 in 2022 when you became poor again. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=239.52s)]
*  Hotel we have rooms. He's like, is there a hostel? Yeah. All right. And with us, of course, the next [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  department. What cabinet position you going for, Sachs? Which we which we start floating here. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=253.76s)]
*  Oh, my God. Here you are with the disinformation starting already. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  It's a compliment. Secretary of Staff is with us. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=263.2s)]
*  DeSantis had a pretty great article on the Wall Street Journal. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=266.56s)]
*  Oh, really? I missed out. What did it? When they revoked the special administrative status [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=269.36s)]
*  for Disney, he wrote an article, I think it was Wednesday, Tuesday or Wednesday in the in the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=274.32s)]
*  Wall Street. What was his premise that they was a corporate or a culture that woke is a [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=278.64s)]
*  is basically modern Marxism and we have to defeat it. This is his language, not mine at every turn. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=283.84s)]
*  And Disney needs to just be business people and not feed the vocal minorities inside of [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=291.12s)]
*  their company like every other company should they should be subject to shareholder concerns [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=298.48s)]
*  that apply to the majority of shareholders? Well, I think this is why I think DeSantis [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=303.36s)]
*  is doing well with the Republican base. And you know, if you see polling of the Republican [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=308.15999999999997s)]
*  primary is he understands that it's not good enough just to have this sort of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=312.8s)]
*  Reagan-esque totally hands off government approach because the radical left is advancing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  its agenda not just legislatively, but through corporations, through ESG, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=322.16s)]
*  really through taking over key private sector institutions. And so he's willing to use [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  government to push back on that agenda on behalf of parents or on behalf of, you know, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=332.96000000000004s)]
*  what he sees as the majority of the country. And so it's a very different approach than, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=339.36s)]
*  you know, the Republican Party would have been 30 or 40 years ago. This is why, you know, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=344.16s)]
*  in the parlance of the base, he understands what time it is. And what's required here is not again, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=348.24s)]
*  this totally laser fair approach, but rather a much more energetic, aggressive approach [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=354.8s)]
*  towards checking these bad ideas wherever they come from. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=361.12s)]
*  Yeah, he's not the only one. I don't know if you saw this week, Bill Maher went on a bit of a press [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=364.8s)]
*  tour and he was on with Jake Tapper. And he made a very interesting, I think, point about [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=369.04s)]
*  liberalism versus wokeism. And it was quite articulate, you know, he's a pretty good [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=375.68s)]
*  observer of culture. He said they're kind of casting out the liberals in the party for this [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=380.32s)]
*  wokeism and the intolerant nature of the woke movement versus the liberal movement specifically [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=384.56s)]
*  under the lens of trans rights. But let's put that aside for now. We got a full docket before [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=390.96s)]
*  we get into the culture wars and the presidential elections. Let's start with we'll go private [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=396.32s)]
*  markets to public markets. Because they obviously dovetail so nicely. Item one on the docket today, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=402.48s)]
*  there is just a massive AI FOMO frenzy going on. Economist published a piece this week about the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=409.44s)]
*  insane fundraising in the generative AI space. This is stuff like chat GPT stable diffusion, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=416.0s)]
*  you've heard these names. And there are now 500 generative AI startups, according to this report [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=423.04s)]
*  that tracks with what I'm seeing in the early stage and not counting the open AI 10 Billy from [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=428.64000000000004s)]
*  Microsoft investment donation rev share roundtrip, whatever that is. They have so far collectively [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=434.24s)]
*  raised more than $11 billion. The article included this chart, which you can see if you're on our [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=440.88s)]
*  YouTube channel, and just tons of folks working in audio image and text. So we're basically looking [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=446.48s)]
*  at the multimedia basically revolution of PCs in the 90s, occurring again, and complete platform [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=455.20000000000005s)]
*  platform shift. Doug Leone from Sequoia, one of the greatest investors in history of Silicon Valley [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=462.56s)]
*  had this to say and we will comment on the other side of this 50 second clip from Doug. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=468.96000000000004s)]
*  I actually think that AI is the next platform shift. In the same way that mobile was the one [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=474.4s)]
*  before internet was the one before. So I think AI is real. But I said earlier, we're going to [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=480.88s)]
*  overestimate it in a short term, we're going to invest in everything in the same way that in 1999, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=486.64s)]
*  we invested in everything. But then Google came out of that, or Facebook came out of that. So I [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=491.84s)]
*  think you have to have a good head on your shoulder, where you don't practice FOMO, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=498.48s)]
*  where you don't chase every company. AI is real. AI is the next platform. But how do we not invest [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=504.0s)]
*  in everything that walks? How do we make certain investments based on market maps, based on thought [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  processes that are more rational, and not do every investment just because every other venture firm [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=517.36s)]
*  is doing everything best. All right, Shamath, what do you think of this massive influx? I think it's [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=524.08s)]
*  important to think about what the incentives are. As Charlie Munger says, show me the incentive and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=528.4s)]
*  I'll show you the outcome. I posted it into our group chat credits we sent all their private [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=534.9599999999999s)]
*  banking customers an offer they are now offering 6.5% for a three month T bill. 6.5%. And if you go [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=539.92s)]
*  back to what we talked about before, when the risk free rate is somewhere north of five or five and [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  a half percent, and banks are willing to give you 6.5% in the short term, you have to generate more [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=559.52s)]
*  than three times that to make an investment make sense when you're investing in the long term. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=567.36s)]
*  So three month money is going to pay you six and a half or seven. If you're going to invest for 10, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=572.48s)]
*  15 years, which is what you need to do typically for a startup, you need to get 20 to 25%. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=576.96s)]
*  So there's going to be a lot of pressure for venture investors to put the money to work. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=585.44s)]
*  Because otherwise, their LPs, their limited partners, the people that give them the money [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=591.76s)]
*  will have this attitude that goes somewhere along the following lines. Okay, I've committed to you. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=597.0400000000001s)]
*  Why aren't you investing? Because otherwise, I can get paid six and a half percent on the front end, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=602.32s)]
*  and so this is becoming very problematic. What am I paying you for? What am I paying you 2% a year [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=607.36s)]
*  in management fee for? So I think what happens, unfortunately, is the opposite of what Doug says. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=612.24s)]
*  I think good investors will try to follow Doug's feedback and advice. And the ones that have a [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  track record of distributions of DPI can do more of it than not. But I think most people will be [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=625.44s)]
*  under pressure to deploy the capital. And so the 500 odd companies, Jason, you mentioned, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=632.16s)]
*  will get a lot of it, and it'll get torched, because most of them probably won't amount to [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=637.12s)]
*  much of anything in the short term, you will create way too much correlation. And you will have zero [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=641.28s)]
*  time diversity, which as we've learned, is a recipe for terrible returns. Time diversity being, hey, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=647.12s)]
*  you deployed all this web two capital web three capital, sorry, crypto, whatever, in this very [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=653.36s)]
*  short period of time, you overpaid, you need to spread. Let it on fire. Let it on fire. Brad, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=657.28s)]
*  when you hear Chamath talk about the 6.5%, and then you look at private markets, you invest across [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=662.0799999999999s)]
*  the lifecycle of companies. Obviously, you're in some private companies we all know very well, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=667.6s)]
*  famously Snowflake, I think your biggest win ever, correct me if I'm wrong, in terms of a private. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=671.76s)]
*  How do you look at this? When you're a steward of capital, public markets, private markets, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=677.76s)]
*  and then just YOLO, just put it into, you know, some chart T bills or, yeah, bonds or whatever. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=684.96s)]
*  I mean, first, let's just frame, right, the chart that you showed, I think you said, you know, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=691.84s)]
*  X open AI, I don't know, something like 10 or $11 billion has been invested into some 500 AI [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  companies. I mean, I happen to agree with Doug that this is a platform shift on the same magnitude [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=703.84s)]
*  as the internet or mobile itself. In fact, it may be bigger than both of those. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=708.48s)]
*  But, you know, when I look at 10 or $11 billion, you know, let's put it in context, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=715.0400000000001s)]
*  Metta is going to spend 20 billion in one year alone on ARVR. And this is on an entire platform. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=721.6s)]
*  So I don't know, I think whenever you have something as tectonic as mobile or internet, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=730.64s)]
*  it deserves a lot of investment. And yes, it's going to be messy. And yes, Chamath's right, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=737.36s)]
*  the cost of capital, frankly, is limiting the amount of money going into these businesses [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=742.56s)]
*  already. So we see a lot of dry powder sitting on the sideline that's chasing new ideas. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=748.0s)]
*  I think one way one way to frame it as well is like, think about in 2000. We all knew that the [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=755.1199999999999s)]
*  internet was going to be big. We may have been lucky enough to conclude that search was going to [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=760.9599999999999s)]
*  be big. But if you invest in in Yahoo or InfoSeek or AOL or Excite, like, you know, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=765.1199999999999s)]
*  you tore it all that money went to zero. Right. So now think about just these large language [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=772.32s)]
*  models, right, the foundation models, which are driving and enabling all of it. Open AI, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=778.32s)]
*  you've got open AI, you got an anthropic, you got cohere, you got character, you got stability, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=783.44s)]
*  you've got lambda. It is almost impossible to know with any certainty, much like it was with the [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=788.8000000000001s)]
*  search engines in 99 2000, who's going to emerge where the value capture is going to be, it may [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=795.44s)]
*  all end up with Microsoft and Google. I mean, this may end up looking like iOS and Android [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=801.2s)]
*  at the foundation model level. And so, you know, I think as investors, for example, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=805.44s)]
*  on the foundation model side, I think it's very difficult to choose just one, particularly when [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=810.72s)]
*  the largest one is frankly captive and a proxy to Microsoft and they're capping your upside return. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=816.1600000000001s)]
*  So like those are difficult investment decisions that doesn't detract from the fact that I think [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=822.5600000000001s)]
*  it is as big as Doug suggests. And I do think there are going to be applications and tooling [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=828.96s)]
*  layer to come out of this that's going to produce really big winners. I would say that we [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=834.48s)]
*  are spending an extraordinary amount of time in this space. We haven't made a lot of investments. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=839.2s)]
*  I think you have to study, you have to get deep. I mean, Chamath, certainly, and I have been [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=845.44s)]
*  investing in this space for at least a decade, maybe 15 years, but don't underestimate [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=849.84s)]
*  that the transformer model really did change the game here. And we're now producing impacts [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=855.6s)]
*  much larger. Saks, last week, you said Lab 3 and crypto didn't kind of stick with you. You didn't [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=863.76s)]
*  see the use cases. And you in the first inning here or first at bat, you rattled off three or [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=870.0s)]
*  four really compelling use cases from summaries to, you know, the the assistant guide on your side [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=878.4s)]
*  concept. Is this a kin in your mind? Because Brad just said it could be bigger than mobile, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=883.84s)]
*  internet, mobile, AI revolution. If you were to look at those three, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=890.0s)]
*  do you think it's bigger than actually mobile? And then we'll get into return profiles of 6.5% [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=894.88s)]
*  on cash versus what are VCs going to be able to do in this kind of market? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=900.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, so I agree with Brad and Doug that this is the next big platform shift, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=903.84s)]
*  whether it's as big as mobile, or it's more like social or cloud. I mean, those have been [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=908.4s)]
*  the big platform shifts over the last decade or two. And I think this is definitely on par [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=912.8s)]
*  with those. I think Brad's right, we don't know where the value capture is going to be. Maybe it [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=918.4799999999999s)]
*  just all ends up accreting to the big companies who can make massive investments in this space. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=922.4s)]
*  You know, one difference between the internet ecosystem today and 20 years ago is you do have [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=927.4399999999999s)]
*  these giant companies who are not totally incompetent, right? I mean, they are, they do [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=933.04s)]
*  have lots of talented engineers. And, you know, like 20 years ago, you'd have company, you know, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=937.4399999999999s)]
*  the big companies would just sit on their hands in the face of a platform shift. And they'd just [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=942.4s)]
*  be sitting ducks who get disrupted. That's not going to happen today. That being said, I do think [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=946.48s)]
*  that any new platform shifts creates opportunities for startups. And it may not be efficient the way [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=951.12s)]
*  that these options get pursued in the sense that yeah, Doug's right that this will be a lot of [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=958.16s)]
*  spray and pray. But I think that it is kind of efficient for the ecosystem as a whole, right? [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=963.12s)]
*  Because like any smart engineer with a half decent idea ends up getting funded. And out of all of [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=970.0s)]
*  that, you get kind of a pre-Cambrian explosion where, you know, the ecosystem evolves a lot [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=975.76s)]
*  of different types of businesses. Most of them don't work, they get wiped out, they go extinct. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=981.76s)]
*  But there'll be some good things that get funded. So we're more like, I think, Doug and how we see [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=985.92s)]
*  it, we don't want to spray and pray, we want to be very selective. We want to put more money behind [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=990.96s)]
*  fewer opportunities that we think are better. And Doug Leone, you know, I think he generally [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=995.84s)]
*  gives good advice of the tough love variety. And this is of a piece with that. And so I agree with [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1001.36s)]
*  him. That being said, there is a certain value to the ecosystem and having all these seed funds [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1006.64s)]
*  to spray and pray, right? Because this gets a lot of plants, a lot of flowers, and then you see [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1012.24s)]
*  what blooms. I would say, yeah, to build on that, Sacks, this is a perfect inefficiency. You know, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1016.4s)]
*  when you see it from the outside, you're like, well, this is super inefficient. Why so many [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1022.72s)]
*  companies, if you free your mind and just say there are experiments, two or three person [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1025.84s)]
*  experiments, 500k to a million and a half in that first stage when I invest right before you do [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1029.44s)]
*  when you do your series A is at five or 10 million. Milestone based funding is back in the tech [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1034.24s)]
*  industry. And that was something Chamath that we lost for a little while there, people would just [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1040.8s)]
*  come out and they would raise a series B out of the gate, no product market fit, etc. Now what [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1044.96s)]
*  we're seeing is people are raising that 12 to 18 months, they got their backs up against the wall. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1050.08s)]
*  Speaking of tough love, which you reference, Sacks, that tough love of, hey, you have to hit [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1055.12s)]
*  the next milestone, what did you accomplish with the 1.5 million in order to get the 10 million [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1060.1599999999999s)]
*  in order to get the 30 million, that 500 is going to go 10x, there'll be 5000 of these startups, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1065.12s)]
*  but it will quickly whittle down wouldn't your mouth as people go through this [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1070.56s)]
*  milestone based funding system in Silicon Valley. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1074.08s)]
*  We haven't given enough time for a logical framework of investing to develop, which also [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1077.76s)]
*  is tied to a logical framework for entrepreneurship to emerge. We're just way, way, way too early. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1082.4s)]
*  So the thing with all of these language models is that they are grist for the mill. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1089.2s)]
*  And we talked about this before, if it was a highly proprietary asset, you would have never sold 49% of [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1094.32s)]
*  it to Microsoft for $10 billion, because you would assume that it was worth a trillion dollars. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1102.4s)]
*  So it's a huge tell on the part of OpenAI, their deep understanding, and they understand it better [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1107.12s)]
*  than anybody else, that it's a bit of a capped upside. So what is uncapped, I guess, is maybe [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1113.1999999999998s)]
*  the better question. Well, if you look at the 1849 gold rush, as an example, the people panning for [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1118.9599999999998s)]
*  gold, in my opinion, are the people building language models today. They're going to come and [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1126.08s)]
*  they're going to go, but who's going to win? Well, the pick and shovel providers won, Levi Strauss [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1131.12s)]
*  won. So what is the equivalent of that today? I think it's at the silicon layer, because you need [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1136.4s)]
*  to really re-architect how compute will actually work in a world of all of these models. Those folks [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1142.3200000000002s)]
*  will get paid. If you look at AMD and Nvidia, they've been getting paid for years. They continue [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1147.68s)]
*  to get paid. They probably will continue to get paid even more. And so folks that actually [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1153.6000000000001s)]
*  take a step into doing something hard and difficult in AI, like custom silicon, could get [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1160.0800000000002s)]
*  rewarded. And then there's what I call the white truffles. What are these unique ALBA white truffles, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1165.04s)]
*  these singular sources of data that when used in reinforcement learning, make your output just zing. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1172.08s)]
*  And that's where I think Facebook is an obvious white truffle. Quora is a white truffle, but there [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1183.28s)]
*  are a lot of startups that could become white truffles if they gather enough data. And that's [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1190.32s)]
*  like a pretty reasonable framework. And so in that framework, if you apply it to today, there's [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1196.48s)]
*  way few silicon startups and there's way few white truffles. Instead, it's everything is the baloney [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1202.48s)]
*  in the middle, which is random people talking about some random model that's just going to, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1207.04s)]
*  again, become highly commoditized. You have to remember, all these models are open source, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1210.96s)]
*  and none of them mean anything in the absence of the data you give it to train on. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1214.6399999999999s)]
*  100%. Brad, hey, okay. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1219.2s)]
*  Well, I want to add one other piece of news that we saw this week, which is OpenAI announced that [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1222.0800000000002s)]
*  it's developer AI, they were cutting the tax on that, or basically the metered rate they charged [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1227.44s)]
*  to use it by 90%. So I think this is going to be a game changer. I think this is based on the [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1232.4s)]
*  Chad GPT 3.5 API. And of course, we're coming out with 4.0 later this year. I've already had... [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1240.4s)]
*  Explain to the audience what an API is and why this is important for those people who don't know. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1246.4s)]
*  This application programming interface, it allows a developer of some other application to build on [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1251.3600000000001s)]
*  top of you. So in other words, a developer wouldn't have to use this chat interface to [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1256.5600000000002s)]
*  get access to the large language model. You could just submit your request through the API. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1262.3200000000002s)]
*  And so... Give an example of a popular app and how they might use the chat GPT API. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1267.2800000000002s)]
*  So I think Notion actually had a demo that they published where... [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1273.76s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1276.8s)]
*  It was a pretty incredible demo. Maybe we can find it. And it would do things. They added actions [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1277.68s)]
*  in the demo, like generate a task list. So you could take a document or a meeting summary [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1283.44s)]
*  and would spit out recommendations for next steps or tasks. It could spit out a table. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1290.96s)]
*  Basically, it's the autocomplete for everything that we talked about. So now Notion doesn't need [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1297.12s)]
*  to build their own LLM expertise. They just use the API. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1301.36s)]
*  So when the Notion app, you say, hey, I'm building a marketing plan and you say, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1305.36s)]
*  well, okay, give me a list of things that should be on my marketing plan for my new app. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1310.1599999999999s)]
*  It sends a signal to the chat GPT API, which will be on Azure Microsoft's platform. And then it gives [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1314.32s)]
*  you the data back. You don't have to build the language model. Incredibly powerful. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1319.76s)]
*  Notion has all the content that they need, but they don't have the AI expertise. Now they don't [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1323.36s)]
*  have to generate or create AI expertise in-house. They just use the API. It's really powerful. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1328.16s)]
*  Just to finish the thought here, I think that one of the things that's probably misleading about [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1334.64s)]
*  these stats around funding and that there's almost 600 startups already, there are AI startups, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1338.88s)]
*  is that what happens when there's a new wave is that founders are smart, right? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1345.0400000000002s)]
*  And they know how to market themselves in the way that is most compelling to VCs. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1349.44s)]
*  And they know that VCs, frankly, are a little bit lemming-like in terms of their migration [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1354.4s)]
*  to the next wave and wanting to glom on to the next big wave. So VCs are now looking for AI. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1358.64s)]
*  If you're a founder and you build one feature on top of the OpenAI API, now all of a sudden, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1364.24s)]
*  you're going to market yourself as an AI company. You're not going to market yourself as just a SaaS [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1372.64s)]
*  company. And that's valid. Yeah. I mean, it could be gamed or it could be like a great pivot. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1376.88s)]
*  Yeah. And it's not totally one or the other. I mean, it's just that if you have a plausible [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1382.6399999999999s)]
*  connection to AI as a founder, you're going to start marketing yourself as an AI company. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1387.6799999999998s)]
*  And so that's how all of a sudden you can have 600 of these companies that are all of a sudden [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1392.32s)]
*  out there in the wake of this sort of chat GPT, is I think a lot of companies are recategorizing [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1399.6799999999998s)]
*  themselves. I literally had this experience not three weeks ago, right before I went to Japan, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1405.36s)]
*  serial founder and team that we've backed for that had an exit said, Can I show you something? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1410.4s)]
*  I said, Yep, got on the zoom showed me a little proof of concept using chat GPT. And he said, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1415.1200000000001s)]
*  This is my idea. This is the vertical. And I just said, Okay, what do you want? He said 500k for 10% [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1422.5600000000002s)]
*  I said, Okay, done. Great. Let's learn. And it's an easy bet for us to make because we know it's a [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1427.68s)]
*  serial team. For OpenAI, the way that it could become a trillion dollar company is actually by [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1432.5600000000002s)]
*  cutting the cost to such a low degree that nobody else can effectively compete with it. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1437.6s)]
*  And then at that point, they can become a small, small, small tax, you'd rather just pay it than [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1442.48s)]
*  try to compete with it. And I think for OpenAI, that's actually a very brilliant strategy. So [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1446.9599999999998s)]
*  that's how they, they could get to become very, very large in valuation would be to become so [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1451.12s)]
*  pervasively relied upon. And where they take such a minuscule take rate of their participation in [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1457.04s)]
*  you building a company that could be really effective for them. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1464.24s)]
*  Like cloud computing, right? Like we're going to just take such a small tax. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1466.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's not a small tax. That's a large tax. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1469.12s)]
*  That's the picks and shovels play in a way to create the developer ecosystem for [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1471.6799999999998s)]
*  AI and to your point, I mean, I think you raise a good point that, you know, what was their [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1475.84s)]
*  motivation to take such a dilutive round, you know, the 10 billion at what was evaluation at 30? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1480.32s)]
*  30. Yeah. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1486.08s)]
*  Yeah. And does that imply that they're not confident? I mean, the flip side of it could be [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1486.8s)]
*  maybe they know they want to compete on the basis of rapidly, you know, becoming the developer [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1490.48s)]
*  platform. And so they're going to subsidize that developer platform, you know, with negative gross [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1496.4s)]
*  margins for some period of time. And maybe that's why they need a lot of capital. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1501.68s)]
*  And they were in kind of a reflexive loop of just cost of getting better versus the amount of money [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1504.88s)]
*  they had to get better. And so maybe they were forced to do it. And then in that point, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1510.08s)]
*  how would you justify it? You would say, well, the other 50% is still hugely valuable. So that's [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1514.8s)]
*  enough for us. And I think that that's that's very logical as well. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1518.72s)]
*  Brad, you have your finger on the pulse of LPs, limited partners who back funds like Chamath, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1522.0s)]
*  Sachs is mine and yours. We heard 6.5% on your money for no risk. Well, you and Chamath's [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1528.48s)]
*  position is hey, you have to triple that if you want to be a private market investor. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1536.64s)]
*  That's about 20%. 20% rule of 72. That means every three and a half years, you got to double. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1540.56s)]
*  If you're doing that for a 10 year fund, you're looking at a 5x fund is kind of table stakes, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1546.0800000000002s)]
*  then I think just back of the envelope math. What are LPs thinking right now? Are they looking at [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1551.76s)]
*  this world and saying I should just be all in cash? Or are they saying, yeah, everybody thinks we [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1556.4s)]
*  should be all be in cash. Therefore, there's not going to be enough money in private. Therefore, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1560.72s)]
*  there's an opportunity there. We know the 6.5% rate, you know, that's not going to be here forever, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1564.64s)]
*  it may be here for a little while. But we need to keep investing in venture. Or are they just [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1570.4s)]
*  cutthroat about it? Like let's pause venture investing, private market investing. It's a great [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1575.8400000000001s)]
*  question. First, when I look at the three year Treasury bill, it's like 4.7, not to quibble here. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1579.76s)]
*  So I think Chamath's getting a little goosey goosey on his 6.5. But the fact of the matter is- [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1584.72s)]
*  What does that mean? Goosey goosey? You're getting a little extra because you're super special. You're [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1591.44s)]
*  VIP JP. Oh, maybe there's like some sort of like a bond rate that included corporates or something. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1597.2s)]
*  Maybe it was. I'm getting like 5.2 from Robinhood on my Robinhood account for J Trading. So it's [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1603.76s)]
*  right. What is in that? What is in that Jason? They probably got some junk bonds and they're [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1608.4s)]
*  ripping you off. Whatever it is, I'm getting five points. It sounds pretty good to me. You are until [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1612.0s)]
*  you're not. You are until you're not. It's a hundred percent T bill, parentheses and junk bond funds. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1616.8s)]
*  Look at the fine print, J.K. LPs have a 10 year view. They understand, like most people, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1622.48s)]
*  listen, if you look out at the 10 year, the reason the 10 year is, you know, that we have real [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1632.24s)]
*  interest rates at about one and a half percent. So that's the 10 year less expected inflation. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1639.28s)]
*  When you look out is because people expect inflation to come down and they expect rates [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1646.64s)]
*  to come down. So if you were an LP and you said I'm not going to invest in venture in the next two [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1650.96s)]
*  vintages, which may be the best two vintages we've seen in a long time because prices are adjusting, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1655.04s)]
*  etc. And I'm going to move it all into some rate bet. First, it's just very difficult to do. They [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1660.64s)]
*  don't move their allocations around that quickly. Now, a wealthy family as an LP could move their [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1666.16s)]
*  allocations around really quickly. But if you're Texas or you're Ohio or you're a sovereign wealth [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1672.64s)]
*  fund, you're betting on the arc of value creation. I would say this, the consequence is they're [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1677.52s)]
*  narrowing their aperture as to the venture funds they want to allocate capital to. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1683.2s)]
*  Okay, explain that. Unpack who they are narrowing the aperture to. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1687.92s)]
*  We've talked a lot on this pod about the power law. And the truth of the matter is whether we're [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1691.76s)]
*  talking about AI or software or anything else that people are going to be funding, it's 10% of the [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1697.44s)]
*  investments that are going to yield 90% of the returns. And so they're looking at that and saying [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1705.36s)]
*  who are the top 10 firms in Silicon Valley, I either want to get allocation to those firms [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1712.3999999999999s)]
*  who are seeing the best deals, converting the best deals and are selective like Sachs talked about, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1716.8s)]
*  or we just don't want to allocate. So I think, you know, what we saw over the last two years, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1721.52s)]
*  Jason, was an explosion of new funds and explosion of new, you know, first time, second time funds. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1725.6799999999998s)]
*  I think subscale small funds with no DPI, they're going to find a really, really tough time [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1732.96s)]
*  to Chema's point about DPI raising capital, and you're going to see the scale player scale. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1741.28s)]
*  So part of that is clearing out the inventory from the last cycle. Two new stories this week [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1746.72s)]
*  about companies, you know, maybe struggling. Sequoia got off the board of Citizen. If you [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1753.1200000000001s)]
*  don't know Citizen, that's that app that tells you where crimes are happening in your city. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1759.36s)]
*  Very popular in San Francisco. It's literally goes off every 90 seconds. It's pretty dystopian. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1762.8s)]
*  That company Citizen, which is a pretty cool app, has raised 130 million to date. Sequoia led the [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1769.12s)]
*  series A in 2017. They did a pay to play around if you don't know what that is. Basically, if you [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1774.32s)]
*  don't invest, you get crammed down. How does the cram down work? Well, your shares in the company [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1780.9599999999998s)]
*  went down 10 to one. And you probably got moved to common shares as opposed to preferred, which [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1785.12s)]
*  has a series of protections, they get their money out first, yada yada. But Sequoia refused to [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1792.32s)]
*  participate according to this FT story. Again, Sequoia did not comment on this. It's it's kind [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1798.0s)]
*  of something you don't do as a VC when something goes bad at a company and you leave the board. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1804.8s)]
*  You generally don't want to say bad things or taint the company any more than leaving the board [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1810.08s)]
*  does. So a bunch of cram downs happening and then dovetailing with that Instacart, according to the [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1815.44s)]
*  Wall Street Journal had a big Q4 as it prepares to go public. Instacart, if you remember, we talked [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1821.6s)]
*  about it on the show cut its internal valuation 75% last year from 39 billion to 10 billion, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1827.92s)]
*  according to sources. Instacart's Q4 results, according to the Wall Street Journal, up more [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1835.6s)]
*  than 50%, even though order volume grew only 16%. Why they turn advertising on the app just like [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1842.0s)]
*  Uber and Amazon, a lot of these commerce folks are building ad business inside of theirs. So [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1847.84s)]
*  what do you think about what's happening as we clear out this private? Anybody have thoughts [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1855.76s)]
*  on Instacart or the cram down rounds? Go either way with this and then we'll go to public. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1861.36s)]
*  I wouldn't focus too much on those two companies. I think we're going to see in the second half of [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1865.6799999999998s)]
*  23 and all of 24 is a lot of medicine being taken, a lot of down rounds, a lot of structure. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1869.1999999999998s)]
*  It's going to be a tale of two cities. The hot area, AI is going to continue to receive new [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1875.76s)]
*  investment and all these companies that receive peak valuations in 2021 are going to have a day [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1880.7199999999998s)]
*  of reckoning. Either if they're lucky, maybe they have a flat round or modestly up round, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1888.72s)]
*  but a lot of them are going to have down rounds or restructurings. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1894.08s)]
*  This is going to be going on for the next year and a half. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1897.6000000000001s)]
*  What's your philosophy, Saxon, leaving a board? This is a really dicey issue. When you give up [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1899.76s)]
*  on a company, what's the best practice there? How do you do it without damaging the company? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1903.6000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, the founder relationship is going to be hard. What have you learned about this as a [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1908.64s)]
*  private market investor? Sometimes we flip board members internally at Kraft just because people [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1913.2s)]
*  have different amounts of capacity. That's not a statement at all about the way Kraft feels about [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1920.4s)]
*  the company. It's just a reflection of our individual bandwidths or whose expertise are needed [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1924.0s)]
*  at that time. When the firm itself quits a board, I think there's no way to read that other than [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1928.72s)]
*  a statement of protest. I don't know what happened at that company, but it seems to me [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1936.16s)]
*  that, again, it could be a sign that the venture firm isn't happy with the way that they're being [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1941.0400000000002s)]
*  treated. The cram down, Chamath, that's a bitter pill to swallow. Why would founders do this cram [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1947.92s)]
*  down instead of just adding a little more to the top? Is there a way to do this without [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1954.48s)]
*  going scorched earth or poisoning the well, as it were? Again, putting this app and Sequoia aside, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1961.8400000000001s)]
*  this is happening all over the ecosystem. Is there a way to do this gracefully or is it just [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1969.2s)]
*  going to be messy? I think it's going to be really messy. To state the obvious, no venture [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1973.36s)]
*  capital investor ever quits the board voluntarily of a great company that's doing well. That would [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1981.28s)]
*  be dumb. As David said, the proof is in the pudding there. At the same time, there are a lot of [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1986.96s)]
*  companies who don't want to see the writing on the wall and will do all kinds of gymnastics [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=1997.04s)]
*  to try to stick a landing on a contorted financing. Sometimes those things have [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2007.36s)]
*  real consequences to other investors who just don't think it's the right thing to do. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2014.08s)]
*  I wouldn't read too much into this except that good founders have a responsibility to do what's [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2018.08s)]
*  right for themselves and their employees, nobody else. The thing to keep in mind- [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2025.2s)]
*  Not the investors, really? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2030.4s)]
*  I think you absolutely have to prioritize the people doing the actual work. If you actually [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2032.48s)]
*  did prioritize them, what you would probably say to yourself is, oh my gosh, there are people who [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2038.24s)]
*  I work with, who I look in the eye every day. Because investors you'll see once a quarter. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2043.2s)]
*  But I have my fellow employees as a founder that I look in the eyes every day who've been toiling [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2047.44s)]
*  with me for umpteen hours a day, every day for years, and they are now totally underwater. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2052.96s)]
*  What is the right thing to do for them? I think if you just answer that question, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2062.08s)]
*  you wouldn't do all these contorted things. You would just reset the valuation. You would [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2066.64s)]
*  refresh the equity pool. You would issue options back out to those employees and you would move on. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2071.36s)]
*  It's all these other things that get in the way of answering that simple, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2078.7200000000003s)]
*  simple question where people fuck it up. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2082.24s)]
*  And I've done that before. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2085.3599999999997s)]
*  Sachs, if you don't have a team and you don't have a motivated team, you have nothing. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2086.9599999999996s)]
*  I've done that before. I don't want to rehash one of my more miserable experiences, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2090.64s)]
*  but I was dealing with a company that had a grossly inflated valuation. It was a total problem case. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2094.64s)]
*  We voluntarily slashed the valuation in half and reissued options to the employees [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2100.16s)]
*  to keep them motivated. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2104.16s)]
*  No big deal. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2105.6s)]
*  So yeah, yeah, exactly. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2106.08s)]
*  And it's not that it's no big deal, but it requires some amount of fortitude [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2107.52s)]
*  and understanding your priorities, I guess. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2112.08s)]
*  Well, Jabod, first, I think it's revealing that we think what happened here [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2116.6400000000003s)]
*  is so out of the ordinary. I mean, you flash back to 2001 to 2004. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2124.0s)]
*  Sequoia, I don't think, funded a single loser in their portfolio. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2129.2000000000003s)]
*  That's a time where you walked away from the ones that weren't winning [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2134.1600000000003s)]
*  and you fed the ones that were because you have limited capital and you don't know when you're [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2137.52s)]
*  going to raise your next capital. This idea that you have unlimited capital, you can give money to [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2142.72s)]
*  anybody no matter what they're doing with respect to their plan, I think is a function of the last [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2147.2s)]
*  10 years. But to Chimass' point, the idea of tough talk, either out of CEOs or out of board members [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2152.32s)]
*  has been in short supply in Silicon Valley. This idea that saying the truth, just speaking the [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2160.48s)]
*  words about needing to get fit or needing to lower the valuation, that somehow that is founder [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2166.72s)]
*  unfriendly is nonsensical. The truth is founder friendly by definition. And I think to Chimass' [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2172.08s)]
*  point, the less complicated you make this, you reset the valuation, you re-up the option pool, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2179.04s)]
*  and then everybody has a choice to make. And if the people who are on the board and backing the [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2186.0s)]
*  company choose not to re-up for whatever reason, they no longer believe in the path forward for [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2190.24s)]
*  the company that's incumbent upon the founder to go find people who will. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2195.12s)]
*  Aaron Powell That's not abandonment as it's being framed in this story. It is a trade. And I think [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2197.92s)]
*  maybe if you look at public market investors, Brad, nobody gets upset by a trade, trade's a trade. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2203.12s)]
*  But in the private markets, there's a lot more emotion involved, a lot more relationship [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2209.92s)]
*  material. And this founder friendly concept of like, you're abandoning me, it's like, no, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2214.08s)]
*  the trade here, it makes no sense for this firm and for this fund and for these LPs, right? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2219.2s)]
*  Brad Sparrow Sometimes, the founder needs to have the courage [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2224.32s)]
*  to look in the mirror and say, what I'm doing is not working. I had a plan, I missed the plan by 70%. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2228.88s)]
*  I'm lighting capital on fire. This is a charity, not a business. It's best to say it didn't work, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2235.36s)]
*  shut it down and move on and do something else. Aaron Powell Okay, so of course, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2240.96s)]
*  you're referencing Salesforce, so we'll pivot to that. I'm joking. It's not that bad. But I think [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2244.0s)]
*  this is a good time to maybe talk about the public markets and inflation and what we're seeing in [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2249.2s)]
*  macro. So can I set up a question for Brad, actually? Sure, go ahead. Yes. Yeah. So on a [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2254.7999999999997s)]
*  previous podcast, I laid out my theory of how you could just use the two year bond rate relative to [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2259.52s)]
*  the Fed funds rate to understand where the bond markets sort of prediction market about inflation [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2266.3999999999996s)]
*  is going. And a month ago, the two year bond rate was at 4.1% relative to 4.5% Fed funds rates. In [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2273.44s)]
*  other words, the bond market was betting that interest rates would go down between now and two [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2281.04s)]
*  years from now relative to where the Fed had it. So therefore, it believed that inflation had been [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2287.2000000000003s)]
*  conquered. Now, fast forward just one month later, and the two year bond rates at about 4.9%, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2292.88s)]
*  you know, the Fed funds rates about 4.5%. That is a massive swing, basically 80 basis point swing [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2300.2400000000002s)]
*  in the, I guess, two year bond rate. And so the markets seem to be saying all of a sudden, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2307.6800000000003s)]
*  not just that they expect rates to be higher longer, but also that the Fed needs to keep raising. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2314.4s)]
*  And that is a big change. So Brad, what is the basis for that? And what do we now believe about [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2320.4s)]
*  inflation? I think just a few weeks ago, we were thinking that this problem was licked and the [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2327.28s)]
*  market took off like a rocket, it ripped. Now, all of a sudden, it seems like investors are really [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2332.0800000000004s)]
*  worried that inflation is not over. So where does this stand right now? Well, I think when we started [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2337.28s)]
*  the year, you know, the 10 year was close to three to we're now we're closer to 4%. The 10 minus two [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2343.52s)]
*  is as negative as it's been in the last probably 10 years. So the market is clearly saying, you know, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2351.44s)]
*  we saw some inflation prints that came in hotter. I think it's now consensus, which you guys have [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2357.84s)]
*  been saying on the pod, that, you know, although the second derivative is slowing, that it's sticky, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2363.2000000000003s)]
*  right? We're going to get stuck at this four, four and a half, three and a half. And it's the slope [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2369.28s)]
*  of the curve downward is going to be slower. We've gone from thinking we're going to have two 25s to [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2374.88s)]
*  now thinking wow, three or four. You know, and so I think everybody is now bracing for more inflation. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2379.84s)]
*  But remember, when we started the year on January 1, the consensus wisdom was we were going to [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2386.6400000000003s)]
*  retest the S&P at 3200. We're going to have an earnings recession, and that inflation was going [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2391.44s)]
*  to continue to run hotter. The only surprise in my mind so far this year is how well the equity [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2396.6400000000003s)]
*  markets have held up in the face of a 10 year that's gone parabolic, right? And an actual earnings [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2402.6400000000003s)]
*  recession. Right. And you know, you posted, you know, in our thread, Shamath, about just quality [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2408.64s)]
*  of earnings. You know, even the earnings beats are pretty low quality. And so I think, you know, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2413.8399999999997s)]
*  we now are going to have a couple inflation prints coming up over the course of the next couple weeks [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2419.92s)]
*  that are going to be important. My hunch is, you know, everybody has tilted again on, you know, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2425.2799999999997s)]
*  what we saw in the last couple prints. My suspicion, if you look at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2431.52s)]
*  the consensus view is that we're still heading in the direction of 4% faster than I think people [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2436.88s)]
*  emotionally think. So I would say there's maximum uncertainty in the world. The fear that inflation [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2443.84s)]
*  is uncapped, the way Larry Summers was articulate in November and December is less today than it was. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2451.12s)]
*  But what's emerged is this idea that we're going to have higher rates for longer, and we're going [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2457.36s)]
*  to have higher inflation for longer. Now, the question I throw back at you is the market abhors [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2462.4s)]
*  uncertainty. The market's done totally fine during periods where we had 3% inflation and 5.5% rates. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2469.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. When the internet boom that was, you know, 2000 to 2005 rates were a hell of a lot higher [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2477.92s)]
*  than the rates are today. So I don't think that higher rates and higher inflation means that we [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2484.4s)]
*  can't, you know, invest in venture-backed companies that have huge secular growth. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2491.36s)]
*  The world doesn't end. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2495.36s)]
*  But what I do think it means is like, if there's massive uncertainty in the world, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2496.88s)]
*  if allocators of capital don't know whether rates are going to double again, whether inflation's [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2501.84s)]
*  going to double again, then everything just shuts down. And that's really bad for the economy. I [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2507.76s)]
*  don't see that happening right now, but I do think that the prints over the course of the next eight [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2512.1600000000003s)]
*  weeks are going to be important. Chamath, do you have any macro thoughts here? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2516.4s)]
*  At the same time this is happening, we saw rents broke in the last month. So rents got cheaper. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2521.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2525.92s)]
*  A governing principle, I think I've probably said it too many times, but I'll say it again. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2526.56s)]
*  Rates are going to be higher than we like, and they'll stay here longer than we want. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2530.8s)]
*  So if you use that as a principle, whenever the consensus thinks we're done, it's been [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2536.08s)]
*  pretty profitable to be on the other side of consensus. And so I still kind of maintain that [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2543.12s)]
*  we're probably going to have a 5.5% Fed funds rate, which means that, I don't know, maybe credit [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2549.68s)]
*  suites will offer me 7.5% soon on three-month T-bills, but we're going to have higher rates. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2555.9199999999996s)]
*  And I do think Brad's right though, in the sense that as long as we know that then that's it and [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2560.64s)]
*  we can forecast it into the future without it changing too much, it'll be okay. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2565.9199999999996s)]
*  But right now what you're seeing is a lot of make-believe going on in the stock market. So Nick, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2572.7999999999997s)]
*  if you want to just throw up that image. So this is a really interesting- [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2579.2s)]
*  This is the chart of cash flow versus earnings? [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2584.56s)]
*  Yeah. So this is something that I saw in Bloomberg, which I thought was really interesting. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2587.3599999999997s)]
*  And if you focus on the period of 2020 to 2024, what you see is the white line, which is net income [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2591.4399999999996s)]
*  adjusted for depreciation and amortization. And the blue line is cash flows from operations. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2598.0s)]
*  So what does that mean? And this is for S&P 500 firms? [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2603.2799999999997s)]
*  This is the best 500 companies in the world. Yeah. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2608.24s)]
*  And the white line is what you tell Wall Street in terms of what you make on paper. The blue line [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2611.12s)]
*  is what actually appears in the bank account. So why could there be a gap between what you tell [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2619.2s)]
*  somebody you made? I made a dollar versus what's in the bank? 50 cents. Well, the reason is that [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2625.04s)]
*  there's all kinds of accounting tricks that you can use accruals, inventories, and all of these [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2630.56s)]
*  things allow you to present a healthier earnings report than is actually true. And so right now, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2637.36s)]
*  we have the worst earning situation. So the worst gap between what we are telling people versus what [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2646.08s)]
*  is actually in the bank account that we've had for 30 years since 1990. And so it just brings [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2653.2000000000003s)]
*  into focus the fact that we may be in the last few innings of trying to make sure this all looks [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2659.6s)]
*  okay. In which case, one faction of the investing world who thinks that this earnings recession is [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2666.96s)]
*  actually at hand would be kind of right. And then what they would say is that once we all realize [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2676.16s)]
*  that these earnings are fake, and you reset down 15%, that's where you get to the mid 3000 in the [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2681.92s)]
*  S&P 500. Right now, it's around 4000. I don't know if that's true or not. But there's more and more [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2688.88s)]
*  evidence that would support that the way that they see the world could be credible. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2695.12s)]
*  The other side says, Hey, listen, this is a bump in the road, we're getting a handle on things, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2701.68s)]
*  and it's stabilizing. So even though it's higher than we'd like, it's not going to change that much. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2707.52s)]
*  So now just think about 1015 years from now and let's go. And those are the folks that want to [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2711.68s)]
*  rip the money into growth stocks and tech stocks again, how does the consumer plan to all this [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2716.72s)]
*  record low unemployment, like it's 1% in Utah, three and a half percent for the country, two and [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2721.04s)]
*  a half jobs for every American who's unemployed. And then these rents coming down. But consumers [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2725.7599999999998s)]
*  have seemed to have burned off all that extra money they had. So Brad, when you look at the [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2732.56s)]
*  consumer driven economy that the world lives in, that's not true, because you have to understand, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2737.12s)]
*  stimulus is still entering the economy, it's just harder to measure. So for example, take [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2742.0s)]
*  Social Security, you have cost of living adjustments in Social Security, that's lifting [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2746.16s)]
*  payments by 10 and 15%, because it's backdated for what was going on last year. And remember, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2750.7999999999997s)]
*  last year, we had 2345% inflation rates. So there is more and more money coming into people's [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2755.8399999999997s)]
*  pockets that we don't realize. And we're all on the hook for that as US taxpayers. So I think it's [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2762.7999999999997s)]
*  very dangerous to kind of look at one data point and try to pick off what's happening in consumer [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2769.04s)]
*  land. Because there's all kinds of hidden ways in which money gets back to people. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2773.76s)]
*  Brad, you have thoughts on the consumer? Because, you know, I test it does seem like consumers are [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2778.88s)]
*  still spending money. But the cost of goods in some cases is coming down. I mean, how do you look [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2784.32s)]
*  at the consumer and try to make sense of what's going on here? Because it does seem the United [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2790.5600000000004s)]
*  States is in its own little bubble here world of just over employment. Still, even though we're [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2794.1600000000003s)]
*  seeing these layoffs in 10? Well, that I would say number one, that the pop we've seen in rates, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2800.8s)]
*  which impacts consumers by way of higher mortgages, higher variable expenses on their credit cards was [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2806.7200000000003s)]
*  offset over the last few months by lower energy costs. So their cost of gasoline went down. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2812.0s)]
*  Add in the things that Chamath's talking about. And I'm not sure you took a lot of money out of [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2816.96s)]
*  people's pockets. I would say this that again, what we're talking about here, retail sales have [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2820.96s)]
*  continued to do really well. Ecommerce sales in January were quite strong. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2826.24s)]
*  That would all be consistent with the soft landing. But here we are, you know, again, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2832.7999999999997s)]
*  talking about macro. I think when you spend this much time talking about macro doing what we do, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2837.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, like last year, I'll be the first to raise my hand and say, you know, like our friend [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2842.8799999999997s)]
*  Bill Gurley would say, it leads you in the wrong direction. The fact of the matter is it's totally [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2847.4399999999996s)]
*  unknown and unknowable where we're going to go over the course of the next three or four months. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2852.0s)]
*  I think there's a better ability to predict maybe over the course of the next couple of years. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2856.08s)]
*  But the fact is, if you would have told any, I was just with a bunch of investors, you probably [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2860.7999999999997s)]
*  represent a trillion dollars of public market demand, 10 or so long only investors. If you [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2866.08s)]
*  would have told any of them that the tenure was going to be at 396, they would have told you that [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2871.6s)]
*  the NASDAQ would be down 10% to start the year. And it did just the opposite. So I think you got, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2875.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, you're you have a bunch better chance to go if you're playing at home, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2881.2s)]
*  right, then trying to guess the direction of that find five companies that you think are going to [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2884.96s)]
*  grow and earn more money, irrespective of the direction of rates and inflation, own those [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2889.76s)]
*  and enjoy your life. I'm looking at the world and going, Sax, my lord, I'm seeing great founders, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2895.76s)]
*  great companies, and five to $10 million valuations, and I can buy five, 10, 15% of these [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2902.2400000000002s)]
*  companies. This feels like the best it's been for me as an angel investor seed investor, seed [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2907.76s)]
*  fund for a long time. This is fantastic. Great deal flow. The deals are taking six weeks to close. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2914.24s)]
*  We're having very thoughtful discussions. People are taking a real focused approach to how they [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2921.2s)]
*  deploy the capital. It is not Yolo people are building models. Again, people are showing their [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2926.72s)]
*  cat they're being thoughtful about how they spend the money. They're being thoughtful about salaries [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2931.7599999999998s)]
*  and hiring. So what what you seem to think that, you know, what we're seeing here is challenging [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2936.56s)]
*  or a problem. What are your thoughts on how it's affecting your day to day business as somebody who [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2944.08s)]
*  is a company builder? Well, let's separate two things. So there's the tech ecosystem, and there's [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2950.64s)]
*  the economy as a whole. The fact of the matter is that tech already had its bubble in 2021, it had [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2955.6s)]
*  its crash in 2022. And now we're largely on the other side of that. There's still a lot of companies [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2961.12s)]
*  like we talked about, they're gonna need to restructure, who raised during the bubble and [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2966.72s)]
*  may not have come to grips with that. But if you're talking about new investment, new rounds, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2970.48s)]
*  new companies are starting with a clean sheet of paper and a blank slate. You're right, things [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2975.04s)]
*  seem good and normal, right? People are making intelligent investments. And obviously, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2980.08s)]
*  the innovation cycle doesn't have anything to do with the macro picture. I mean, technology [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2985.68s)]
*  wants to evolve. And it's great engineers and product people who drive those ideas forward. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2990.56s)]
*  And they're not thinking about interest rates. I never thought about the Fed funds rate at all [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=2997.12s)]
*  when I was a founder running companies. So let's just put that aside and acknowledge that [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3002.24s)]
*  great innovations gonna keep happening, no matter what the macro economic picture looks like. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3006.96s)]
*  That being said, I mean, just for the listeners of the show, who aren't startup founders, I tend to [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3012.7999999999997s)]
*  be a little bit gloomy about the macro picture right now. Because yeah, it's true that what Brad [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3018.7999999999997s)]
*  said that we've had good economies with 5% rates before. But I think you also have to look at the [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3024.08s)]
*  pace of change or the rate at which the Fed funds rate has been going up. And if you look at the [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3030.16s)]
*  chart of rate increases, it is a very steep chart of rate increases. And I just think that [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3036.16s)]
*  for the last decade or so, we've been operating in this like zero interest rate or ZERP environment [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3044.3199999999997s)]
*  with lots of monetary stimulus. And I think a lot of companies, a lot of parts of the economy [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3048.96s)]
*  got addicted to that stimulus, they got hooked on drugs. Now all of a sudden, you're putting them [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3056.96s)]
*  through withdrawal very, very quickly. And obviously, the withdrawal pangs are going to be worse [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3063.12s)]
*  if you can't taper off slowly. So it looked like just a few weeks ago that the Fed was done raising [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3068.4s)]
*  rates. Now we know that they're not. We don't really know when they're going to stop. So I tend [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3074.16s)]
*  to be a little bit gloomy with respect to the big macro picture. Because I just don't see how [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3079.92s)]
*  you can change rates this fast. And I mean, you look at like real estate, for example, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3087.68s)]
*  we just saw the first year over year decrease in the housing market in a while. And again, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3091.92s)]
*  that's all driven by rates, the cost of mortgages going up. And two big defaults and the first two [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3097.92s)]
*  big defaults. Yeah. So I think that there's going to be some pain ahead. Now, you know, ironically, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3103.28s)]
*  from the standpoint of the tech ecosystem, we may have already taken our medicine. And we may already [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3109.76s)]
*  be on the other side. Actually, that is a good way to look at as we took the medicine. It's painful. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3114.96s)]
*  What to do with Jason, maybe that's the segue to talking about Benioff. I would say we haven't [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3120.5600000000004s)]
*  took it. We're taking it. We're starting to take our medicine. Well, it makes sense that Benioff [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3126.4s)]
*  with his you know, very [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3132.24s)]
*  loving family kind of approach to running the company might actually it might take him a little [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3136.16s)]
*  while to become a big cutthroat. So as everybody knows, Benioff and Salesforce have had a lot of [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3141.52s)]
*  turnover, a lot of senior executives have left voluntary or involuntary. But shares were up 11% [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3150.0s)]
*  on Thursday after reporting their Q4 earnings, they're up 14% year over year, small net loss. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3157.68s)]
*  But the company bought back $2.3 billion worth of its stock, we're going to see more of that for [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3164.9599999999996s)]
*  sure. And they're going to be increasing its share buyback program to $20 billion going forward. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3169.9199999999996s)]
*  And like Metta, which suddenly got fit and got religion, Benioff is now basically with all these [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3177.2799999999997s)]
*  activists, I guess, on on his ass, he says, in this is the quote from the earnings call, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3185.68s)]
*  we're more closely scrutinizing every dollar of investment and resource and very focused on [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3192.96s)]
*  driving operational excellence and automation across our business focusing on four key areas, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3197.6s)]
*  short long term expense for structuring employee productivity, there it is, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3202.16s)]
*  product innovation and building relationships with shareholders. Profitability is our truly our [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3207.04s)]
*  number one strategy. And that's my number one strategy. That's the number one thing we talked [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3212.88s)]
*  about at the start of every meeting we have in this company, quite a turnaround your thoughts, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3216.88s)]
*  Brad? I don't think the story is that, you know, that Benioff, you know, made these cuts and that [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3223.04s)]
*  activists are around the rim, what was significant was his comments that he made. And I tweeted about [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3228.96s)]
*  it today, you know, he said, every CEO in Silicon Valley has looked at what Elon Musk has done, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3235.28s)]
*  and asked themselves, do they need to unleash their own Elon within them? And, you know, listen, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3241.28s)]
*  we've been talking about this for nine months. The reality is, if you look at the employee count at [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3248.48s)]
*  Salesforce, in 2015, they had 19,000 employees. As of last year, they had 80,000. In seven years, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3254.0800000000004s)]
*  they for x the number of employees, they were a mature company. By 2015, their employees cagered [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3264.1600000000003s)]
*  at 23%. You know, we don't talk about it in this way. But these large companies, these employee [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3270.16s)]
*  bases, they're not unions, but they may as well be. Right? Why would they be? I just think there's [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3276.64s)]
*  there there is during this age of excess, where it was just easy for people to hire more people [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3284.3999999999996s)]
*  and build more things not to make tough choices, etc. Right? We just had an explosion like we've [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3291.52s)]
*  never seen in Silicon Valley, in the number of employees in these businesses, meta went from [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3297.68s)]
*  10,000 to 80, 85,000, Google went to 185,000. And at those levels, it's very difficult to [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3303.04s)]
*  govern them. And when the CEOs went to make decisions in the businesses, there would be [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3312.16s)]
*  protests, revolts within the business 30 or 40,000 people would sign petitions even say no, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3318.16s)]
*  we're not going to the office. No, we're not going to work three days a week. No, you can't name our [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3324.3199999999997s)]
*  AI bot, what you want to name it because it offends us. And so to me, what's more significant [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3329.8399999999997s)]
*  is over the last six months, we've seen courage gain momentum in Silicon Valley. Right? What's [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3337.52s)]
*  deeply underappreciated about meta and the changes they made, it would be one thing if it was just [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3344.64s)]
*  window dressing, we cut 10% of the workforce kind of tighten our better belt a little bit. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3350.48s)]
*  But Zuckerberg got on his call, and he said, we only have two priorities in 2023. One is efficiency, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3355.52s)]
*  and he went into depth about once they started cutting people, how the company got faster, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3362.16s)]
*  the product release cycle sped up, the employees got happier. And now it's an end in itself to [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3368.16s)]
*  delay or the business. That's what we're hearing out of Benny off as well. And I think [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3374.64s)]
*  it's you know, people can quibble with how Elon went about the change, which you and you and [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3380.56s)]
*  David are very familiar with at Twitter. But the reality is, he lit a fuse in Silicon Valley that [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3387.92s)]
*  is giving courage, whether it's private companies, series B companies, pre IPO companies, public [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3394.0s)]
*  companies, I've had that conversation more times than you can imagine over the course of the last [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3400.88s)]
*  six months. And I think it's a really important change, because I think it breathes new productivity [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3406.88s)]
*  into all these businesses. And importantly, it unleashes these engineers back into the ecosystem [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3412.1600000000003s)]
*  to start the next wave of companies. Yeah, so Jason, I mean, you and I got to tag along with [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3418.1600000000003s)]
*  Elon during that transition phase at Twitter. And the thing that I took away from it was just how [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3422.96s)]
*  much agency, you know, CEOs have that they're not using. I mean, Elon went in there, and he [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3429.52s)]
*  basically changed whatever he saw that he didn't like. I mean, unsentimentally and quickly. And, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3437.28s)]
*  you know, and so you look at all these other companies, you talk to CEO sometimes, and they [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3444.48s)]
*  act like they're prisoners of their companies, like, I can't change this, I can't change that. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3449.12s)]
*  Stockholm syndrome, yeah. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3454.08s)]
*  It's like, you know, I've got all these employees and all these layers, and but I can't, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3455.4399999999996s)]
*  you know, there's always some reason I'm afraid of the bad PR or, you know, whatever it is. And I, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3459.68s)]
*  you know, the thing I came away realizing is just how much agency, particularly founder CEOs have, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3464.96s)]
*  that they just don't use, you know, they're always like hemming and hawing and wringing their hands, [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3471.9199999999996s)]
*  and acting like they're tied down by this or that. And the reality is they can do whatever they want [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3476.24s)]
*  just about, you know, within the bounds of what's legal. And I think they're starting to realize, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3481.12s)]
*  oh, wait a second, like, I actually can do that. You know, I can walk into my company one day, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3488.3199999999997s)]
*  and if there's a team that's not performing, that's giving me answers that don't make any sense. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3492.48s)]
*  I can start over. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3497.04s)]
*  I'm just going to start over. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3498.56s)]
*  Yeah, reboot. I mean, if you can't get it done, then we need to have somebody who can do it. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3499.92s)]
*  And it's incredible. Like, we were doing an analysis on this week in startups of the, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3504.88s)]
*  you know, employees per company and the revenue per employee per headcount. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3510.4s)]
*  And I got roasted for having this call, even having this conversation. And now here we are, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3515.84s)]
*  Chamath. People are looking at efficiency. We're looking at, you know, really, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3520.4s)]
*  how efficient can these companies be run? Is there a limit to where this is going? And if we were to [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3526.2400000000002s)]
*  look at this as a process, where are the fangs, the Amazons, the Googles, Facebooks, where are [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3533.12s)]
*  they at in terms of percentage to being at Elon? If you were to put Twitter and Elon as the [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3538.8s)]
*  goal, where are these companies? And I don't know that that is the goal. Maybe he's cut too much. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3548.1600000000003s)]
*  Who knows? We'll find out. I think it's a pretty radical experiment he's doing there. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3552.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. I don't think that's a reasonable or an achievable goal for a public company. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3556.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, I think the thing we have to keep in mind is Elon's also capable of doing that because [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3563.76s)]
*  he paid $44 billion of his own money to buy something that he owns outright, that no longer [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3568.48s)]
*  has revenue pressure to outside stakeholders, different circumstance, revenue went down 70% [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3573.6s)]
*  to Twitter. Well, that only affects him and his ability to pay whatever he borrowed in order to [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3579.68s)]
*  buy that company. And as long as he's willing to fund that somehow, he's literally allowed to do [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3585.04s)]
*  whatever he wants. That's no longer the case when you're borrowing money from other people to build [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3589.76s)]
*  your business, which is what every other capital market participant does, public market participant [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3594.96s)]
*  does, and private market participant. So I think that that distinction is just a little bit [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3600.48s)]
*  important because it probably means that there is a shadow of what Elon is doing that's probably [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3604.7200000000003s)]
*  the threshold of what's possible. And it's probably, you know, sort of 50% headcount reduction. That's [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3611.04s)]
*  probably the the bound in which things break. Because I think the thing to keep in mind is that [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3618.3199999999997s)]
*  over time, this stuff is like collagen in the body, it just like, it creates these interconnected [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3626.64s)]
*  webs of just very difficult stuff that you send you that you cannot tease apart blockages. So even [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3633.3599999999997s)]
*  if you tried to go in and cut 50% of a company like Facebook or Google or Microsoft or Apple or [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3640.0s)]
*  Amazon, it would be so difficult, because all of a sudden, the coordination that happens at that [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3647.2s)]
*  scale, I think would get lost. So I'm not sure if it's possible, you kind of have to do what they're [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3652.96s)]
*  doing, which is cut 5%, then cut 10%, then cut 5%, then cut 5%. And I know it frustrates people on [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3658.72s)]
*  the outside looking in, but I think it's the, it's probably the only way it can be done without [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3665.3599999999997s)]
*  torpedoing the company. What does that do on a culture basis then, because that is the big [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3670.72s)]
*  critique, hey, you're creating now this culture of fear, I guess the opposite of that is you're [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3675.28s)]
*  creating a culture of performance and expectation. So how do you think about it on a culture basis, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3678.88s)]
*  because that keeps coming up from founders to David's point, it depends, because I think [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3682.96s)]
*  companies when they're smaller, I mean, I can tell you, when I was a part of the Facebook Senior [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3686.96s)]
*  Management team, we would rank all the employees. So we had a very good sense of who was the best [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3693.6800000000003s)]
*  and the most performant all the way down to who was not. And we were able to do that, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3700.48s)]
*  probably up to two or 3000 employees. That's not possible at 50,000. And nor is it fair. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3704.5600000000004s)]
*  So because you don't know who these folks are, the real contributors are, you have to do what [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3710.5600000000004s)]
*  Elon did, which is literally go person to person and say, who is unbelievably performant, or [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3715.76s)]
*  critical. Yeah. In the absence of doing that, you just don't know who to let go. And so you have no [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3722.88s)]
*  choice except to bleed down the question that I have. And Brad, maybe there's a smart analyst [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3728.5600000000004s)]
*  on your team that can do it is right. And it's more of a statement as well. Can you imagine [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3733.44s)]
*  the totality of stock based comp that's been given out by all these companies since 2015, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3738.56s)]
*  when they were cagering their employee bases by 25% a year, I bet you it's a trillion and a half [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3744.8s)]
*  dollars at least. You think it's that you think it's in that order magnitude? 100% This has been [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3752.4s)]
*  the greatest grift in the history of Silicon Valley for sure. Let's pause for a second. Can [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3758.08s)]
*  you explain what we're talking about here? Stock based compensation obviously is the stock given [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3763.2s)]
*  to employees. It's generally not counted. Well, let's do it this way. Let's just say that you [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3767.7599999999998s)]
*  believe in capitalism. Okay. Yep. So if you if you believe in capitalism, let's say the, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3774.48s)]
*  the four of us start a company, and there's a dollar of profit, and we each own 25% of the company. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3779.84s)]
*  Got it. Normally, what you would say is each of us get 25 cents. Right? Reasonable. We own 25% each, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3786.8s)]
*  there's a dollar profit, we each have 20. So that means that in four years, right, we each will have [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3795.84s)]
*  made $1. Because so let's just say it costs $1 to get off the ground or $4 to get off the ground. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3800.48s)]
*  All in summit budget, we believe. We all would have been made whole, we all would feel great. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3804.96s)]
*  And then now every year afterwards, that 25 cents we get as profit. Now let's say that, Jason, you [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3809.28s)]
*  add a fifth person, and Brad and David and I can't say anything about it. Okay. And that fifth person [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3815.68s)]
*  now gets a fifth of it. Right. And so now all of a sudden, our 25 cents goes down to 20 cents. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3822.48s)]
*  Then let's say you add five more people now all of a sudden, our 25 cents went to 20. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3829.68s)]
*  And then it went to 10 cents. Yeah. And at some point, Brad and David and I raise our hand and [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3835.6s)]
*  say, Hey, this is not the deal we signed up for. And you say, well, too bad, because revenue would [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3841.6s)]
*  not be what it is. And profits would not be what it is without these extra six people. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3847.7599999999998s)]
*  And that's effectively what everybody debates when they own a stock, the shareholders [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3854.64s)]
*  want that number to be as small as possible. And I think what Brad is observing is that in Silicon [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3859.6s)]
*  Valley, what has happened is there's been poor accountability for what all of those extra people [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3867.12s)]
*  do. And profits haven't risen fast enough to make the existing three people on the cap table feel [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3872.24s)]
*  okay about it. And that instead of talking about three people and six, and a dollar, you're talking [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3879.6s)]
*  about trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of extra shareholders, millions of [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3886.24s)]
*  extra shareholders. And now we have some charts here so we can do some fun with numbers. I think [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3891.84s)]
*  taking a step back, I think it's very important to realize that stock as a form of compensation [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3896.4s)]
*  to create alignment, excitement in the early stage of venture capital is part of the true magic of [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3903.2000000000003s)]
*  Silicon Valley. You know, you're starting a company, you ask somebody to go on this adventure, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3909.6s)]
*  take a bunch of risks. They often have to cut their pay, they could get a Google by half [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3914.32s)]
*  to join your adventure. It's only fair that you give them stock in the company and they share [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3919.6800000000003s)]
*  the ups and if the company smokes it, they get rich for taking that incremental risk on their [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3923.52s)]
*  behalf and on their family's behalf. What's happened over the last 15 years is something [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3929.36s)]
*  totally different, which is this stock as a form of early stage compensation, right, continued. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3935.68s)]
*  And there's a feature in Silicon Valley as companies came public, one way to kind of hide [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3944.4s)]
*  an expense in a business is to bury it in SBC. So let's say Google wanted to hire somebody for [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3952.32s)]
*  $4 million, which they're doing today in AI. But instead of paying them $4 million in cash, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3958.4s)]
*  which would all count against their operating profit, they give them $500,000 in cash and [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3964.8s)]
*  $3.5 million in stock. And let's say they make all that stock vestible immediately, Jason, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3970.7200000000003s)]
*  in this year. It's obvious to you and I that's just cash. The person turns around and sells it [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3976.2400000000002s)]
*  to real expense of the business, real expense to the shareholders. But when they report their [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3981.36s)]
*  earnings and they report adjusted EBITDA, they adjust out the $3.5 million that they gave by [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3985.76s)]
*  way of SBC. Why did stock based comp SBC get excluded from accounting? What is the history [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3992.56s)]
*  of that? And is that going to change now? Are people going to say, and shareholders demand [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=3999.76s)]
*  in this new economy, in this new sort of reality, hey, you know what? You can't play [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4004.8s)]
*  fun with numbers here. Stock based comp has to come out. What would you like to see, Brad? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4009.92s)]
*  It's fairly esoteric. But there back in the mid 2000s, 2004, 2005, there was an accounting, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4014.64s)]
*  there was a big debate about this. Warren Buffett was famously saying, listen, it doesn't matter [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4021.28s)]
*  whether you pay in stock, whether you pay in cash, whether you pay in cans of beers, like it all costs [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4026.32s)]
*  the same. He's right. And so there was a debate. We had a statement, an accounting statement, FASB [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4032.64s)]
*  123. And in that statement, it said gap EBITDA must include the cost of stock based compensation. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4038.88s)]
*  So all of a sudden, if I'm reporting gap EBITDA, I got to include the cost of stock comp, which it [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4048.32s)]
*  does today. But what did everybody do? But what happened? They started adjusting it out, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4052.88s)]
*  right? Because they said, hey, this is a real expense, right? Because we're not, it's not cash, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4062.96s)]
*  we're giving out the door. So all in, do they come up with a term for this? [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4068.24s)]
*  Adjusted EBITDA. And the crime here is that when rates fell to zero, and everybody was making money [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4071.04s)]
*  on tech stocks, nobody wanted to rock this boat. And everybody just said, you know, like adjusted [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4084.56s)]
*  EBITDA kind of ignored, I can, I can model it into my future dilution. So we model a share count over [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4090.3999999999996s)]
*  the course of the next three years. But this literally over the last five years, went parabolic. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4097.12s)]
*  Because I just shared with you the number of employees exploded, the amount of share based [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4103.76s)]
*  compensation exploded. I think it's a competition for those employees, we would say base, I think [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4109.44s)]
*  just reported SBC, which hold your hat, sax was 70% of revenue, not 70% of their earnings, 70% [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4114.64s)]
*  of their revenue. Just for Coinbase we're talking about here. That's for Coinbase. And so, you know, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4126.48s)]
*  last week, there was something that I thought was pretty brave. Booking.com on their earnings call, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4132.32s)]
*  really called this out. And what they said is, listen, we've been playing by the rules. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4139.599999999999s)]
*  We understand that stock based comp is cash. And they say every every metric we report includes [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4146.719999999999s)]
*  the impact of stock based compensation. And if you look over the last 15 years, [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4154.24s)]
*  if I'm an owner of booking.com, I was only diluted by about 5%. If I was an owner of Salesforce, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4158.96s)]
*  or Expedia, I was diluted by about 25%. That's 25% of my ups were given away. Right. But yet, [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4167.76s)]
*  those things were adjusted out when they reported earnings. And so, you know, what's become in vogue [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4177.52s)]
*  today is CFOs get on their calls. And they said, No, no, no, no, don't worry, we're going to buy [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4183.92s)]
*  back a lot of shares. So we won't have much dilution. Okay. But if you take my 2 billion [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4188.56s)]
*  of profits that Chema just talked about, and it goes right out the door, just to buy back the shares [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4195.040000000001s)]
*  you just issued, you're effectively round tripping that money, then it just proves the point. It's [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4200.88s)]
*  cash. It's an expense to shareholders. And my biggest problem with it is it's led to [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4205.92s)]
*  the bloat. Because if companies actually had to account for this as cash, right, as a [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4213.4400000000005s)]
*  bit of doing to be able to do it, they wouldn't hire as many people, they wouldn't pay as much [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4220.72s)]
*  in stock comp. And I'll end with this because I want to end with the solution. Every comp committee [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4225.92s)]
*  on every board, frankly, their heads spin when you start talking about this subject. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4233.6s)]
*  They bring in a comp consultant. And the comp consultant, they is really the CYA for the comp [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4238.88s)]
*  committee. Because they want to approve a comp plan that's been recommended by the management [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4245.6s)]
*  team. And they just want to know is this what everybody else is doing? Okay. So everybody's [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4250.400000000001s)]
*  doing it. So the comp consultant looks around and says, Yeah, all your peers are doing this. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4255.92s)]
*  This is why Charlie Munger said I'd rather throw a pit viper down the front of my shirt than hire [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4259.92s)]
*  a comp consultant. Right? What is going on on these comp committees? If you give bonuses to anybody [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4265.36s)]
*  in your business that are that is based on an adjusted EBITDA metric, rather than free cash flow [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4271.76s)]
*  per share per share is the key here. It's negligence. It's negligence. So if companies just walk in and [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4280.24s)]
*  they say the gold standard as a public company is 50 basis points, annual dilution, that's Apple, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4288.08s)]
*  that's booking.com, Beeson, MasterCard, or even below that. That's the gold standard once you're [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4294.5599999999995s)]
*  in the public markets. And we will never incentivize our employees on the basis of anything that [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4299.6s)]
*  excludes stock comp. And it has to be on a per share basis. That would be a massive leap forward [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4306.8s)]
*  for public company accounts. Seems reasonable. Anybody have any other thoughts on that stock [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4313.36s)]
*  based comp? No. All right, Sacks, where do you want to go? You want to go Fox? I'm willing to do [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4317.2s)]
*  Fox. Let's do Fox. I mean, Fox is kind of crazy. Okay, so Rupert Murdoch had been deposed here with [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4322.16s)]
*  this Dominion voting system lawsuit. They're suing Fox for 1.6 billion in damages over claims [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4328.639999999999s)]
*  made on air that we all know around technology enabled election fraud. We remember this [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4336.4s)]
*  wild period at the end of the last election cycle with this incredibly false claim that the election [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4342.72s)]
*  was stolen. Something, you know, both sides of the aisle said did not happen. However, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4348.48s)]
*  it seems that the hosts on Fox knew it wasn't happening, knew it wasn't true, but were engaging [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4356.4s)]
*  in entertainment of allowing these people to come on air and say the election was stolen. So Murdoch [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4363.04s)]
*  said, I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it in hindsight. And when asked if he [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4368.56s)]
*  could have stopped the host from highlighting these allegations, these false allegations on air [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4376.400000000001s)]
*  that were obvious to everybody. He said I could have, but I didn't. He said the truth. He's not [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4380.320000000001s)]
*  allowed to lie in court. Yeah, just on air, but not in court. I mean, Sacks, to be fair, like, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4384.64s)]
*  you really care about freedom of speech. You really care about the libel laws. You really care [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4390.56s)]
*  about the GOP. Obviously, you bring it up every week here. So when you looked at and but you were [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4396.72s)]
*  very clear, you were not happy about the election denial, all that like false claims that Trump made [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4402.4800000000005s)]
*  and these insane people he put around himself. So how do you look at these Fox hosts and listen, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4408.8s)]
*  you've been on Tucker and other things, knowingly spreading lies about something as important as [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4414.400000000001s)]
*  the election, and then doing it in the most cynical ways we sit here and every week we roast [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4421.6s)]
*  the media, the mainstream media, you particularly go after the Dems and the left and the media elites. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4427.68s)]
*  How do you feel about these media elites who are part of the GOP machine, lying incessantly [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4432.320000000001s)]
*  about something as important as the election integrity of the United States of America? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4439.200000000001s)]
*  First of all, you're trying to tee this up as some giant dunk on me, J. Cal. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4444.96s)]
*  No, I'm not. You said from the beginning. You said from the beginning you didn't believe in this. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4448.879999999999s)]
*  Exactly. Let's go back to November of 2020 on this show because there may be a lot of [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4453.44s)]
*  parts of the audience that weren't watching back then. I was really clear that I said Sidney Powell [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4458.5599999999995s)]
*  and Lynn Wood and Rudy Giuliani. I thought they were wackos and this whole idea that the Dominion [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4463.28s)]
*  voting machines had somehow been rigged and somehow it involved Hugo Chavez was a wild [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4471.12s)]
*  conspiracy theory. I said at the time- 100%. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4475.92s)]
*  And I also said that I thought that once the Supreme Court denied certiorari to Trump, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4478.56s)]
*  I said that he had his right to have his day in court and to challenge the election in court, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4485.36s)]
*  but once the court threw out his claims and the Supreme Court denied certiorari, that whole thing [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4490.88s)]
*  needed to stop. It didn't stop and that's why the Republicans lost that Purdue runoff seat in Georgia [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4496.56s)]
*  January 5th and then you had January 6th. I've been warning against this for a long time, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4503.04s)]
*  J. Cal. Now with respect to Fox, I think you need to basically get a little bit more nuanced in what [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4507.4400000000005s)]
*  you're saying there because I think within Fox there were actually two groups of hosts. There [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4513.52s)]
*  is one group of hosts that I think you could say were Trump loyalists and they basically not only [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4518.56s)]
*  platformed the Sidney Powell lies, but also endorsed them. Rupert Murdoch admitted that they [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4525.12s)]
*  went too far and actually endorsed. And so you had Hannity and a couple other hosts do that, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4531.12s)]
*  even though Hannity had some text messages that indicated he didn't believe it. So I think he [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4536.0s)]
*  came across the worst. However, there were within Fox skeptics of the Sidney Powell theory. And so [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4540.08s)]
*  I'd put Tucker Carlson in that camp. I put Laurie Ingram in that camp and Tucker had Sidney Powell [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4546.64s)]
*  on his show on, I think it was November 19th. I think this was 16 days after the election. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4552.4s)]
*  It was a 20 minute interview in which he grilled her and he kept coming back to what is your [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4558.08s)]
*  evidence? What is your proof? And if you were paying attention, he demolished her. I mean, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4562.5599999999995s)]
*  I remember that notable. Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, honestly, no one looks great when all of [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4567.28s)]
*  your text messages come out and you can nitpick about this or that text. But the bottom line is, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4571.76s)]
*  I think Tucker did his job. Yes, he platforms Sidney Powell, but he platformed her in order [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4576.24s)]
*  to dismantle her. And you kind of have to be pretty dopey not to see that she was dismantled [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4581.36s)]
*  after the appearance of Tucker. Should Fox be liable for knowingly platforming these people [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4587.28s)]
*  and endorsing them in some way? Or is it their freedom of speech in your mind, as an attorney [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4593.92s)]
*  here or somebody with that, you know, legal degree? Where does this stand? Like put aside, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4600.0s)]
*  if this was if this was CNN doing it, MSNBC will switch what publication if this was the New York [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4606.639999999999s)]
*  Times and they knowingly lied, knowingly platformed some kooks with a conspiracy theory, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4611.36s)]
*  what should the price they pay for and then how does that affect the freedom of speech that we [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4617.759999999999s)]
*  all think I think universally on this podcast, especially and in Silicon Valley, or at least we [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4622.5599999999995s)]
*  used to that freedom of speech is really important. Do you have the freedom to lie and platform [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4627.28s)]
*  kooks like this? Let me ask you directly, Jason, I think this would be a better world if Fox reliable, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4632.32s)]
*  but I don't think they're going to be because that's not the legal standard. I believe that [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4637.12s)]
*  if a television network knowingly spreads and endorses baseless accusations against somebody, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4640.56s)]
*  which they know or should know is basically untrue, I think they should absolutely be liable [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4648.64s)]
*  for libel or defamation. But that is not what the law requires under New York Times versus Sullivan, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4653.84s)]
*  you're required to show that that they knowingly spread misinformation. But in addition, you have [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4658.320000000001s)]
*  to show that they had actual malice, which is that their intent was malicious. And I think, [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4663.280000000001s)]
*  Rupert Murdoch is a wily old dog because he admitted on the stand everything but the thing [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4669.84s)]
*  that was most important for the plaintiffs to prove, which is actual malice. He admitted [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4675.92s)]
*  that they platform things that they knew or should have known were false. He admitted that he should [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4681.04s)]
*  have put a lid on it sooner. He admitted that he knew it wasn't true, but he said the reason they [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4686.4800000000005s)]
*  did it is because they're afraid of their audience or a portion of their audience going to some rival [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4690.72s)]
*  network. So basically, what he said is, in not so many words, is that his motivation was greed. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4695.76s)]
*  And in our system of law, that is a complete defense against claims of defamation. Now, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4701.360000000001s)]
*  I think what we need here is to rewrite the defamation laws. I think the Supreme Court [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4706.24s)]
*  needs to overturn New York versus Sullivan. Clarence Thomas is basically intimated that he [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4710.400000000001s)]
*  would support that. I think that would be a great thing to do. I think actual malice should not be [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4715.76s)]
*  the requirement for libel. I think if a television network or a publication puts out information [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4720.72s)]
*  they know is false, they should absolutely be liable for it, and that is enough to show. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4726.4800000000005s)]
*  And if we did that, by the way, it wouldn't just be Fox in this particular case. It'd be CNN and [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4730.64s)]
*  MSNBC would have to completely revise their coverage. And all of these tech reporters who [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4736.08s)]
*  do nothing but defame the tech industry, the entire tech press just about, is a slow moving [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4740.400000000001s)]
*  defamation lawsuit. Elon Musk would probably be the richest man in the world just based on [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4746.96s)]
*  all the defamation lawsuits he could bring if we were to overturn New York Times versus Sullivan. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4750.96s)]
*  The richest, richer guy? [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4755.6s)]
*  Yeah, because all they do is defame Elon Musk every week with claims that are ridiculous. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4757.04s)]
*  So David, David. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4763.68s)]
*  So listen, let's revise the whole thing. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4764.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but okay, so hold on. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4765.76s)]
*  There you go, folks. Very, very intellectually honest. I like it. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4766.96s)]
*  David, so what you're saying is you expect the Dominion lawsuit to fail. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4769.92s)]
*  Can it be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court? Can this be the case that rewrites New [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4774.72s)]
*  York versus Sullivan? [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4779.4400000000005s)]
*  Good question. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4780.400000000001s)]
*  That's a good question. I'm not sure. I mean, I think that'd be great if it did. Just to be clear, [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4781.280000000001s)]
*  listen, I think that if Fox were somehow found guilty, I think one and a half billion is a kind [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4784.88s)]
*  of a ridiculous amount of damages. I don't think Dominion was damaged to one and a half billion. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4789.360000000001s)]
*  But do I think that it would be a good thing if this lawsuit were challenged all the way to [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4793.360000000001s)]
*  the Supreme Court and they overruled New York Times versus Sullivan? [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4798.320000000001s)]
*  Let's fund the lawsuit. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4800.88s)]
*  That'd be a great thing. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4801.84s)]
*  Let's fund the lawsuit. I would find that a great thing. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4802.320000000001s)]
*  I would fund that lawsuit. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4804.56s)]
*  But the next thing I want to do is sue MSNBC and CNN for all the nonsense they spread every night. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4805.360000000001s)]
*  And just to be clear, I have a couple of things that I would want to go and get correct. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4812.160000000001s)]
*  Clean up. I just want to be clear here though, Brad. David's guy, Tucker, he did the right thing. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4817.280000000001s)]
*  That's the most important part of the story, isn't it, David? You're still a sucker for Tucker. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4823.200000000001s)]
*  You're not being nuanced. You want to throw Tucker under the bus. I think Tucker did his job. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4828.080000000001s)]
*  I think Tucker did his job. Yes. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4832.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think the guy who looks a little worse is Hannity because Hannity, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4836.72s)]
*  in the text admitted he didn't believe the story, but as a Trump loyalist, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4840.08s)]
*  he endorsed the bullshit theory. That's no good. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4843.52s)]
*  Brad, you come on the show every couple of episodes and pitch in here as our fifth beetle. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4846.48s)]
*  Would you like to touch the third rail? What are your thoughts? And would you like to get [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4852.32s)]
*  some incoming email from all your LPs about your position on Fox News and Trump? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4856.64s)]
*  Would you like to email me? I mean, I just feel like I sat through the University of Chicago [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4861.2s)]
*  law school class. It was awesome. And I think we have some good issues here. We still got to tick [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4868.639999999999s)]
*  off on JCal. Yes. Okay. Well- We got to talk just for a second about China as it relates to TikTok. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4874.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, okay. All right. Here we go. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4881.44s)]
*  This Hawley hearing that's coming up. So we've got a hearing in Congress. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4883.599999999999s)]
*  Let's start with you are a shareholder, a significant shareholder in ByteDance, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4888.08s)]
*  the parent company of TikTok. We have to say that I'm correct. Correct. Correct. And you, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4892.16s)]
*  you started that position- And my kids use TikTok and my kids use Reels and- [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4896.4s)]
*  Everybody- You and I have had a spirited debate on- [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4900.08s)]
*  Yes. You're a shareholder. Okay. So- [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4902.719999999999s)]
*  On Twitter about this. So I haven't interested- You want me to tee it up or you want to tee it up? [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4904.4s)]
*  Well, hold on a second here. Like, because just like Sax had to defend himself before [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4907.44s)]
*  he even got started. Otherwise you under my credibility- You don't like the way I explain it. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4911.28s)]
*  I have to do the same thing. I'm a much bigger shareholder of Metta, who stands to do incredibly [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4915.36s)]
*  well if TikTok in the US is banned. So you have a spread trend. Wait, you win either way. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4922.16s)]
*  I've got a hedge on. Good. Okay. You know, if TikTok in the US gets banned. But you know, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4928.0s)]
*  the context here is the TikTok ban debate is heating up, right? And it's all in a march up [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4933.679999999999s)]
*  to the Hawley hearing. I think it's on March 23rd. And there's real- Like we spent a lot of [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4941.92s)]
*  time at the start of this pod on inflation. I think a much bigger issue right now. I was just [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4947.92s)]
*  with all these investors. The main issue on their mind was global decoupling between China and the [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4952.72s)]
*  United States. We're going to see a level of Chinese hate leveled out of Congress, both sides. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4958.08s)]
*  I mean, we heard it, Chamath, at dinner at your place not so long ago, that this hearing is [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4967.28s)]
*  drawing more demand for speakers from both sides of the aisle than any such conference in a long [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4971.92s)]
*  time. But there's a lot of there's a lot of heat now around TikTok. Should it be banned? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4978.0s)]
*  And when I look at the situation, if you frame it for ByteDance, because Chamath talked about [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4983.76s)]
*  this a couple of weeks ago, it's been reported. ByteDance's revenue is about $120 billion. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4990.0s)]
*  It's been reported their profits are about $25 billion. That is almost identical in size [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=4995.68s)]
*  to Metta. Metta is worth about $450 billion. So $120 billion top line. It's also been leaked [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5002.4800000000005s)]
*  that TikTok is about $14 billion of that. And that US TikTok is $3 to $4 billion. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5008.64s)]
*  US TikTok $3 to $4 billion of $120 billion and it loses money. So there's a lot of debate. Should [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5016.88s)]
*  we ban it? Should we not ban it? Is it going to go public? What do you think? What do you want to [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5024.8s)]
*  happen as a shareholder? Listen, I think it's a American. I think this is a puppet debate over a [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5028.96s)]
*  much bigger conversation that's going on. One of the things I've urged the company to do over the [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5034.4800000000005s)]
*  course of the last several years is parental controls. My kids use TikTok, they use reels, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5039.76s)]
*  and what I want is to be able to set effective time limits. And I also want TikTok has incredible [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5046.16s)]
*  video content in math, in science, in history. I want to be able to set a slider and say 20% [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5052.32s)]
*  of the videos that get shown over this one hour period have to include some of these math and [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5058.48s)]
*  science videos for my 12 year old. Then he can elect to not watch it all or watch it. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5063.36s)]
*  They announced those product changes yesterday. So they're teeing up those product changes. I [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5068.4s)]
*  don't happen to think there's a nefarious plot, but I also understand that people might not want [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5074.48s)]
*  this. And so like, listen, I think we should have a debate. I think that the CEO of TikTok [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5080.56s)]
*  should show up. He should speak the truth at the Hally hearing. And if the US Congress wants to [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5085.04s)]
*  ban TikTok in the US or force a spin or a sale, I think we should do it and stop debating it. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5090.240000000001s)]
*  But the much larger conversation is whether we have a hard or a soft decoupling with China. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5095.4400000000005s)]
*  And I think this is just canary in the colon. All right. So let me just tee up also, [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5101.92s)]
*  and Chamath, I'll get your reaction. On Monday, the White House gave government agencies 30 days [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5106.88s)]
*  to remove TikTok from all federal devices. All federal agencies must delete TikTok from phones [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5111.2s)]
*  and systems and prohibit internet traffic from reaching the company. This is following moves [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5115.76s)]
*  by Canada and the EU and Taiwan. And obviously, there is a bigger House Committee focus on China [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5119.84s)]
*  that held its first meeting this week. So there is the bigger picture. But let's start [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5129.679999999999s)]
*  with the smaller picture. Number one, Chamath, do you think it's a security risk to have a Chinese [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5133.6s)]
*  company have this kind of access and influence with TikTok specifically? And what do you think [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5137.84s)]
*  the remedy should be for that? And then we'll get big picture and only get sacks involved in this as [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5142.72s)]
*  well. Should it be banned? Should they have this kind of access to Americans and influence? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5146.400000000001s)]
*  Should it be banned? No, because I believe in a free market. Will it be banned? Yes, because it's [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5152.400000000001s)]
*  the most obvious cultural way to pick a fight with China without actually picking a fight with China. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5164.0s)]
*  So yeah, I think it's going to be the most obvious victim of all of this. And so I don't know, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5173.76s)]
*  my advice to my friends who are shareholders, not just Brad, but others, is sell. Sell it. Move on. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5179.4400000000005s)]
*  It's in the Warren Buffett, what Warren Buffett calls the too hard bucket. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5187.120000000001s)]
*  Sacks, do you think that this is a national security issue? Do you personally believe TikTok [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5190.72s)]
*  should be banned? Or do you like me believe that we should just do a reciprocation test [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5197.6s)]
*  in order for TikTok to be allowed here in the United States, then Twitter, Facebook, Meta, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5204.320000000001s)]
*  Instagram, LinkedIn, etc. need to be allowed in China and you have this many days to reciprocate [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5209.2s)]
*  or else it's banned. I think Chamath is right that TikTok is going to be GPC roadkill [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5215.84s)]
*  and GPC stands for great power competition. You're going to start hearing that term more and more. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5220.48s)]
*  It's going to become the organizing principle of American foreign policy. And I just think that [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5225.12s)]
*  TikTok is all caught up in that. And personally, I'd like to understand what it is exactly that [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5229.919999999999s)]
*  they're doing with TikTok and so if there's having these vague accusations, I'd actually really like [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5235.759999999999s)]
*  to understand the underlying surveillance that it might be doing. I'd like to know a lot more about [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5239.5199999999995s)]
*  that. But in any event, I just think you're going to get caught up in this, again, GPC. That's going [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5246.72s)]
*  to be the dominant organizing principle of our foreign policy. I think that people are coming [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5251.52s)]
*  around to realizing that it's China, not Russia. That is the central global competitor and adversary [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5258.240000000001s)]
*  of the United States. It's the only country in the world that's a potential peer competitor to the [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5265.4400000000005s)]
*  US. Its economy is roughly the same size as the US. It's got four times the population. It's the [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5269.84s)]
*  one that we really need to watch out for. I think there's growing realization in Washington [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5275.12s)]
*  that the Ukraine war is a little bit of a misdirect and that we need to basically get back to doing [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5281.5199999999995s)]
*  what we were doing before the war, which is pivoting to Asia. And by the way, thinking about that just [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5288.72s)]
*  for a second, I think David, you're totally right because the game theory now to me makes a lot more [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5293.92s)]
*  sense in the framing of GPC. So for example, if you think about what the CHIPS Act does, right? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5300.88s)]
*  The CHIPS Act basically says we are going to nearshore or onshore every capability we need [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5307.92s)]
*  so that we can make and manufacture all the critical semiconductors for all of our interests, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5317.04s)]
*  technological, business, military, etc. But what is that really? What that is, is an option to not [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5322.72s)]
*  have to defend Taiwan. And why is that important? It's because today if Taiwan were invaded by China, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5330.16s)]
*  we get pulled into a conflagration that we don't know how it ends. We don't know what the beginning, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5336.4s)]
*  middle, or end of it looks like. It's extremely dangerous and precarious. So spend a couple [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5340.88s)]
*  trillion dollars, create financial incentives, build a bridge to Korea and to Japan so that they [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5346.24s)]
*  bring onshore and into Mexico all the capabilities we need with Western Europe who are already our [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5352.32s)]
*  allies already, along with Japan and Korea. And now all of a sudden we have complete optionality [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5358.48s)]
*  and now we can deal with the greater Chinese hegemony in a much more balanced way. So I think the [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5364.0s)]
*  GPC framing is shared, by the way, between the Democrats and the Republicans. So this is why [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5370.639999999999s)]
*  it's so much bigger than one single company. That's why I think TikTok's roadkill. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5377.759999999999s)]
*  Brad, if we frame it as a competition, we're not framing it as a war. We're in competition [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5382.16s)]
*  and part of that is going to be this decoupling. Is this decoupling helpful to America? Is it [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5387.04s)]
*  helpful to humanity? Is it better that we decouple a bit? This interdependency maybe got a little too [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5393.44s)]
*  deep as we saw during COVID with supply chains? Well, I mean, in a great power struggle, it is [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5399.5199999999995s)]
*  what the words imply, right? So I don't, you know, part of the reason you want to have [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5405.5199999999995s)]
*  trade with China and part of the reason we don't want to have a hard decoupling is, you know, [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5411.36s)]
*  a longstanding theory that company countries that trade together are less likely to go to war. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5417.44s)]
*  So, you know, I think if you listen to what's coming out of this, you know, these select committee [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5422.719999999999s)]
*  this week that held its first hearing is on the on the extremes, you hear people saying hard [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5429.84s)]
*  decoupling, right? And in the middle, you have people saying, listen, we need to define a [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5435.36s)]
*  circumference around national security, and we need to decouple as to all things that are within [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5440.4s)]
*  that circumference. Now, I will tell you that the debate is about how large is that circle. So it [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5446.879999999999s)]
*  starts off as, for example, sophisticated computer chips out of Nvidia. So China, you know, can't [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5452.0s)]
*  compete with us in the AI arms race, but it's quickly emerged into, you know, batteries, energy, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5458.48s)]
*  food, supply chains, it the circumference has now become almost as large as the economy itself. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5465.2s)]
*  I would argue that it's not just the chips act. It's also IRA, which is another trillion dollars [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5472.48s)]
*  of funding for basically onshore and supply chains, vital materials to build batteries, etc. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5478.16s)]
*  You know, so I think it's a very reasonable policy by both parties to pursue. It's clear that we're [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5488.4s)]
*  going to have some decoupling. I think it's a it's a it's going to lead to an interesting question [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5494.24s)]
*  on the part of China, you know, she was out last week saying, you know, I'm going to make a speech [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5501.28s)]
*  about peace with Russia. You know, this is more David's territory. But my hunch is that there may [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5506.5599999999995s)]
*  be, you know, if China, China thinks there's going to be a hard decoupling from an economic perspective, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5513.84s)]
*  this is bad for global economic growth. This is bad for Chinese growth. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5519.76s)]
*  I don't think it's bad for growth. I think it's bad for inflation. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5523.68s)]
*  Explain. Well, because I think that we'll have many versions of everything everywhere. So we will more [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5527.44s)]
*  redundancy. Yeah, more redundancy. We're going to rely on Central and South America in a meaningfully [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5533.599999999999s)]
*  bigger way. And what that'll mean is that there'll be more jobs and economic prosperity for those [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5540.0s)]
*  countries. They'll feed the United States, China will feed it less. And as a result, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5544.56s)]
*  there'll be more inflation because you won't have the cost advantages. By the way, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5549.4400000000005s)]
*  China is not just going to sit there and take this line down. They've already [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5552.72s)]
*  punched back a few times. So for example, in the middle of the summer, China introduced [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5556.88s)]
*  a tariff and slowing the export of certain materials and technology to make solar wafers. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5561.84s)]
*  Now, why is that critical? Well, again, talked about this before, but we are going to take the [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5567.280000000001s)]
*  marginal cost of energy to zero in this country. And the levelized cost of energy, particularly [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5572.8s)]
*  via solar, is the cheapest it's ever been. And so what China sees is, oh my gosh, if the United [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5577.92s)]
*  States has abundant free energy, now a huge component of what drives costs is gone. So now [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5584.56s)]
*  the United States could partner with El Salvador, Mexico, Honduras, Argentina, Brazil. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5593.2s)]
*  Vietnam is happening here too. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5599.2s)]
*  No, but I'm just saying it's close by. And if you can deliver zero cost energy to those places, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5600.72s)]
*  now the manufacturing capability could exist there. My point is, it's such a complicated [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5606.5599999999995s)]
*  chess piece. So China's not taking any of this line down. But I think that what David's framing [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5610.8s)]
*  is totally accurate. This is the beginning of a GPC and it's an economic tit for tat that we're [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5615.68s)]
*  going to play out. We tax chips, they tax solar panels, we go after TikTok just as a [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5621.52s)]
*  confusion maker, right? [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5628.64s)]
*  Yeah. There's going to be a lot of followings back and forth here. I can tell you there's a [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5630.96s)]
*  very easy test for if China sees TikTok as a strategic asset. And it's going to create [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5636.080000000001s)]
*  more shareholder value, Brad, if they were to spin it out and make it a publicly traded American [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5644.400000000001s)]
*  company with American shareholders, it would create more shareholder value for a bike dance. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5648.88s)]
*  Therefore, if they don't spin it out, that means they're not acting in the interest of shareholders [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5652.72s)]
*  and shareholder value. They're acting in the interest of their national security. Pretty clear [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5657.28s)]
*  reciprocation and collaboration would be a much better model, I think, for working with the Chinese. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5662.56s)]
*  And hopefully we can find some things that we can collaborate on. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5669.12s)]
*  Brad raised the Chinese peace proposal in Ukraine, which I think is an interesting topic. Can we [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5672.8s)]
*  you guys want to go there for a minute? Sure. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5679.12s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Can I take a shot at explaining what the Chinese were doing? I think it was a [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5682.32s)]
*  clever diplomatic maneuver by the Chinese to try and grab the moral high ground here. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5685.76s)]
*  They're basically saying, listen, we're interested in peace. We're going to put forward a proposal. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5690.0s)]
*  The Americans fell into the trap of basically dismissing it right away, throwing cold water [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5693.84s)]
*  on it. The US State Department has done this twice before. Remember, back in March of last year, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5697.92s)]
*  Naftali Bennett from Israel tried to negotiate a peace deal. And he himself said that it was the [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5702.4s)]
*  West, the Americans who rejected it. He thought it had a 50-50 chance of succeeding. You then had [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5708.719999999999s)]
*  the peace process in Istanbul, Turkey, with Erdogan presiding over it. You had the Istanbul [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5713.679999999999s)]
*  communique, which again, they were very close to having a peace deal and Blinken and the US threw [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5719.92s)]
*  cold water on it. So what's happening here is that the US is not playing its traditional role [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5725.04s)]
*  as peacemaker where we try to go in and mediate these conflicts. We're doing the opposite of that. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5731.2s)]
*  We're throwing cold water on the peace process. Now, why are we not acting as the mediator? I'll [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5736.72s)]
*  tell you why. Because we are a co-belligerent. This is an American proxy war that we're fighting [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5740.72s)]
*  against Russia. So we have no interest in mediating a peace process. And moreover, [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5745.44s)]
*  we're not trusted to mediate a peace process because we're one of the effectively one of the [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5749.2s)]
*  combatants. So it's a PR strategy by Xi Jinping to take the global moral high ground. I agree with [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5754.24s)]
*  that. I said it on Twitter a couple of weeks ago like this. This is amazing that he's starting [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5759.92s)]
*  the peace process. We want regime change. We want to plead and we want to ankle Putin. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5764.0s)]
*  They want to keep him in the game. The more death spots there are, the worse, the better it is for [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5769.04s)]
*  them. They would like to keep the Legion of Doom going. They don't want to see regime change and [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5773.52s)]
*  democracy in Russia eventually. I don't think that's how they view it. But listen, J. Cal, [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5778.16s)]
*  J. Cal's very close to getting it. But here's where I would disagree with you a little bit. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5782.4800000000005s)]
*  Getting what? [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5786.16s)]
*  Let me explain. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5787.76s)]
*  Okay, go ahead. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5789.2s)]
*  So from the Chinese point of view, the war in Ukraine is like manna from heaven. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5790.5599999999995s)]
*  They love this war. Number one, because it's interfering with the US's pivot to Asia. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5797.12s)]
*  We were basically in the process of redeploying all of our force, all of our military to containing [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5804.4s)]
*  them in East Asia. And now we're bogged down in Europe. Okay, so that's number one. Number two, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5809.84s)]
*  we are massively depleting our stockpiles of weapons. We've used something like [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5816.0s)]
*  nine years of stingers and five years of javelins. And we're running out of ammunition. I can't [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5821.360000000001s)]
*  believe it, but we're running out of artillery. The Russians actually have a six to one artillery [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5825.92s)]
*  advantage, which is why they're actually doing much better in this war than people are acknowledging. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5830.0s)]
*  We should come back to that. The last thing is that the Chinese now are benefiting [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5834.16s)]
*  from the economic sanctions on Russia because Russia is now selling them oil and gas and all [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5839.12s)]
*  of their minerals at a big discount. So this has been a wonderful thing from the Chinese standpoint. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5845.04s)]
*  So this is the problem with us thinking in this Marvel movie way of the world in which we're [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5851.44s)]
*  the super friends and we're against the legion of doom, okay, is because there is no natural [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5857.2s)]
*  alliance in the real world between China, Russia and Iran. These are three very different regimes [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5862.32s)]
*  with different types of governments who naturally would not get along. They would be adversaries. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5868.88s)]
*  Naturally, they'd be suspicious of each other as China and Russia were during the cold war, [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5875.2s)]
*  but we have pushed them closer together. This is the problem with having this overly moralistic view [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5880.4800000000005s)]
*  of foreign policy. Over to you, Jason. What do you think? Is there a question? Is there a question? [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5886.08s)]
*  What's the question? Yeah. I mean, you frame it as the legion of doom, so just explain. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5891.92s)]
*  Well, it's the axis of evil. The 50% of- Let me tell you. Hold on, hold on. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5896.96s)]
*  Listen, Lex Luthor and Braniac would not be working together if it weren't for us declaring [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5902.56s)]
*  a war on both of them at the same time. Absolutely, actually. Pakistan, [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5907.68s)]
*  Iran and China work together on nuclear technology. So they do, when it's convenient for them, [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5912.48s)]
*  work on things like nuclear bombs. So there is an affiliation, but you're correct. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5919.12s)]
*  They're the 50% of the planet of humans on this planet who live under authoritarians. And so they [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5925.360000000001s)]
*  they're authoritarians. They're always going to think in their own interest. They're always [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5932.160000000001s)]
*  going to think in their own interest above their own peoples, let alone the people of another [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5934.96s)]
*  country. They don't care. They don't care about human rights. They don't care about the rights [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5939.52s)]
*  of humans. And they certainly don't care about the rights of humans in another country. And the West [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5942.88s)]
*  is on a noble mission to spread democracy in the world. And that is a noble thing worth fighting [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5947.280000000001s)]
*  for and is worth defending free countries from despots. I know that you are a fan of these folks, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5952.72s)]
*  Sax apparently, and you think they should be able to run amok. I will take the other side of it. I [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5959.52s)]
*  think the West should act in unison. The only criticism I have is that we're not acting in [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5963.68s)]
*  unison. I would like to see the West sending Biden to Ukraine. Hold on. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5968.320000000001s)]
*  Talked enough. You just accused me of somehow being fans of these people. Where did I ever say [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5974.400000000001s)]
*  that I was a fan of Xi and China or Putin or the Ayatollahs in Iran? Hold on. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5978.96s)]
*  You said we provoked Putin. Putin invaded another country. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5984.4s)]
*  Hold on. You said we caused it. He chose to do it. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5987.52s)]
*  Hold on a second. I am arguing for a geopolitical strategy that benefits the United States. I'm on [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5991.6s)]
*  Team America. And your policy of driving these people into an axis of evil is foolish for the [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=5997.76s)]
*  reason I said, which is we are going to power up the Chinese economy so they are a much more [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6003.52s)]
*  formidable enemy to the United States. That is the last thing we need to do. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6008.64s)]
*  You've stated. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6012.0s)]
*  Now, with respect to... Hold on a second. Let me finish. You had a chance. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6012.240000000001s)]
*  With respect to Ukraine and Putin there, there's no question that Putin invaded. He is the [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6016.160000000001s)]
*  aggressor. However, the question you have to ask is why? And the fact of the matter is that, [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6022.72s)]
*  first of all, we fomented a coup in Ukraine in 2014. This is your democracy spreading that you [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6028.4800000000005s)]
*  like. All of a sudden we got these NGOs and we got Victoria Newland from the State Department [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6034.88s)]
*  in there basically fomenting these coups. It doesn't work out quite the way you think, J. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6039.4400000000005s)]
*  Cal. That's problem number one. Then we try to run NATO right up to Russia's border. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6043.52s)]
*  And you expect them just to accept that because we're a benevolent superpower. That's not the way [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6049.6s)]
*  the real world works. Putin was tremendously threatened by that. And it wasn't just him. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6053.6s)]
*  It was all Russian elites. Read the Bill Byrds memo from 2008. He explains that even [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6057.84s)]
*  the liberal elements within Russia were tremendously threatened by NATO expansion. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6064.16s)]
*  That is what basically poisoned diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6069.04s)]
*  And it was a major cause of this war. Now, listen, just because you don't think it's provocative, [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6073.92s)]
*  doesn't mean that the Russians don't think it's provocative. You have to be able to put yourself [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6080.639999999999s)]
*  in the other guy's shoes for just one second. And the fact of the matter is there were diplomatic [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6084.5599999999995s)]
*  steps that we could have taken to defuse this crisis in this war and we didn't do it. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6089.2s)]
*  And now look what's happened. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and Ukraine's been [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6093.84s)]
*  destroyed. It's been absolutely destroyed. And let me tell you right now, it looks like they're [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6097.4400000000005s)]
*  losing this war. So I don't see where your superhero policy has gotten us except to make [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6100.96s)]
*  China richer and more powerful and to destroy Ukraine. That is where your naive idealism has [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6106.72s)]
*  gotten us. Yeah. And I would say if you, if left to your devices and you're not engaging and not [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6112.88s)]
*  presenting a united front against Putin, he will invade country after country. The West must fight [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6120.56s)]
*  for democracy. We must fight for human rights, even if it's uncomfortable. And you seem to think [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6125.52s)]
*  we provoked him to invade this country. He's a murdering dictator, authoritarian who has been [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6130.88s)]
*  murdering his own people and other people for his entire career. And he will continue to do so. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6136.080000000001s)]
*  Let me clarify, because you're putting words in my mouth. Okay. When you say that I think that we [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6142.88s)]
*  provoked him. What I believe is that we took actions that in Russian eyes were provocative. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6147.12s)]
*  Yeah. You said we provoked it. I'm saying that from their subjective point of view, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6153.44s)]
*  they saw these actions as provocative. They said so. Listen, the Russian elite- [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6157.599999999999s)]
*  Which is what I said back to you. We provoked it is your position. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6161.92s)]
*  No. I just explained it. That's not the words I would use. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6164.72s)]
*  Hold on. His position is that in their eyes, they were provoked, Jason. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6167.2s)]
*  We are the provokers. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6171.5199999999995s)]
*  They're talking about and no. What you're doing right now is like dishonest. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6172.72s)]
*  I just explained the language that I would use. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6179.68s)]
*  Yes. Yes. We provoked them. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6181.84s)]
*  We took actions that in Russian eyes were provocative. There's a difference. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6184.400000000001s)]
*  Yes. Provocative, provoked. Yes. The act of provoking them. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6187.76s)]
*  Just stop lying. Okay. It's going to be too much. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6191.04s)]
*  Okay. Let's move on. We're never going to agree on this, Sax. Okay. And by the way, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6193.04s)]
*  I'd like to remind the audience that nobody on this podcast is an expert on foreign policy. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6198.16s)]
*  Sax is not Henry Kissinger. I'm not Obama. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6202.48s)]
*  On last week's show, you had come around to my point of view. You said this war was a mistake. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6205.44s)]
*  On the very last show, you said it was a disaster. And now you're backsliding right back to your [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6212.32s)]
*  Legion of Doom. No. I believe the West should present a united front and we should hold the [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6219.36s)]
*  line with Russia invading other countries. That's my belief. I do not think we should be [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6225.5199999999995s)]
*  doing this solo. I think we should not be sending Biden. We should be sending [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6229.68s)]
*  15 leaders of countries to Ukraine. We should be sending people in and we should be doing [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6234.400000000001s)]
*  a peace process. And I think the military industrial complex, largely driven by the GOP, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6239.04s)]
*  is what's at fault here. They want to use these weapons. They want to replenish the supply [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6244.56s)]
*  and they want to regime change. I don't think we should be going for regime change. I think [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6249.4400000000005s)]
*  we should be building bridges. So my point is a little more subtle. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6252.16s)]
*  You're doing it right there. You're basically engaging in this ridiculous rhetoric that we've [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6256.24s)]
*  seen in the media, which is that if you simply want a more realistic American strategy, because [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6260.24s)]
*  you believe it benefits America, that you're automatically accused of not being a Putin [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6265.5199999999995s)]
*  sympathizer. You're doing what the mainstream media has done. No, I'm not. I just said to you, [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6269.92s)]
*  it should be the entire West as a group, as a block negotiating with Putin. What do you think? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6274.639999999999s)]
*  And I think it's fine for Xi Jinping to be part of that. I welcome Xi Jinping, Germany, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6280.32s)]
*  and the United States, and France, and the UK, all getting together and trying to get these two [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6285.52s)]
*  parties to settle. What do you think we're doing? What do you think we're doing right or wrong with [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6289.4400000000005s)]
*  China right now? Right or wrong with China? What do you think we're doing right and wrong? Or right, [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6293.360000000001s)]

*  isolating them. I think we should be looking for areas we can collaborate on the environment, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6305.360000000001s)]
*  tech technology. You agree with the chips act, you agree with basically on shoring and you're [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6310.56s)]
*  showing all the critical infrastructure we need is I think we should not be dependent on any [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6315.92s)]
*  foreign we should we should have energy security. We should have [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6321.12s)]
*  medical technology. Of course, yes. But I think every country should I think China should have [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6324.96s)]
*  that we should have it every country should aspire to be resilient and not be dependent on [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6329.6s)]
*  another country and being dependent on a dictator like Germany was on Putin, or we were with China [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6334.64s)]
*  for medicines or for, you know, medical equipment or chips. We do not want to be in that position [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6340.320000000001s)]
*  ever. One question just on Ukraine just for a second, Jake out, would you be willing, [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6345.76s)]
*  in order to achieve a peace deal for Ukraine, would you be willing to agree to two things? Number one, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6349.68s)]
*  that Ukraine would be a neutral country instead of part of NATO. And number two, that we would [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6355.68s)]
*  recognize Crimea being part of Russia, would you be willing to give those two things? [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6360.16s)]
*  I think that's up not up to me. I think it's up to the people of Ukraine and Russia to sort this [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6364.639999999999s)]
*  out. And it's up for the West to set the table for them to do it. And part of setting the table for [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6369.599999999999s)]
*  them to do it is to make it more painful for them to stay at this war. So if they are told if you [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6374.0s)]
*  keep fighting over these things, and you don't come to a resolution between those two parties, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6379.5199999999995s)]
*  who have to live with that resolution, that is the uncomfortable thing that will force them. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6383.2s)]
*  And I'm gonna be China, us and India all working together, all of us working together to force [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6387.84s)]
*  those two parties into a solution that works for them. We have Brad for 10 minutes, I want to move [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6392.8s)]
*  on. I want to show you guys a tweet about Harvard students. And I want you guys to react to Draymond's [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6396.4800000000005s)]
*  comments, because they're just fucking incredible. I don't know if you guys saw this, [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6401.84s)]
*  but isn't that unbelievable? It says there was a study at Harvard that found that 43% [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6404.8s)]
*  of white students there are legacy athletes or related to donors or staff. That's unbelievable. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6410.88s)]
*  Is that public knowledge? Or is that like kind of leaked information? I wonder. This is from Dolores [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6421.4400000000005s)]
*  Handy. I don't know who that is. Maybe we could click on who the source of that is. Legacy's got [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6426.0s)]
*  to go, right? That concept, should that just go away? Yeah, is there a valid reason to have legacy? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6431.36s)]
*  Is there a valid reason to have legacy? It feels unfair. It feels un-American that these [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6440.24s)]
*  important institutions give preference to people who are stupider and achieve less if this is an [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6446.5599999999995s)]
*  achievement-based system. It just feels unfair. Yeah, I mean, well, we know that the first class [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6451.28s)]
*  had 0%. And so we know what the trend line looks like. So at some point, we're approaching 100%. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6458.4s)]
*  Just an open question, right? One of the things I would like to see, Chamath, is what's the [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6464.96s)]
*  relative performance 10 years after graduation between the legacies and the kids who had to [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6469.2s)]
*  fucking scratch and fight to get into the place? Oh my God, yeah. I mean, I think we know the answer. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6474.96s)]
*  Well, you would think they would be higher performers, the latter group, but you would [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6482.48s)]
*  also think that if legacy got you into Harvard, then the legacy and your group is going to get [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6485.599999999999s)]
*  you into other things, right? You'll have the end in other places. They're the ones who are [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6491.52s)]
*  miserable and walking around rich and haven't achieved anything. Yeah. Listen, Sax didn't get [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6495.6s)]
*  into Stanford based on his dad's buying a building, right? Well, that's for sure. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6503.360000000001s)]
*  Okay, so here is a video from Dream Hungry. What I do want to go back to is Black History Month. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6510.080000000001s)]
*  This is actually the first time you've seen me in a Black History Month shirt, [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6518.4s)]
*  all Black History Month, and it's very intentional. I really just threw this shirt on [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6522.639999999999s)]
*  because I didn't have another shirt to throw on. But Black History Month, at some point, [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6527.5199999999995s)]
*  can we get rid of it? At some point? Why we got to keep getting the shortest month to celebrate our [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6531.92s)]
*  history? You got governors who want to take our history out of schools, and I'm not going to be [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6543.92s)]
*  the fool to go say, yeah, we get celebrated for 28 days. So at some point, I'd like to get rid of it. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6550.56s)]
*  It's, you know, we're making all these changes in the world. Can't talk about these people, [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6557.28s)]
*  can't talk about those people, can't say this, can't say that. At some point, it's time to get [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6562.8s)]
*  rid of Black History Month. I get rid of Black History, like they're trying to do. But Black [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6567.44s)]
*  History Month? No. Teach my history from January 1st to December 31st, and then do it again, [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6574.08s)]
*  and then again, and then again, and then again. That's what I like to see. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6582.16s)]
*  Wow. Strong. So good. Love that. Love that guy. He's the best. He's the fucking best. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6586.799999999999s)]
*  That was strong. He's the best. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6593.44s)]
*  You need to clip the last 10 seconds of that. We all need to tweet that. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6594.96s)]
*  Yeah, be relentless. Chamath, there was a correction we needed to make about the [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6600.32s)]
*  Stripe chart last week. Go ahead. Yeah, so- [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6604.639999999999s)]
*  You have the floor. We talked about some Stripe stuff last week, and my analyst came to me after [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6606.719999999999s)]
*  the show was published, and there was a couple of miscalculations in the spreadsheet that generated [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6612.24s)]
*  the graphic, which big up to him for calling it out very quickly. Anyways, I just wanted to show [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6616.16s)]
*  you the updated one, just so that we could make sure we get that on the record. I guess this would [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6620.08s)]
*  be a purple color. Is that purple? Yeah. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6624.0s)]
*  That's actually when you calculate net revenue, and I think what [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6625.92s)]
*  did was calculated gross revenue, which is in the red. So we showed this, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6629.84s)]
*  but it actually should be purple. So that's the updated, accurate version of the analysis. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6634.16s)]
*  So there you have it, folks. What does that mean for Stripe versus [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6640.16s)]
*  Adyen in terms of just, which is a better business, just to summarize it? [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6643.68s)]
*  To be honest with you, it says what we said before, which is that the previous valuation was very [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6648.96s)]
*  expectation heavy, and the new valuation is definitely more in line, but still very rich [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6655.84s)]
*  relative to other companies who have large profitability and large growth rates. And I think [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6662.08s)]
*  that's the key takeaway, which is it's very hard to both have huge margins and grow at [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6669.52s)]
*  mediumly high double digit rates. And the few that can visa mastercard and Adyen [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6676.4800000000005s)]
*  tend to trade at a very different valuation set than everything else. And so I think that's [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6682.4800000000005s)]
*  the challenge for Stripe. If they can do it, they'll be in that class. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6688.240000000001s)]
*  Okay. For the Sultan of science doing his SPAC in New York, having an incredible dinner [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6690.96s)]
*  at Carbone right now. Can I say, can I say- [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6697.4400000000005s)]

*  and save the episode. My Insta reply, Gerstner's on fire. We're all set. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6710.24s)]
*  He has to go find a safe place. He's irreplaceable. He's irreplaceable. [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6722.48s)]

*  Oh my God. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6737.12s)]
*  It wasn't a bad episode until J. Cal started [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6738.0s)]
*  again. The Legion of Doom, are you kidding me? [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6741.360000000001s)]
*  Just like you strike January 6th. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6744.400000000001s)]
*  You can't strike words in English. You can't strike a single word. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6745.84s)]
*  You struck my single word last week when I called you out as a Trump voter. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6749.360000000001s)]

*  Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. Who did you vote for in 2016, 2020? Be honest. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6757.12s)]

*  Oh God. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6762.88s)]

*  Legion of Doom. They're the Legion of Doom. You're pro-Putin. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6765.04s)]
*  You know, there's actually a meme. There's a meme on Twitter that anyone who disagrees with me is [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6770.64s)]
*  Russian disinformation or pro-Putin. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6775.28s)]

*  That's basically you. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6779.2s)]

*  During this entire year of Ukraine, I say every time, to be clear, you're not saying Putin is [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOuks3BM55o&t=6784.64s)]
