# E147 TED goes woke, Canada's Nazi blunder, AI adds vision, plus who owns OpenAI?
**All In Podcast:** [September 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ)
*  Hey Coleman, how's it going? Hey Coleman, welcome to the show. Hey, how's it going? Have you ever heard of the show? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=0.0s)]

*  Great to meet you apparently like many women. She has like uh, she has a legit concerning obsession with sax [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=12.0s)]
*  Uh, but also don't say it. Oh my god [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Those sax fans are crazy end the episode end the episode. Oh my god [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=23.92s)]
*  Where to go call me right in here [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=30.56s)]
*  All right, here we go. Let me let me this this is your cold open phone. I'm sorry [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=33.6s)]
*  I I need to psychologically explore this before we get into the real substance of it [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=37.28s)]
*  Why does she like him so much? I don't understand this by the way [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=41.04s)]
*  I think you guys missed the second half of my statement. I said sax and chamomil [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=43.76s)]
*  Oh shit. Okay, great [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=47.68s)]
*  Thank god, okay, here we go. Thank god three two [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=51.6s)]
*  Rain man david sacks [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=60.08s)]
*  All right, everybody welcome back to the all in podcast [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=72.88s)]
*  We have a very full docket today. I thought we'd start with something [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=77.36s)]
*  Pretty crazy. There was a really weird moment last week ted through one of its speakers under the bus [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=81.28s)]
*  So we decided to have him on to talk about the experience the second time they've done it at least [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=86.48s)]
*  They did to sarah soberman for doing comedy at ted [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=91.2s)]
*  Because people at ted are a bunch of virtual signaling lunatics including some of my friends who go [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=94.56s)]
*  But colman hughes, if you don't know him is a writer and podcaster [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=100.72s)]
*  He has a a pretty popular podcast called conversations with colman and he did a talk which I encourage everybody [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=105.36s)]
*  to watch [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=111.76s)]
*  At ted and it's titled a case for color blindness. We all watched it. It's very powerful talk and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=113.52s)]
*  Something weird happened [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=122.16s)]
*  Coleman welcome to the program and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=124.96s)]
*  Maybe you could just share with the audience [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=128.16s)]
*  How you wound up speaking at ted? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=131.28s)]
*  What the content of your talk was briefly? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=134.0s)]
*  And then the bizarre reaction when they tried to ban and kill your talk post you giving it [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=138.24s)]
*  Yeah, so first really glad to be on guys. I'm a fan of the pod [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=145.36s)]
*  So i'll give the short version here if you want the long version you can go to the free press where I wrote a big [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=148.08s)]
*  Summary of what happened there. Basically what happened is chris anderson invited me to give a ted talk [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=154.0s)]
*  And uh, I chose the subject of my upcoming book which is coming out in february [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=160.24s)]
*  Called the end of race politics and the argument is just [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=165.78s)]
*  Essentially color blindness. This is the idea that you want to treat people without regard to race both in your personal lives [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=169.86s)]
*  And in our public policy and wherever we have policies that are meant to collect and help the most disadvantaged [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=176.1s)]
*  We we should preferentially use class as a variable rather than race. That's that's my talk in a nutshell [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=183.3s)]
*  So I prepared the talk with the ted team I got their feedback edited curated, etc. Got up there in april gave the talk [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=190.74s)]
*  95 of the people in the audience. It was quite well received whether or not they agreed with every point it was [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=199.2s)]
*  They well within the bounds of acceptable discourse [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=206.02s)]
*  There was a very small minority on stage. I could see that was [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=209.3s)]
*  Physically upset by my talk on stage [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=213.36s)]
*  I could see this on stage yet in the moment, but I mean i'm talking five people in a crowd of almost 2 000 [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=217.06s)]
*  So I expected that because you know color blindness is not in vogue today on on the left [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=223.78s)]
*  Amongst progressives. It's really the idea non-grada and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=230.9s)]
*  So I was expecting to field some pushback and I I talked to some critics and so forth [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=235.46s)]
*  But what happened is what began as just a few people upset? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  Began to spiral into a kind of internal staff meltdown at ted [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=246.58s)]
*  So this group called black at ted asked to speak with me. I agreed and then they [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  Said actually we don't want to talk to you and they're an employee group at ted [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  After the conference [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=262.1s)]
*  Chris emailed me and said look i'm getting i'm getting a lot of blowback here internally [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=263.62s)]
*  There are people saying we shouldn't release your talk at all [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=268.02s)]
*  And then over the course of the next month [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=271.22s)]
*  They came up with a variety of sort of creative solutions about how to release my talk in a way that would appease [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=273.78000000000003s)]
*  The woke staffers that really didn't want it to be released at all [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=280.5s)]
*  And at this point I had to start kind of sticking up for myself. So first they wanted to [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=284.02000000000004s)]
*  Attach uh, like a debate to the end of my talk and release it as one video [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=288.5s)]
*  Which I felt would really send the wrong message [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=293.70000000000005s)]
*  It would send the message that like this idea can't be heard without the opposing perspective. Did they tell you what was? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=295.62s)]
*  Problematic about your talk [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  To you know in work term. Well, like what was the problem with the talk? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=304.1s)]
*  Well, there are no factual problems. It passed the fact checking team. There were there were no substantive issues with the talk [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=308.26000000000005s)]
*  The problem was that you had the wrong opinion the staff it upset the staff [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=314.82000000000005s)]
*  That was the language that was used it upset certain people in the staff god and and those people are black [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=318.5s)]
*  um, probably most were uh, you know, I I tried to actually have face-to-face conversations with [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=324.58000000000004s)]
*  Some of these folks. I only got to to uh talk to one woman [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=331.38000000000005s)]
*  So presumably many of them were black, but possibly not all [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=335.70000000000005s)]
*  Okay [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=340.02000000000004s)]
*  What was the what do you perceive was the problem with your talk or what they perceived the problem with your talk is? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=340.5s)]
*  So the the last day of the ted conference they have a town hall people from the audience come and give feedback [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=346.98s)]
*  The town hall opened with two people denouncing my talk back to back [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=353.78000000000003s)]
*  The first said that it was racist and dangerous and irresponsible [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=357.94s)]
*  And the second guy who's actually a guy I knew [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=362.74s)]
*  He said that I was willing to have a slide back into the days of separate but equal [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=366.34s)]
*  Which was totally the opposite of my talk and I I implore anyone to just go online and watch it go on youtube [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=371.38s)]
*  Decide for yourself whether these criticisms bear any resemblance to to reality [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=378.58s)]
*  But that was the idea that the talk is racist that you know, i'm i'm some kind of pro jim crow person is really [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=383.94s)]
*  really deranged [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=391.38s)]
*  Kind of criticisms your talk is up on ted's website and on youtube, right? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=392.98s)]
*  But part of the controversy [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=398.26s)]
*  Was that the number of views? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=400.58000000000004s)]
*  Seem to be pretty suppressed [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=402.82s)]
*  Was that discussed with chris when you talk with him or do you have a point of view? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=405.38s)]
*  On the suppression of the promotion of the video even though they put it out there [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=409.38s)]
*  And how that's affected, you know how widespread the video has been made available to folks [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=413.38s)]
*  yeah, so [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=418.66s)]
*  In my final call with chris, he sort of presented this idea about how to release it [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=420.18s)]
*  And he sold it to me as a way to amplify my talk, which I think was kind of some spin [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=424.18s)]
*  He was in a tough position caught between me and his employees. We ultimately decided they would release the talk [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=429.62s)]
*  And then two weeks later, they'd release a debate between myself and this guy jamel buoy who was a new york times [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=435.14s)]
*  columnist [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=441.2s)]
*  Um, so the talk came out [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=442.66s)]
*  On ted website the debate came out and I kind of mentally [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=444.98s)]
*  Uh had forgotten about the whole situation until tim urban who was a popular blogger who's actually given the yeah [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=448.82000000000005s)]
*  He spoke at all in summit last year. Oh, that's great. Yeah, tim is great [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=455.86s)]
*  He he's also given the most viewed ted talk of all time on youtube [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=459.22s)]
*  Tim noticed that my talk just had a really absurdly low view count like an implausibly low view count on on ted's website [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=463.86s)]
*  In mid august he tweeted this [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=471.53999999999996s)]
*  And that he believed they were intentionally under promoting my talk. They said i checked. Yeah. Yeah [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=473.62s)]
*  I checked and [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=479.62s)]
*  All of the of the five talks surrounding mine. They all had between [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=481.14s)]
*  You know 450 000 views and 800 000 views. That was the full range mine had 73 000 [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=485.21999999999997s)]
*  Right, so 16 percent of the low end of the range of all the talks released around mine [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=492.18s)]
*  So when that happened I I felt that ted had kind of reneged on its end of our bargain and that's when um [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=498.74s)]
*  Barry weiss got wind of it and I went public just just to be clear [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=505.38s)]
*  You're saying that the condition for releasing your your ted talk [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=509.54s)]
*  The bargain you struck with chris [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=514.26s)]
*  Was that you would do a debate with someone in a separate video? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=516.66s)]
*  And that you had to do the debate in order to have your ted talk released [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=521.38s)]
*  Yes, wow, so yeah that that's what that was the end of the negotiation the beginning of the negotiation was trying to get me [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=524.98s)]
*  To release those things as one video and I said hell no [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=531.14s)]
*  And then next we're going to release them as separate videos on the same day [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=534.9s)]
*  I said hell no because that dilutes it and then we agreed on a two-week separation between the two [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=538.26s)]
*  In your experience with ted and your conversations around this matter [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=544.74s)]
*  Are you aware of other videos that ted? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=548.98s)]
*  Has refused to put out that were a live ted talk [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=551.86s)]
*  At the ted conference and they were deemed to be too controversial to be released publicly [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=555.14s)]
*  Definitely not this year [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=560.24s)]
*  I can't I I you know, I don't know the whole history of ted but nothing like that this year for sure [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=561.9399999999999s)]
*  We can go one of two ways with this friedberg [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=566.66s)]
*  Do you want to talk about the substance of the talk or maybe dig into the culture of ted? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=568.58s)]
*  I want to talk about the substance of the talk in a minute [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=573.78s)]
*  But I think it's worth just sharing my experience with you. I started going to ted as an attendee around [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=575.78s)]
*  I believe 2007 [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=581.14s)]
*  And I went every year until 2019. I got a lot from the community. I got a lot from the conference every year [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=582.8199999999999s)]
*  It was an incredible week of my life every year. It was a big deal for me [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=588.5s)]
*  Um in the early days I would go there and I saw new perspectives on technology on [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=592.5s)]
*  the environment on [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=599.62s)]
*  Social change on all these like topics that were not in my day-to-day that I thought were really exciting and awe inspiring [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=601.38s)]
*  And that really was kind of this ethos of ted back in the day before chris anderson took it over was to kind of [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=608.74s)]
*  You know inspire people with new ideas [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=613.22s)]
*  Over the years that I attended ted I began to observe that many of the talks and I spoke about this very briefly last [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=615.86s)]
*  Week as part of my motivation and interest in doing the all-in summit this year [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=621.22s)]
*  But that over time many of the talks began to take a bit of a social justice turn [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=624.9s)]
*  In the sense that there was almost a lecturing happening as curated [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=629.78s)]
*  by the editorial [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=634.4200000000001s)]
*  process at ted [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=635.84s)]
*  When donald trump was elected president [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=637.78s)]
*  in 2016 [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=640.5s)]
*  Needless to say most of the audience of ted [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=642.18s)]
*  Was not on that side of the voting block [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=644.74s)]
*  and what this [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=648.5799999999999s)]
*  Disturbed me the most was that in the three years after he was elected [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=650.5799999999999s)]
*  Every ted conference had plenty of subjects plenty of talks and plenty of conversations about why society is falling apart [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=655.06s)]
*  Why donald trump is a key root cause of that why so much of him and what he stands for and the people behind him [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=662.4200000000001s)]
*  Are unjust and evil in all these ways [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=668.82s)]
*  There wasn't a single talk that provided a perspective of why anyone voted for him [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=671.62s)]
*  There was no one that shared a point of view about why [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=676.4200000000001s)]
*  This person had come to gather more than half the votes or half the votes in the country [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=679.7s)]
*  And I thought that was such an important topic [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=684.74s)]
*  To better understand that I was so shocked that it was never part of the discourse at ted [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=687.22s)]
*  I'm not a republican. I'm not a conservative and i'm not against social justice issues [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=691.0600000000001s)]
*  But I saw ted over time get overtaken with this kind of very one-sided almost bullying type of approach [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=696.82s)]
*  To this is the narrative we want to sell society on rather than have a true discourse [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=704.58s)]
*  About the matter I sent in [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=709.7s)]
*  a survey [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=712.58s)]
*  Response in 2019 after I went to ted and I said i'm never coming back again this year did it for me [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=713.86s)]
*  I'm over it and there was such a lack of diversity of points of view at this conference [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=718.34s)]
*  And so much of this has veered away from inspiring topics and inspiring talks and it became all about fear of technology [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=723.7800000000001s)]
*  It became about social injustice caused by one side of the political spectrum [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=730.1s)]
*  And it really angered and upset me that everyone had become so close-minded at ted [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=734.6600000000001s)]
*  And I sent this note and chris anderson reached out to me and said well you have a conversation [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=739.0600000000001s)]
*  I went on a zoom call with him and I spoke with him for an hour and I shared all this and I said [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=742.6600000000001s)]
*  He's missing so much of what's happening. That's optimistic about the world. It's optimistic about technology [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=746.18s)]
*  That's different ways of looking at things and he's kind of created this very [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=751.3s)]
*  Narrow-minded view on the topics that they want to address and how they want to address them [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=755.4599999999999s)]
*  And that was it and I walked away [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=759.9399999999999s)]
*  So when I saw what happened with your talk to me [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=761.62s)]
*  It's almost like the ultimate end game of this process that i've been observing at ted personally for the last 13 years [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=764.66s)]
*  And I just wanted to you know last 15 years, I guess share that story with you [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=770.8199999999999s)]
*  And speak publicly about it. I I very much respect the intention of the people at ted. I respect chris anderson deeply [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=775.06s)]
*  The ted talks changed my life many times along the way over the decade plus that I went there [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=781.38s)]
*  There I have many great friends from ted. I know plenty plenty of people that have worked there. Everyone has the right intention [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=785.86s)]
*  but I think it's such a [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=790.8199999999999s)]
*  Microcosm and a reflection of what's broadly been going on [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=792.26s)]
*  Which is it's either my opinion or not and everyone coalesces around people with the same opinion [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=794.98s)]
*  And then you magnify it and you concentrate it and we have no discourse [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=799.38s)]
*  And ted used to be a place for discourse and it's lost that as have so many other forums for conversation [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=802.5s)]
*  In the society and country today colman. What's your what's your take on the on the ted organization? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=808.18s)]
*  You know pre and post having had this experience. I'm curious [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=814.18s)]
*  Yeah, what you just said david i've heard echoed from at least a dozen people that have gone to ted or or been [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=818.42s)]
*  Uh, you know in the ted community for 10 years or more they've noticed the exact change that you noticed [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=827.0600000000001s)]
*  The question is what has driven that is it actually coming top down from the leadership? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=833.38s)]
*  I'm not sure i'm skeptical. I yeah, I see you shaking your head. I agree chris anderson. I would say no [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=840.02s)]
*  I agree. So so like all my private communications with with chris suggests to me that [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=845.38s)]
*  He is just as alive to this problem of ideological capture of institutions as anyone [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=850.26s)]
*  But when it comes to you know, his own staff who have really strong feelings who are not pro free speech who are not pro [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=856.6600000000001s)]
*  um heterodox beliefs [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=865.6s)]
*  And open discourse who who literally just don't share that value [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=868.02s)]
*  You know, it's a very tricky thing with leadership [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=873.0600000000001s)]
*  Sometimes you have to simply be the bad guy and say i'm sorry. These are the values of the institution and if you're not on board [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=875.7800000000001s)]
*  Your this is not right for you. And my perception is that [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=882.5s)]
*  ted has been captured kind of from the bottom up like many institutions just from the [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=886.1s)]
*  seeping in of staff that don't share those values and the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=891.0600000000001s)]
*  In uh inability of the leadership to actually hold the line for those values. Did they tell you that you made them feel unsafe? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=894.1s)]
*  Yes, actually [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=901.1400000000001s)]
*  Actually, yes. Yes people said they felt they were attacked in the audience [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=902.34s)]
*  And i'm you know, my my talk was again just look it up on youtube. It's quite mild [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=906.58s)]
*  Can we actually talk about that? Yeah, let's go into the substance. What was your take on it? [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=911.5400000000001s)]
*  I'll just make a statement, which is I think that your talk was [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=915.7s)]
*  superb [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=919.44s)]
*  And just to give you my journey as a kid that grew up [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=921.62s)]
*  As a refugee on welfare [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=926.26s)]
*  And then to get through every single sort of strata of society [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=930.34s)]
*  I think when I look back the biggest thing that I struggled with was always confusing [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=934.74s)]
*  When I felt mistreated [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=941.46s)]
*  I would always direct it at racism. It would be my sort of safety blanket and I would always look at [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=943.86s)]
*  Other people as doing that and it was only until [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=951.94s)]
*  I met my wife [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=956.5s)]
*  And spending years and years talking about it where I was able to disarm this and see that out of a hundred interactions [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=958.26s)]
*  A lot of the time just people are having a bad day [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=964.58s)]
*  Some other percentage of the time people are actually just being very classist [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=967.46s)]
*  Because racism it turns out is like a pretty severe perversion and it's really [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=970.66s)]
*  crazy when you actually see it play out and [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=977.4599999999999s)]
*  For me had I had a framework if I had your talk when I was in my 20s and 30s [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=982.26s)]
*  I would have spirited myself a lot of self-sabotage [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=986.42s)]
*  Because what that does is when you feel these things and you don't have a framework to interpret it or to tolerate the anxiety [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=989.4599999999999s)]
*  I would internalize that anxiety and I was a less productive person [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=996.26s)]
*  and so if the goal was for me on behalf of my family or on behalf of [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1000.8199999999999s)]
*  people like me to make it [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1005.62s)]
*  I would have gotten there much faster had I not gotten in my own way and when I watched your talk [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1008.74s)]
*  It was incredibly validating for the work that I had done [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1015.14s)]
*  And I had thought to myself man if I had had him if he had made that for me when I was 20 years old [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1018.9s)]
*  Amazing I would have I could have done so much more because when I think about some of the mistakes I made they were rooted in this specific issue that you touched so I just want to say thank you [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1026.42s)]
*  And I also want to say that to the extent other people are interested and feel like that [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1035.3799999999999s)]
*  You should really listen to what you have to say because I thought it was eloquently [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1040.02s)]
*  Addressed I was a huge huge huge fan of what you had to say and I thought it was [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1043.78s)]
*  Extremely well done and especially for someone as young as you I thought it was just [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1048.26s)]
*  Amazing common. Let me ask you [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1053.06s)]
*  What was the reaction from people of color people who've experienced racism perhaps to your talk? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1055.06s)]
*  Because you must have gotten a tremendous amount and I did look at the comments to Ted's credit the comments are open [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1060.8999999999999s)]
*  So what was the reaction? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1065.94s)]
*  You know to to to people like [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1067.94s)]
*  Shamath or yourself people of color who maybe who have experienced racism on some regular basis and this idea of having [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1070.02s)]
*  color blindness when when we're [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1076.5s)]
*  You know operating as a society and that goal which I'll just point out when I listen to your talk seems [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1079.1399999999999s)]
*  To be exactly what Martin Luther King said [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1084.02s)]
*  So go ahead. Yeah, it is [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1086.58s)]
*  So there's the the stereotype of the reaction is that white people like my talk and people of color don't [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1089.06s)]
*  Yes, so that's the stereotype that my critics would like to believe is the reality because then they don't have to confront my arguments [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1096.18s)]
*  The reality is that even at the Ted conference, which is a progressive space [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1104.66s)]
*  many many people of color [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1109.7s)]
*  Black people south asian people came up to me saying that was an excellent talk for this that and the third reason [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1111.8600000000001s)]
*  And I think probably for reasons similar to what you were saying chamath [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1119.54s)]
*  I I've found that [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1127.3s)]
*  Oftentimes immigrants of color really resonate with my message [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1129.78s)]
*  I have many for instance, jamaican friends [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1134.42s)]
*  For instance jamaican friends [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1137.38s)]
*  That you know, they view themselves as jamaican they come to america and our conversation about race doesn't make very much sense to them [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1139.7s)]
*  right why [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1147.94s)]
*  It doesn't make sense for instance to [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1149.94s)]
*  Strongly feel that your racial identity is an aspect of your core inner self [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1153.14s)]
*  That you ought to judge people on the basis of their racial identity that [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1159.46s)]
*  You know if you're a white person that you know, you don't have a valid perspective to bear on a conversation or you have to [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1164.6599999999999s)]
*  You know preface every belief by saying well, i'm a i'm a dumb white guy [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1171.3799999999999s)]
*  What do I know this kind of routine that we've gotten into in spaces rather than just confronting each other as hey [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1175.2199999999998s)]
*  You know, i'm colman you're tramath you're david, etc [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1181.9399999999998s)]
*  let's all talk about this from the point of view of epistemic equals and [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1185.3799999999999s)]
*  Have conversations and yeah, you're gonna know about stuff. I haven't known because of your individual life story [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1191.06s)]
*  I'm gonna i'm gonna have experienced stuff that you haven't we may have even experienced racial discrimination [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1196.58s)]
*  We may we may have stories stories to tell [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1201.54s)]
*  But we are starting out fundamentally from the framework of all being human beings that can talk to each other and [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1203.9399999999998s)]
*  You know, we we don't have to sort of play act these [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1210.34s)]
*  Racial roles that have become increasingly in vogue [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1213.78s)]
*  in woke spaces [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1217.54s)]
*  And a lot of people resonate with that [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1219.62s)]
*  And and and and what's more, you know, you've gotten this thing on the left [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1221.78s)]
*  You've gotten media institutions that have been taken in in by this [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1225.7s)]
*  So you you see new york times op-eds like one I think five years ago. That's can my children be friends with white people? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1229.62s)]
*  Right. You've got robin diangelo in her book saying things like a white person shouldn't cry around a black person because it triggers us [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1236.26s)]
*  It's like this is so the opposite of what it actually feels like to hang out with an interracial and [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1244.1799999999998s)]
*  Tight-knit group of friends your race racial identity recedes in importance the more you get to know people and I think people [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1250.9799999999998s)]
*  In interracial relationships know this people with interracial kids know this [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1258.26s)]
*  So my message actually resonate resonates with people of of all colors [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1262.8999999999999s)]
*  That I think was one of the most poignant parts of it sax. Um, you got to watch the talk as well, I believe so [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1267.3s)]
*  Your thoughts on maybe institutions rotting from the inside and [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1272.66s)]
*  Maybe even one that's supposed to support ideas ideas that matter clearly. This is an idea that matters. I'm curious [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1278.26s)]
*  I just wanted I want to I want to not use the term rotting because I think your your point is that it's not good [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1285.22s)]
*  I don't think that's necessarily the case because the point is there's institutional capture [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1291.78s)]
*  That's happened and that institutional capture is almost like a democratic process that we're seeing at companies that we're seeing [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1296.98s)]
*  At government agencies and that we're seeing in private and non-profit institutions [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1304.18s)]
*  that the individuals that are employed, uh are [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1309.46s)]
*  Capturing the organization's ideals obviously well, that's what I mean by rotting [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1313.76s)]
*  I mean, it's like it's it was such a storied institution, you know in terms of it was a brave institution under Ricky [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1318.02s)]
*  Saul warman, you know, I get it [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1324.18s)]
*  But I think I think rotting is such a derogatory term in the sense that okay some of these institutions evolve to be different [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1325.7s)]
*  But okay, and that's the only thing I I don't want to make it. Yeah sacks of rotting or is it [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1331.7s)]
*  Being taken over from the inside out from the bottom up. What are your thoughts? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1337.54s)]
*  I think captured is a pretty good word to use freeber use that word [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1341.0600000000002s)]
*  Let's remember ted's original mission [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1344.66s)]
*  Represented in their tagline was ideas were spreading [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1347.44s)]
*  So there's supposed to be a forum for interesting [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1351.38s)]
*  Worthy ideas that they're going to spread [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1354.8200000000002s)]
*  And here they're doing the opposite. They're [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1357.38s)]
*  Basically sandbagging the views and they didn't want to publish it at all. And then when they did agree to publish it [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1360.02s)]
*  They basically subjected that to a new requirement of putting a rebuttal right by it [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1365.8600000000001s)]
*  So this is not living up to the original mission now. Why did this happen? I want to go to chris anderson's [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1372.5s)]
*  Response here. He wrote this long [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1378.42s)]
*  Post on x which is too long to read here [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1380.82s)]
*  It's a really sort of weasley mealy-mouth defense of what they did [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1383.7s)]
*  A lot of both sides type language. I think there's really only one or two sentences that are [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1390.26s)]
*  relevant in terms of explaining this whole thing what he says is that [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1396.5s)]
*  Many people have been genuinely hurt and offended by what they heard you say [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1402.18s)]
*  So he's addressing this to colman. This is not what we dream of when we post our talk [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1407.54s)]
*  So I think this is really the key intellectual mistake that chris anderson's making is that he believes [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1411.3s)]
*  That people can be genuinely hurt [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1417.78s)]
*  By encountering well-reasoned ideas they disagree with [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1420.5s)]
*  I think the way that the marketplace ideas are supposed to work [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1424.1799999999998s)]
*  Is that when you encounter an idea you disagree with you formulate an equally well-thought-out response? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1428.26s)]
*  And you engage in intellectual discourse [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1434.6s)]
*  Yeah, maybe get curious. Yeah get curious exactly [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1437.4799999999998s)]
*  But you know, I think these words are really significant because he's saying not just that the objectors here were offended [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1439.9599999999998s)]
*  He was saying that they were hurt genuinely hurt so he's buying into this idea [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1446.84s)]
*  That hearing ideas you disagree with is somehow a threat to your safety. Yeah, and as soon as you do that as soon as you [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1451.6399999999999s)]
*  concede [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1459.7199999999998s)]
*  That there can be some sort of physical harm [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1462.2s)]
*  From engaging with ideas you give the equivalent of a heckler's veto [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1466.04s)]
*  To the people who don't like these ideas [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1471.0s)]
*  It's almost like a crybaby's veto [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1474.04s)]
*  So there's no way you can function as a marketplace of ideas and certainly a platform for ideas worth spreading [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1476.44s)]
*  If you're going to give a veto to people who can claim that their subjective emotional reaction [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1482.36s)]
*  To well-thought ideas should trump [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1488.52s)]
*  The right of the speaker [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1492.12s)]
*  To put out that idea [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1494.6s)]
*  Or the broader audience to hear it right exactly and I think that's and I think that's where we've ended up [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1496.6s)]
*  Coleman, can I ask your point of view on institutional capture? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1501.8799999999999s)]
*  Obviously, this is different than [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1505.3999999999999s)]
*  The topics you've been you've spoken about [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1507.6399999999999s)]
*  But as you've gone through this experience with ted and as you think more broadly about what's going on [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1511.08s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1516.52s)]
*  Do you have a point of view on the capture of institutions from the bottom up that's happened? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1517.8s)]
*  And how that's affected some of these topics like free speech sharing of ideas open discourse [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1522.8400000000001s)]
*  All these foundations that made kind of a free and open society work effectively for so long [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1528.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's a very difficult problem because [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1533.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, it's easy for me from the outside not being the leader of a major institution to to say well [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1537.3200000000002s)]
*  This is just what you have to do [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1542.76s)]
*  Obviously, it's more psychologically difficult to go to your own staff that you have to metaphorically live with every day [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1544.76s)]
*  And really shake things up [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1550.84s)]
*  And many people aren't willing to do that [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1553.24s)]
*  Someone like barry weiss who used to be at the new york times [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1556.04s)]
*  You know her point of view on it is look you just got to start your own institutions [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1559.48s)]
*  You have to start your own institutions with the right ethos from day one [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1564.6s)]
*  And that's what she's tried to do with the free press [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1569.4s)]
*  Rather than try to reform institutions that have a lot of unhealthy inertia that chris could have stopped this very easily [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1572.36s)]
*  I mean, this is a failure of leadership [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1579.1599999999999s)]
*  What he needed to tell these employees is look our mission is to be a platform for spreading interesting ideas [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1581.24s)]
*  And we can't treat this speech differently than any other speech just because you disagree with it [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1588.6799999999998s)]
*  That's all you have to do and by the way, just because an idea may be offensive does not mean that it should not be spread [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1594.28s)]
*  I think have you read a jonathan hates book coddling of the american mind? Absolutely. Yeah, great book [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1601.0800000000002s)]
*  And I think that speaks and that was the book I gave away in our gift bag at the all-in summit this year [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1606.6000000000001s)]
*  because I thought it was such like [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1611.64s)]
*  An important and kind of prescient point of view on what's going on right now that [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1613.3200000000002s)]
*  We assume that if something is offensive by some some group could be a large group or a small group [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1618.1200000000001s)]
*  It needs to be suppressed and obviously as you extend that concept to its extreme you end up losing [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1624.1200000000001s)]
*  many ideas that challenge [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1630.8400000000001s)]
*  You know the current kind of [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1633.72s)]
*  Main concept that everyone believes here's what I don't understand. So colman just [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1635.48s)]
*  Maybe if you can just guess why when somebody watches [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1640.76s)]
*  This talk [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1645.88s)]
*  Could they feel genuinely hurt like what like if we had to [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1648.04s)]
*  Steal mad them let's step in their shoes [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1652.28s)]
*  Like what is the what's the cycle that's going on there? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1655.56s)]
*  That gets them to oh my god, this is an intolerable point of view [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1659.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think there has to be something with if you're a person that has [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1664.8400000000001s)]
*  You know staked your life or your career out on the concept of [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1670.8400000000001s)]
*  sort of race-based [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1675.8000000000002s)]

*  Just argue against that whole approach [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1691.0s)]

*  That's my only guess [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1725.9599999999998s)]

*  And your response and then they said well wouldn't be better if we could have [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1753.24s)]
*  You know some representation in that group. So then we would inspire people to get to the group your response to that was [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1758.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, my response to that was [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1764.4399999999998s)]
*  what you really want to do is [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1766.36s)]

*  Because schools are underfunded or band programs are are horrible in inner cities. That's where you want to intervene [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1774.84s)]
*  You don't want to intervene at the point at the at the meritocratic end line [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1781.4799999999998s)]

*  Losing ground by charles marie. Yes, I have [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1795.48s)]
*  I mean a very provocative book. I have always thought and maybe i'll just leave this with you because if you were willing to do it [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1798.84s)]
*  I for one would love to support you in any way that I could to do it, but [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1806.12s)]
*  We don't have a full accounting [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1809.8s)]
*  Of what really happened starting in the late 1960s with lbj's war on poverty [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1812.36s)]
*  And I think when you look at racism [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1818.52s)]
*  through the american lived experience [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1820.84s)]
*  A lot of it goes back to a bunch of economic incentives that were set up to try to do what theoretically seemed at the time the [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1823.56s)]
*  Right thing we can debate whether that's where lbj came from or not [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1829.3999999999999s)]
*  But you compound and cascade a bunch of decisions forward and to your point now [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1833.3999999999999s)]
*  We're sort of trying to deal with the symptoms without really addressing the root cause [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1837.1599999999999s)]
*  And I think if america wants to really heal and deal with this [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1841.48s)]
*  What we also need to do is give all those people that have that fight or flight response [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1844.12s)]
*  The better toolkit to understand what kind of got us here [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1848.36s)]
*  Because right now we have a very charged way of viewing these things without actually looking at some of the [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1851.56s)]
*  Practical quantifiable details thomas soul has talked about it charles murray talks about it [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1856.74s)]
*  But these are unfortunately such heterodox ideas that they just don't get enough mainstream discussion and [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1863.0s)]
*  If you then compound that with this institutional capture [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1868.4399999999998s)]
*  They get buried and so the answer may actually be sitting right in front of our face [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1872.28s)]
*  Where it was the welfare reform system that we implemented in the late 1960s on down the line [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1876.68s)]
*  Because those are structural ways where we can solve it which ultimately will get to your point, which is great [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1883.4s)]
*  Fund more music in the schools in that example [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1888.5200000000002s)]
*  And right now we're so caught up in all of the [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1891.48s)]
*  The labels and the fear-mongering that we never get to that and so I just wanted to put that out there that I think [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1894.2s)]
*  That there needs to be [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1898.68s)]
*  smart brilliant people like yourself young people [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1900.3600000000001s)]
*  Who can do a full accounting of like the last 50 or 60 years in a much more structural way [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1903.48s)]
*  That these gentlemen tried to do but the ideas were just two heterodox at the time [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1907.8s)]
*  But because of formats like podcasts and like the free press and other things [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1911.96s)]
*  I think there's a chance that you can actually get these ideas out [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1915.72s)]
*  and I think it's important because [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1918.76s)]
*  I think folks like me or the people that approached you [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1921.08s)]
*  there's not enough of us that came from this background that are open-minded or [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1924.12s)]
*  At a point where we can tolerate the anxiety to listen to your ideas [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1928.5200000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of people that may just viscerally react [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1931.88s)]
*  but the more that we can shift those people away from viscerally reacting to actually [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1934.92s)]
*  Tolerating and then thinking and then evolving their point of view you can do some enormous good in the world [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1939.14s)]
*  Just so I just wanted to put that out there. Yeah [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1945.4s)]
*  Yeah, I know that I mean that's a huge topic and an understudied topic [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1948.2800000000002s)]
*  What was the effect of of the welfare reforms of the 60s and 70s? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1951.72s)]
*  I know my mother used to say she grew up in the south bronx. I'm half hispanic half black american [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1955.24s)]
*  and she used to say uh [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1961.08s)]
*  She used to just have stories of you know [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1963.24s)]
*  When the welfare auditors would come around and people would hide their boyfriends hide their husbands exactly [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1964.76s)]
*  And in the book black power by stokely carmichael, um aka kwame terre which is uh, you know the [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1971.72s)]
*  Manifesto of the black power movement hardly a a right-wing source [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1978.58s)]
*  They they made the same point about welfare reform so there definitely is something to be investigated there [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1982.6s)]
*  um, it's not really my [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1987.96s)]
*  Point of expertise. I know glen laury is someone who has really you know dug into that sort of research [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1990.04s)]
*  But there's definitely a a lot of room for study there [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1995.3999999999999s)]
*  Govind let me ask you a question about our industry. We've had a lot of hand-wringing and debates about diversity [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=1999.72s)]
*  in funding of startups [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2007.24s)]
*  Capital allocators venture capital firms and um [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2009.32s)]
*  We have limited partners who have a mission to have more diverse [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2014.28s)]
*  General partners the people had venture firms who invest in startups invest in more female led startups, etc because the numbers frankly [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2019.24s)]
*  You know have not been um very diverse [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2026.92s)]
*  Historically in venture far from it and we recently had a female [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2030.5s)]
*  A black female venture firm, I think it's called fearless founders get sued. I'm not sure if you're aware of that lawsuit [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2035.96s)]
*  It's by the same person who sued harvard [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2041.72s)]
*  Should there be [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2045.0800000000002s)]
*  venture firms specifically designed to change the ratio it's the language people use and should [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2046.76s)]
*  You know people with large endowments of capital be backing [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2053.96s)]
*  You know black venture capitalists to see more of them or female black venture capitalists hispanic etc [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2057.88s)]
*  Or how would you look at that issue which has been a pretty sticky issue and hasn't changed for a long time [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2063.56s)]
*  So prescriptively I don't want to say much because I don't like to tell people how to run their funds or run their businesses [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2070.28s)]
*  Right if you're a christian and you want to hire only christian people if you're a muslim you want to hire only muslims [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2075.64s)]
*  I think you should frankly be allowed to do that if those are your personal values now personally I will tell you [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2080.84s)]
*  With respect to the people that I would hire to say work on my podcast [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2086.52s)]
*  I want every single hire to know that I am not hiring them as a result of their skin color or gender [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2090.6s)]
*  or [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2098.36s)]
*  any other [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2099.32s)]
*  Contingent feature of of their identity. I want them to know that i'm hiring them for what they really bring to the table [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2101.14s)]
*  Now I have a very small team. Maybe there's something about how the optics certain optics are required for a larger [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2107.88s)]
*  um a larger firm, but I think it it [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2115.24s)]
*  the problems begin when you [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2119.08s)]
*  When you sort of bless this idea that race is a super deep feature of who you are right from the start [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2122.44s)]
*  When you bless that idea right from the start [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2128.2799999999997s)]
*  It sends the signal that what people bring to the table is their racial identity is their gender [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2130.8399999999997s)]
*  Now when you fast forward two years down the line when a company is having some meltdown over a race or a gender issue [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2137.08s)]
*  You have to understand that it's possible you made this bed [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2143.3199999999997s)]
*  By signaling from the very beginning that what's important about the people you're bringing in is their race is their gender and that you are [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2146.7599999999998s)]
*  uh vulnerable to the kinds of appeals that can be made purely on the basis of what are ultimately [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2154.6s)]
*  superficial features of our identity [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2160.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's well said what would your advice be to institutional leaders? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2163.7999999999997s)]
*  That are past that point of no return the ceos of big companies and big institutions [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2168.2s)]
*  That are now captives by these ideologies [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2173.6600000000003s)]
*  Where they are effectively as you say ultra sensitive to issues around [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2177.42s)]
*  race and gender and other sort of you know superficial identities [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2182.6200000000003s)]
*  And are challenged often to to make decisions or driven to make decisions that [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2187.5s)]
*  their [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2192.86s)]
*  Employees and teams demand of them. Do you have advice on how they can rethink? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2193.7400000000002s)]
*  Their roles as leaders and how to reframe this I mean in a word [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2198.2200000000003s)]
*  No, because it's by that point [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2201.9s)]
*  It's uh, it's it's an intractable intractable problem. I've had i've talked to ceos [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2204.78s)]
*  That asked this question to me over and over again [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2210.3s)]
*  You know like what do I do once i'm past the point where I have so many staff [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2212.3s)]
*  And it's it's you know, the system is so sprawling that it's no longer under my control [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2216.5400000000004s)]
*  I have so many people with values that I don't share that I frankly think privately are insane [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2221.1000000000004s)]
*  But I cannot say so publicly because I have higher order commitments [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2227.1s)]
*  To the shareholders to the board to to steer the ship, right such as it is and the ship cannot be changed at this point [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2231.34s)]
*  I don't have good advice. I'm not going to pretend that I do [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2238.7s)]

*  12 or 7500 and then no they used to be 7500 then I think they went up to 10k [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2391.42s)]
*  And then you can do like donor tickets and you get different features and so on basically they're sold out [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2396.2999999999997s)]
*  remember it is set up as a non-profit and [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2401.1s)]
*  There is philanthropic work that's done. And so, you know, the organization is again, it's not a [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2404.22s)]
*  Profiteering media company it it became a big media company because of the success of the the efforts and the quality of the content [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2410.52s)]
*  That was produced over time [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2417.74s)]
*  but you know as we talked about a lot of media companies and a lot of institutions get captured and [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2419.98s)]
*  You know the original kind of missing paraphrase to paraphrase, uh, bruce willis in pulp fiction [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2426.54s)]

*  Niche elite views to veto or suppress talks. They don't like [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2443.42s)]

*  I doubt it [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2472.6200000000003s)]
*  You know in the they had sarah silverman and she did a comedy set which was hilarious and the same people [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2473.42s)]
*  So this is the thing I find so the hypocrisy is just so crazy with the ted people and it's a lot of my friends still [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2478.86s)]
*  Go [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2485.02s)]
*  Is they had sarah silverman come these people have laughed at sarah silverman a million times. They've watched dave chappelle [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2486.1400000000003s)]
*  They've seen any number of comics, you know, make them laugh with edgy humor [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2493.42s)]
*  But then when they're in that [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2498.78s)]
*  You know ted audience and they're feeling super precious and that they're very important because they donate 50 grand a year or whatever [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2500.1400000000003s)]
*  Friedberg gave them. I don't know to get in there from the side door [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2506.54s)]
*  Then they were super offended [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2511.18s)]
*  So, you know, they're hypocrites and I don't know how to say it anymore. Clearly they literally [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2513.18s)]
*  You could pull up [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2518.46s)]
*  Chris anderson apologizing not just again again. I really apologize for a comedian [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2519.9s)]
*  I mean, I I I hope that this is a learning experience for everyone [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2525.74s)]
*  I hope that this is a turning point for leadership in institutions like this to take a look at what happened [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2529.66s)]
*  How it happened and then hopefully to write the course because organizations like ted I thought were very important and [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2534.38s)]
*  Should be in the world and should be successful and I hope that they kind of return to the original values [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2539.58s)]
*  And I hope that this is a moment that that there's a learning experience and that we don't just shit on them and say [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2544.06s)]
*  They're awful. They're failed. It's over. Hopefully something comes to this. I do think there is one other potential remedy here [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2548.3s)]
*  Which besides just starting a new ted [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2555.26s)]
*  Um and kind of the barry weiss point of view which is just write it off and start over [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2557.9s)]
*  Remember what brian armstrong did at coinbase. He basically just said listen, we have a mission here. It's around crypto [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2562.38s)]
*  we're going to focus 100 on this mission and if you're not on board with this mission or want to [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2567.9s)]
*  Capture this institution to promote other missions. This is not the place for you. Go do those missions somewhere else [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2572.78s)]
*  He took a hit. Yeah, he the New York Times wrote their obligatory hit piece if chris was brave [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2579.6600000000003s)]
*  He would just tell everybody. Oh, no, that's what I would say if chris has good mentors [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2584.38s)]
*  As well as a good sounding board [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2590.64s)]
*  That is the threshold question that should be debated right now is do I walk in the door? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2592.8799999999997s)]
*  and do I [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2597.68s)]
*  Just give this simple litmus test and have people sign up or not and yeah [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2599.12s)]
*  We can it's quite and it's quite easy because to your point [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2603.2799999999997s)]
*  It's not like he's inventing something new. He's saying this is where we started and this is where we're going to stay [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2606.3199999999997s)]
*  And this is what it means and if he doesn't do that [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2612.0s)]
*  Then he's spoken with his actions and it is what it is. It'll what is meant to happen exactly will then happen exactly [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2615.12s)]
*  And exactly it's a it's a moment for looking at the internal compass. It's a wholesale leadership reset moment opportunity [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2621.2s)]
*  See if it happens or not or double down and keep going. I really appreciate your [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2627.52s)]

*  It turns out that this person [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2685.6800000000003s)]
*  first fought [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2689.52s)]
*  For the first ukrainian division in world war two [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2691.44s)]

*  So the canadian parliament [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2705.6800000000003s)]

*  You're canadian. Uh, so your thoughts on what we've seen here [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2716.08s)]
*  I mean i'll give you my feedback as somebody who [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2720.32s)]
*  when I [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2724.64s)]
*  Was you know in canada? [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2725.76s)]
*  Was a pretty ardent liberal [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2728.88s)]
*  I grew up in a liberal household my [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2731.6s)]
*  father canvassed religiously for the liberals [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2734.08s)]
*  And I think that at some point after I moved to the united states [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2738.32s)]
*  They took wokeism which I think look at some level was rooted in something very important which was [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2743.28s)]
*  How do you get marginalized folks to be seen? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2750.16s)]
*  And so I think we all would agree that it's kind of become this virus [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2753.52s)]
*  The thing that it masks are all of these other really bad things that come along with it [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2758.48s)]
*  And one of them in canada, which justin trudeau is case zero of is also when nepotism goes bad [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2763.7599999999998s)]

*  Who was up until that point a substitute teacher? [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2803.6s)]

*  And elected in prime minister [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2813.52s)]
*  And what happened was he became the sort of like virtue signaller in chief of this very important ga country [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2816.3999999999996s)]
*  And it was all kind of bumbling along [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2825.8399999999997s)]
*  And in the absence of anybody else that was able to step up and offer an alternative he got reelected barely, but he did [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2828.56s)]
*  And then these things happened in the last year and when you look through that prism is how you can see [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2834.56s)]
*  What happens if a country doesn't draw a line and finally take a stand? So we had [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2841.92s)]
*  This guy who was ill qualified and way over his head who shouldn't have been in this role as prime minister get put in that position [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2847.84s)]
*  When finally a group of people in canada pushed back in this case the truckers [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2854.64s)]
*  He and the entire government explicitly labeled them as nazis [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2859.44s)]
*  Right and said these people need to be put down and completely [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2864.34s)]
*  dismantled [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2868.72s)]
*  It didn't seem like it was right. We called that out [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2870.74s)]
*  We all talked about it and we said this doesn't smell right on the surface [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2873.3s)]
*  These are really seems like good earnest people that are just trying to make a point and are not being heard [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2876.5s)]
*  then you had this thing three weeks ago two or three weeks ago where [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2882.58s)]
*  He actually had a speech [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2887.38s)]
*  In front of the entire parliament where he accused the largest democracy in the world [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2889.46s)]
*  india in this case [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2894.42s)]
*  Of coming into canada canadian soil and assassinating a canadian citizen [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2895.94s)]
*  Which is an enormous allegation to levy [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2900.66s)]
*  And what was important to know about that allegation was that it was done without the explicit vocal support of either britain or the united [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2903.62s)]
*  United states which would be the two most natural allies that canada would present that information to and instead of doing it [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2911.54s)]
*  Behind a closed door to modi [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2918.18s)]
*  He did it on live stage like it was like some theatrical performance [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2921.38s)]
*  Then india follows up and says um this guy's kind of known to be a little bit of a drug addict [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2926.1s)]
*  It was on a two-day bender and the indian drug dog smelled a bunch of cocaine on the plane [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2930.98s)]
*  Then they have this thing for vladimir zolenski where everybody was there to sort of like virtue signal this war and then they actually [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2937.46s)]
*  Invited a nazi and then gave him a standing ovation [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2945.94s)]
*  So when you when you put it all together, I think what it shows is just a lack of [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2948.98s)]
*  Professionalism [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2954.64s)]
*  Which also belies just the lack of experience and capability and so I think what it shows is just like [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2956.1s)]
*  Isn't this enough like have we not seen enough of these examples where you can actually start to ask yourself [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2963.14s)]
*  Why can't we just get really good competent people to do these jobs? [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2969.14s)]
*  Why can't we actually embrace free speech and all of what it means and explore that why can't we have people that? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2972.9s)]
*  Don't need to theatrically perform on stage because eventually [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2977.78s)]
*  You're going to make these mistakes and you're going to embarrass your entire country [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2981.2200000000003s)]
*  And then you're going to imperil relations with some really important allies [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2984.82s)]
*  And I think this is a moment in time where all of those things need to be questioned and put on the table [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2988.82s)]
*  you're clearly questioning his competence here because [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2993.86s)]
*  to [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2997.62s)]
*  Not have the care to check who is going to speak in front of parliament is crazy [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=2998.66s)]
*  And just to make it super clear the speaker that invited hunker [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3004.3399999999997s)]
*  That was anthony rota resigned on tuesday and trudeau says rota the person who invited the nazi [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3009.06s)]
*  Is solely responsible [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3015.94s)]
*  Well, then he blamed russian misinformation on top of that [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3017.7799999999997s)]
*  But jason you don't you don't the prime minister who is the most important politician in the country [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3020.1s)]
*  Doesn't show up someplace unless the office knows who else is going to be there [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3024.74s)]
*  He knew that zelenci was going to be there. He would have known who the guest list was [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3028.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, no, this was this was just going to cover it up but but the bigger issue is to be clear [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3032.7400000000002s)]
*  You're not saying that they invited a nazi [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3037.7000000000003s)]
*  On purpose and cheered for a nazi on purpose where nobody's saying that you're saying there's a lack of care here and it's [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3040.34s)]
*  It's a lack of competence. It's a lack of competence. Yeah, just so we're clear. Yeah. Okay, so I agree with all of that. I think there's also [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3047.06s)]
*  Two other dimensions to this backstory if you will [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3054.18s)]
*  I think first in terms of how does a mistake like this happen? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3057.78s)]
*  I think it was orwell who said that he who controls the president controls the past and he who controls the past controls the future [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3061.54s)]
*  The president is ukraine. It is the current thing everybody has to cheer for ukraine and for the killing of russians [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3069.86s)]
*  The reason why hunker was cheered with a standing ovation is because they said that he fought [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3077.2200000000003s)]
*  Russians he was a war hero who fought russians [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3083.06s)]
*  All you had to do was do a little bit of math to realize the guy's 98 years old [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3085.46s)]
*  When was there a war against russia who could he possibly have been fighting for but [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3088.66s)]
*  To the extent people did that they sort of airbrushed it or [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3093.54s)]
*  Whitewash history. So the president controls the past [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3097.14s)]
*  to ensure [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3100.74s)]
*  A a vision of the future which trudeau laid out in this speech. He gave recently [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3102.02s)]
*  Where he became so ardent in his support for ukraine. He was almost [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3106.8999999999996s)]
*  Yelling at the podium saying that canada had to make all these economic sacrifices to win the war [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3112.42s)]
*  So that's point number one is I think that the woke mind virus [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3118.2599999999998s)]
*  Almost requires this whitewashing of the past but it's done for a specific purpose [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3122.5s)]
*  Which is to control the future but they're not whitewashing the past if it was a mistake that intellectually doesn't make sense [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3127.06s)]
*  No, what they did is what they're saying if i'm understanding you correctly. Yeah, the present [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3132.9s)]
*  Is that we hate russia so much? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3138.3399999999997s)]
*  That we're going to cheer for anybody who killed russians. Okay, I understand your point [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3141.38s)]
*  But you're you're agreeing that they did not knowingly put a nazi on there. So it was a mistake got it [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3145.38s)]
*  I don't think they they knowingly did it. It was a huge [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3149.2200000000003s)]
*  debacle and embarrassing spectacle [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3151.92s)]
*  No, I think that nobody asked any questions about the past because the president [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3154.34s)]
*  Overrides it. Okay, sure the president need to support the current thing [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3158.96s)]
*  Overrides like any sort of examination of what has happened [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3163.46s)]
*  Historically, there's one other way in which I think this wasn't an accident. Jason [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3167.36s)]
*  Is that if you look at us policy towards ukraine, we have made common cause [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3172.5s)]
*  With a number of these far-right ultra-nationalist groups [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3177.78s)]
*  Frankly neo-nazi groups and this occurred before the the current war so it's not just a marriage of convenience [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3181.3s)]
*  First of all, if you go back to war two the the father of ukrainian nationalism is a guy named stepin bandera [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3188.34s)]
*  And today in ukraine he is seen as some sort of hero [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3194.9s)]
*  And there are streets named after him and there are streets named after some of his co-conspirators who collaborated with nazis if you [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3198.58s)]
*  Fast forward to the more recent past to 2014 [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3206.1000000000004s)]
*  When we had this, uh, made on coup [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3210.26s)]
*  In kiev that was backed by victoria newland [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3213.38s)]
*  one of the key figures in that coup was [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3216.58s)]
*  A guy named ola tony bok who is the founder of this vododa party [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3220.02s)]
*  Which is the social [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3225.2999999999997s)]
*  nationalist party [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3227.4399999999996s)]
*  Which if you know what nazi stands for its national socialist they basically just flipped the name [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3228.8199999999997s)]
*  And the original logo of this vododa party was the wolf's angel, which was a nazi insignia [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3234.1s)]
*  this was a far right [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3240.8199999999997s)]
*  party infused with the [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3242.9799999999996s)]
*  racial ideology of stepin bandera who was again a nazi [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3245.3799999999997s)]
*  And they brought this guy in and his party as the muscle in this coup [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3250.5s)]
*  If you look at the victoria newland phone call the infamous phone call where she is picking the new ukrainian government [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3254.98s)]
*  The the yats is our guy phone call. She says that [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3260.82s)]
*  Clitch meaning klitschko and and tony bok needs to remain on the outside, but yats needs to be talking to tony bok four times a week [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3264.26s)]
*  Okay, he was part of the chess pieces that they were moving around [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3272.5s)]
*  After the coup a civil war breaks out in the donbass [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3277.14s)]
*  Because the ethnic russians there are opposed to this new government and the fact that yanukovych who they voted for [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3280.42s)]
*  Was deposed in an insurrection [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3287.3s)]
*  What happens then is a war breaks out where far-right paramilitary organizations like right sector and like the infamous azoff battalion [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3289.62s)]
*  Start killing these ethnic russian separatists [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3298.5s)]
*  And a full-blown civil war breaks out thousands of people get killed [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3301.7s)]
*  Does the kiev government suppress [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3305.38s)]
*  These neo-nazi groups. No, they bring them under the formal command structure [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3308.7400000000002s)]
*  Of the ukrainian military azoff battalion becomes a division [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3313.94s)]
*  Of the ukrainian military it's shocking [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3319.1400000000003s)]
*  And this goes on from 2014 through 2021 the ukrainian army just to be clear here has nazis in it [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3322.02s)]
*  Nazi supporters [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3329.2999999999997s)]
*  There's no question about that and there are many people who are concerned about this in the 2015 to 2020 time frame [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3330.5s)]
*  There were many articles written about it. The nation had an article about it [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3337.62s)]
*  There were efforts in congress at various points to try and ensure that the aid that we were giving to the ukrainian government did not go [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3340.8199999999997s)]
*  So so let's so it is said so it is said, okay, I think the important and and [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3349.2999999999997s)]
*  Do you think zelensky is a nazi or a nazi? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3354.42s)]
*  No, I don't think he's a nazi and to be clear [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3356.9s)]
*  I don't think most ukrainians are nazis and I don't even think that most ukrainian nationalists are nazis [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3358.98s)]
*  What i'm saying is that there is a nazi element in ukraine that my percent whitewashed over [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3364.26s)]
*  Well, here's the thing about it. I don't think it's a huge percentage [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3370.26s)]
*  But I think they have outsized influence due to their willingness to use violence due to their extremism [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3373.14s)]
*  And their willingness to use violence. I think it's any different than the nazi percentage in [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3379.2200000000003s)]
*  Say what whatever you want to say white supremacists in the united states or in germany or anywhere else? [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3383.7s)]
*  I do I think it's different in the sense that in the united states is for sure we have [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3389.54s)]
*  Neo nazi groups. They're not brought into the military. We don't have streets named after their patriarchs [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3394.58s)]
*  Furthermore, we don't have members of our military with nazi insignia on them. There was a new york times article just a few months ago [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3401.38s)]
*  talking about [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3408.42s)]
*  the fact that embarrassingly [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3409.7s)]
*  A lot of these ukrainian soldiers are being photographed with nazi insignia on their uniforms [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3412.5s)]
*  Now the new york times is framing this as a problem because it was a propaganda coup for putin [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3418.02s)]
*  And presumably it was but I think it's a problem because it's a problem not because of just the pr optics of it [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3422.98s)]
*  And you know at various points, I think this is in the new york times article as well western media has had to airbrush [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3430.74s)]
*  These photos to hide this fact now [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3436.1s)]
*  Oh the new york times has airbrushed photos of nazi i don't think new york times has but I don't think new york times has [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3438.8199999999997s)]
*  But I think they talk about [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3444.58s)]
*  This thorny problem of not wanting to show these photos with respect to the zelensky being jewish [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3446.18s)]
*  so what i'd say about that is that [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3451.46s)]
*  Zelensky only came on the scene quite recently. He got elected in 2019 [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3454.58s)]
*  And again, I don't think the majority of people in ukraine are nazis. Okay, so i'm not saying that [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3460.1s)]
*  But just because zelensky came on the scene in 2019 and was elected president doesn't mean there's a long and I would say disturbing history [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3465.9399999999996s)]
*  and association [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3473.62s)]
*  between [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3475.2999999999997s)]
*  ukrainian ultra-nationalism and neo-nazi groups and I think that part of the the woke thing and part of this orwellian [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3476.3199999999997s)]
*  Desire where control the president gives you the ability to rewrite the past is that there's been a deliberate effort to cover up this problem [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3483.14s)]
*  And to pretend it doesn't exist to turn a blind eye to it [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3490.66s)]
*  Well, my point is that u.s. Policy has been to do this in other words the u.s [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3494.5s)]
*  They are government. Yeah, okay the u.s. State department and presumably cia [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3500.18s)]
*  Made common cause with these far-right groups because we thought it was beneficial to be aligned with them [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3505.7799999999997s)]
*  And so we did it in the may donkoo in 2014 from 2015 to 2021 [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3511.14s)]
*  We could have gone along with efforts under the minska courts to resolve this conflict in the donbass peacefully [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3516.02s)]
*  But we never did that. We never gave it any support [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3522.5s)]
*  And instead we gave support to the kiev regime's attempt to violently suppress these russian separatists [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3526.02s)]
*  And again, the suppression was being done by these right-wing groups. Look, does that make our state department nazis? [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3530.98s)]
*  No, does that make the canadian parliament nazis? [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3537.46s)]
*  No, what i'm saying is that in both cases a blind eye was turned to this disturbing [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3540.1s)]
*  Ideology and past and associations of these people because it's politically in our interest to do business with them [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3546.3399999999997s)]
*  And that's the problematic thing about it. So I don't think in that sense. This was just [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3552.98s)]
*  Sort of an accident. This is the backstory that explains like something like this can happen. Yeah [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3557.3799999999997s)]
*  Okay, jason you have any reactions to trudeau doing this and what it means or does it mean nothing does the backstory I provided? [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3563.2999999999997s)]
*  give you [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3570.8999999999996s)]
*  Context on how something like this can happen [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3572.1s)]
*  That's not just like an accident [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3574.66s)]
*  Well, I don't think any of us know exactly what happened here and it's probably going to be some sort of investigation [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3576.2599999999998s)]
*  But I don't think they knowingly put a nazi up there. Um, I think they are pro the war and that probably [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3580.9s)]
*  Could that have blinded them to do deeper research? Sure people are political politicians most of all [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3587.22s)]
*  and um people probably take facts or [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3593.46s)]
*  you know any kind of [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3597.38s)]
*  Anything they can use to to [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3599.06s)]
*  Make their case stronger [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3602.02s)]
*  They'll take the advantage of that. So yeah, sure and it is trudeau a [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3603.54s)]
*  Zelensky was pumping his fists and cheering. Don't you think he knew he can't not know the history [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3607.94s)]
*  Yeah, he has to know he has to know if he does then somebody was fighting the russian war too [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3613.2999999999997s)]
*  Good question if he did on the german side if he did then you would be saying [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3619.38s)]
*  If he did know and he was pumping his fist then you'd be saying [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3624.82s)]
*  That he was pro nazi he was cheering for a nazi knowingly [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3628.02s)]
*  You know what i'm saying is look the fact that you've got some jewish answer street is not in my view a gedadiel free card [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3632.02s)]
*  No, no, i'm not saying that i'm never even brought up the jewish part to align. Are you saying he knowingly? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3638.34s)]
*  Are you saying he knowingly cheered for a nazi? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3643.54s)]
*  You know one of the big backers of the azoth battalion is a ukrainian oligarch named igor kolomoisky [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3645.6200000000003s)]
*  Kolomoisky is jewish. No, he didn't answer my questions. He asked me my opinion [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3651.86s)]
*  I'm just saying do you do you think he knowingly cheered for a nazi? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3655.54s)]
*  Is that what you're insinuating? [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3658.1s)]
*  I think he knowingly cheered knowing that this ukrainian nationalist who fought in world war two must have been on the german side [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3659.14s)]
*  Because there was only one side that was fighting the russians. Okay. I'm just clarifying here. I I don't actually have an opinion [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3665.14s)]
*  Thanks for uh, querying me. I'm not saying that he cheered for nazism [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3670.82s)]
*  What i'm saying is he cheered for ukrainian nationalism and he knows that ukrainian nationalism is [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3674.18s)]
*  Bound up and tied up with this disturbing history, which he is willing to ignore [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3679.38s)]
*  Do you guys do you guys let me finish my point about the azoth battalion the azoth battalion is undeniably a neo-nazi group [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3683.38s)]
*  It was funded by igor kolomoisky who is a ukrainian oligarch who is jewish who lives in israel [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3690.02s)]
*  Why would kolomoisky do that because the azoth battalion believes that every inch of ukraine including kremia and donbass which has enormous energy reserves [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3694.98s)]
*  Belongs to ukraine so it served the business interests [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3704.1s)]
*  Of the energy magnates in ukraine to support these people [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3707.78s)]
*  And that look politics makes for strange bedfellows. Yeah, very old say actually. Yeah, so i'm not saying that zelensky or kolomoisky or [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3712.5s)]
*  Anybody else is a nazi because they aligned with these people [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3721.38s)]
*  I'm saying they found it politically expedient and useful to align with these groups just like the u.s [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3724.58s)]
*  State department did quite frankly [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3729.06s)]
*  I don't think we should do that [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3730.66s)]
*  If you want to go around the world jason saying that we're the champions of freedom and democracy and having this moralistic almost virtue [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3732.26s)]
*  Signaling foreign policy. I don't think we should be in business or aligned with these neo-nazi groups wherever the hell they are [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3739.1400000000003s)]
*  I think it's when you say you do you mean me or do you mean the united states? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3745.86s)]
*  I'm saying if you want to have a highly moralistic foreign policy [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3750.26s)]
*  Let's say if one wants to have i would use the word. Yeah, if you're going to be principled [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3754.34s)]
*  You need to keep them. You need to not support nazis. We're in agreement. What do you jason and freeber? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3758.9s)]
*  What do you guys think of just like the the breadcrumbs in canada? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3763.06s)]
*  I'm just curious whether you guys care about this whole [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3766.7400000000002s)]
*  vein of just like [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3769.3s)]
*  Competent leadership nepotism if you have a view or it's like that is just what it is and whatever [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3770.58s)]
*  I don't know enough about canadian politics really but trudeau does not seem to be super qualified [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3777.78s)]
*  Yeah, um, so [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3783.3s)]
*  But I don't know enough about it [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3786.42s)]
*  So just in terms of the canadian part of this there's a writer named jeet here who's a left-wing writer [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3787.7000000000003s)]
*  But he posted something very interesting here where he explained that in the late 1940s 1950s canada took in a large number of former [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3792.1s)]
*  Nazis many of him were ss veterans so people like hanka because they were good anti-communists [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3799.38s)]
*  And then these nazis proceeded to terrorize anti-nazi ukrainian canadians. There was this ukrainian hall was bombed here in 1950 [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3805.06s)]
*  So canada has a weird history of bringing in some of these people after world war two [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3812.82s)]
*  So the point is what were that [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3818.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Look, there's no way that any semi-intelligent person who knows the history of world war two, especially the ukrainian involvement in world war two [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3820.4199999999996s)]
*  Wouldn't know [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3829.62s)]
*  that ukraine [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3830.98s)]
*  Was on the german side in world war two [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3832.4199999999996s)]
*  And hanka volunteered for the ss [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3835.14s)]
*  He was a volunteer for the ss. Galicia division [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3839.22s)]
*  So look did the speaker of the house know probably not I think wokeness makes people stupid where [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3841.62s)]
*  They just think about the current thing and I don't ask too many questions about the past [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3847.4599999999996s)]
*  But there's a lot more to it than just like this innocent mistake [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3851.7799999999997s)]
*  And this has been your update on this week in [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3855.3799999999997s)]
*  ukraine [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3858.58s)]
*  And wokeness. All right. There's a bunch of news about opening eye this week [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3860.2599999999998s)]

*  I'm, not sure how much of that is the 20 a month subscription. You know, that'd be pretty extraordinary if that was those personal subscriptions [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3943.94s)]

*  You're going to need to get a license. You're going to want to get access to [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3994.98s)]
*  Whatever developer program whatever beta [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=3999.2999999999997s)]
*  That open ai has and so as a result [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4003.8599999999997s)]
*  That's already happened by the way. Well, I was just going to say so he'll be in the catbird seat [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4006.8199999999997s)]
*  So even if he doesn't have any equity in open ai [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4010.66s)]
*  He'll get he'll just put his money into the best startups that it's like why combinator on steroids [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4014.3399999999997s)]
*  I have a take on that whole claim that sam doesn't own any part of open ai. All right, let's hear it [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4019.54s)]
*  Well, go ahead columbo [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4026.3399999999997s)]
*  Explain to us the details. It's one more thing there ma'am. Well, you said you don't own any shares in open ai [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4028.3399999999997s)]
*  But you started open ai right? Well, then who does yeah, that's the thing [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4033.46s)]
*  What I think is really interesting about what open ai has done in its fundraising rounds is that each round has been a capped return model [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4038.8199999999997s)]
*  so [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4046.3399999999997s)]
*  Explain what that is to the 100x 100x right? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4047.14s)]
*  I think some of the very early people got capped at 100x. I think maybe the 30 billion dollar round was capped at 10x [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4050.3399999999997s)]
*  So I think the 30 billion dollar rounds capped at a 300 million dollar valuation meaning if you're an investor your shares go up [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4056.58s)]
*  In value till the company hits a market cap a 300 billion and then basically you're effectively cashed out [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4062.1s)]
*  It's like you bought a share [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4067.7799999999997s)]
*  But sold a call [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4069.54s)]
*  Back to the company [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4071.46s)]
*  This is how the movie industry works this way, right? You invest in a film [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4072.98s)]
*  They tell you you can make three acts and then it's over right something like that [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4076.5s)]
*  I've seen that in the independent film business. Yeah [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4079.54s)]
*  Yeah [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4081.86s)]
*  So so in any event, I think people who invested like the two billion dollar valuation were capped at like 100 billion [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4082.1s)]
*  I heard that employees who were getting stock options are capped at 100 billion or they were way back when they started granting these things [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4087.46s)]
*  so my point is that if [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4093.86s)]
*  Open ai turns into one of these companies like a google ends up in the trillion dollar club [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4096.26s)]
*  Then nobody's gonna own anything because they will have already long ago [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4101.38s)]
*  Well, they'll keep selling new interests like the new interest will end up being like maybe 8% [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4106.34s)]
*  No, because what will happen at the end is the new people that buy in at that higher price that buy out the early investors [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4110.82s)]
*  They're getting effectively things like 8% [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4117.22s)]
*  Return it turns into debt eventually turns into some I think what's really going on here is somebody has to [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4120.02s)]
*  Own the residual value of the company call it the far out of the money [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4126.099999999999s)]
*  Call option around the irs problem of it being non-equity. That's how they say that it's not equity in a private corporation [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4130.82s)]
*  Yeah, but I think I think what's so brilliant about it is okay. So look sam set up this foundation. That's a non-profit [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4137.219999999999s)]
*  But he controls that effectively, right? Yep [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4143.38s)]
*  So yes, he technically is not an owner of the shares the foundation is but what can't you do with the foundation? [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4146.179999999999s)]
*  That you could do with personal ownership other than maybe buying a personal residence [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4152.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean you can buy a plane. I think look at the church of Scientology. They own a lot of real estate [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4157.38s)]
*  So my point is [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4162.58s)]
*  Not only do I think that sam really owns open ai through the fig leaf this foundation [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4164.02s)]
*  I think he owns 100% of it in the event that the call option is struck [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4168.9800000000005s)]
*  Meaning it ends up being a trillion dollar company. Are you saying sam is elron hubbard in this example? [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4174.34s)]
*  Let's not speculate too much. Why oh, it's just details right as renown said those are just details [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4180.820000000001s)]
*  I am speculating, but I think it's [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4186.42s)]
*  Informed speculation if you wanted to become the world's first trillionaire and you were extremely [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4188.740000000001s)]
*  Uh premeditated about it clever and premeditated about it. What would you do number one? [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4194.660000000001s)]
*  You would want to choose a moonshot type area. That was a world-changing technology ai certainly qualifies ultimate. So it's called fusion [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4200.1s)]
*  Maybe crypto does as I understand the sam has bets in all three of those areas number two [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4207.860000000001s)]
*  You would want to figure out a way to own [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4213.22s)]
*  As much of it as you could really 100% if you could [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4215.62s)]
*  And that's a very hard thing to do when you're running a capital intensive startup, but investors tend to underestimate [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4218.5s)]
*  The power law and the value of the far out of the money call option [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4225.780000000001s)]
*  So maybe you can get them to sell that back to you really cheaply and third if you're really far-sighted [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4229.860000000001s)]
*  You would want to insulate yourself against populist anger from being the world's first trillion [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4234.82s)]
*  So you would basically put your shares in a non-profit foundation where you're not really sacrificing that much of control [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4240.82s)]
*  Or the ability to control the asset but it gives you tremendous. I love you conspiracy theory [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4249.0599999999995s)]
*  Where did you come up with this? Is this like this is genius? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4255.0599999999995s)]
*  This is genius. Did just you and peter teal talk about this over chess or something? [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4258.34s)]
*  How did you construct this and you're saying this is informed financial conspiracy corner? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4261.78s)]
*  I think this is science corner. Let's get the tinfoil hats out. It's really freaking friedberg out that we're even doing this [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4267.219999999999s)]
*  diametrically opposite to science corner. Is it a conspiracy or is it just reality? I think if you are even 1% right the [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4273.759999999999s)]
*  combination of [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4281.36s)]
*  lawyers and accountants that would leak this and the number of people [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4282.98s)]
*  that were part of the origination of the foundation that would want to [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4287.3s)]
*  Sue will be very high. That's just the natural state of things in these kinds of things [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4291.86s)]
*  It seems like a lot easier way [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4296.98s)]
*  But what have I said other than the fact that it was sort of premeditated which that's not the right word that [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4298.74s)]
*  Premeditated sounds too nefarious. No, no, no [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4303.599999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying whenever money is made at this quantum and at that scale [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4308.179999999999s)]
*  Everybody wants a piece because they know that that's their one shot. So [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4312.82s)]
*  I just think that it'll amplify the pressure [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4317.139999999999s)]
*  For actors inside of those organizations to take their shot and that's just going to be [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4320.0199999999995s)]
*  Financially the right thing to do for a lot of people if if what you're saying is true [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4326.5s)]
*  We know the investments have been made under a cap return model. I think that's fact. That's fact [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4330.5s)]
*  Yes, we know the non-profit foundation owns the shares. That's fact and then just to put the 800 pound gorilla on the table like [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4334.34s)]
*  What's elon thinking because he was the one that really got this thing off the ground because that critical investment made the whole thing [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4341.22s)]
*  Come to life he could have done this on his own [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4346.82s)]
*  Yeah, how much does he own? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4349.38s)]
*  Hmm zero zero [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4351.38s)]
*  I mean, but after a lawsuit, how much does he own? I don't know [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4353.38s)]
*  I'm just speculating. Can we talk about the technology? Yes. I'll tear it up for you. Here we go [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4357.86s)]
*  So open AI released some new chat cheap and t features. The key point here is they're doing what's called [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4361.54s)]
*  Multi modal multi modal is the big innovation. What does that mean? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4366.74s)]
*  That means the input could be voice the input could be code the input could be data [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4370.98s)]
*  It could be a picture. Here's a picture if you're watching along on the youtube channel do a search for all in podcast on youtube hit subscribe hit the bell [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4374.98s)]
*  And it's a classic picture of one of those no parking signs where there's four different ones you take a picture of that [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4381.78s)]
*  That's the input and you say it's wednesday at 4 p.m [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4386.74s)]
*  Can I park in the spot right now? Tell me in one line. It comes back and says yes [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4389.459999999999s)]
*  You can park for up to one hour starting at 4 p.m [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4393.139999999999s)]
*  What this means is the output or the input could be in any of those modalities modalities fancy word for an image a video, etc [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4395.459999999999s)]
*  So you're going to be able to say hey give me the poster for the all-in conference [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4403.3s)]
*  Of bestie runner and I want it to be these things and here are the pictures of the boys and then make it and go back [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4407.46s)]
*  And forth and back and forth and this is really groundbreaking at the same time [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4413.22s)]
*  Last week google bard and send deep madra and I played with this on this week in startups [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4418.820000000001s)]
*  You now have google flights google docs gmail and a number of the other core google services are now available [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4424.900000000001s)]
*  Google services are now in bard. So that's not [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4431.86s)]
*  Multimodal exactly but you could do things like ask google flights. Hey, what is the best non-stop? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4436.719999999999s)]
*  You know between new york city and dubai [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4444.42s)]
*  Or from an east coast destination that has lay down flat seats, etc [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4447.7s)]
*  And it really does it's starting to work. So this idea that google is going to be displaced or they're moving slow [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4451.219999999999s)]
*  That might be antiquated information [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4457.3s)]
*  So those are the two big big monumental announcements just in the last 10 days freeburg [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4459.38s)]
*  When you look at these two, which one is the more important announcement? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4465.0599999999995s)]
*  And and what do you think about the pace because we here we are [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4468.66s)]
*  We're about to hit the one-year anniversary of chad gpt 3.5. I've been using [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4470.9s)]
*  A lot of different tools the last couple of months and i'm [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4476.82s)]
*  kind of [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4480.18s)]
*  Getting to the point that I feel [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4481.54s)]
*  That much of what's happening is underhyped rather than overhyped [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4483.94s)]
*  There's some really incredible potential emerging [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4487.94s)]
*  Um, i'll give a couple of examples and then i'll talk about the mobile phone [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4491.46s)]
*  First is uh, andre [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4495.38s)]
*  Uh carpati as you guys see in the tweet that I just posted in the chat [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4497.14s)]
*  Made a point today [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4501.14s)]
*  That llm's are emerging not just as a chat bot but as a kernel process meaning a new type of operating system [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4502.82s)]
*  That can do input and output across different modalities can interpret code [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4510.0199999999995s)]
*  Can access the internet and information and then can render things in a visual way [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4513.94s)]
*  Or in an audio way that the user wants to consume it [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4518.74s)]
*  So as a result llm's become the core driver to a new type of computing interface [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4522.0199999999995s)]
*  There was a paper published and i'll uh share the link to this paper here as well [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4527.38s)]
*  And we can put it in the notes. It's not worth pulling up on the screen [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4530.9s)]
*  That showed that using llm's [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4534.26s)]
*  In autonomous driving can actually significantly improve the performance of the [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4536.58s)]
*  Neural nets that the autonomous cars are trained on so the autonomous car is typically trained on a bunch of [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4542.42s)]
*  Sensor data that comes in and then that sensor data determines what sort of action to take with the car [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4547.3s)]
*  And what this team showed is that if you actually put in a communication layer that thinks and talks like a human [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4553.14s)]
*  In between the sensor data and the action data it can do really wide-ranging interpretations of the data [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4558.9800000000005s)]
*  That otherwise would not be apparent from the data set it was trained on [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4564.74s)]
*  So for example, you can see a person down the road and ask it [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4568.5s)]
*  What do you think that person's going to do next and the llm because it's trained on a much larger corpus of data [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4571.86s)]
*  Than just sensor data from cars it can make a really good human-like interpretation of that [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4577.62s)]
*  Feed that decision back into the control system of the car and have the car do something more intelligently [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4582.82s)]
*  That it otherwise would have been able to do so these llm's are becoming a lot more like a software [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4588.5s)]
*  Operating system and you can kind of extend that into mobile phones mobile phones originally were just voice [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4593.78s)]
*  And then they were single lines of text in the form of sms [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4599.38s)]
*  Then you were able to browse the web and then the app revolution came about where all of this information emerged through apps [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4602.259999999999s)]
*  What llm's now allow perhaps is that the entire operating system of the phone? [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4607.86s)]
*  Can run and render any sort of application or any sort of service or product you might want to use on the fly? [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4612.58s)]
*  In stream so the input to the phone can be voice it can be visual it can be video [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4619.3s)]
*  And the output can be rendered by perhaps a bunch of what might otherwise be called apps [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4624.18s)]
*  But call it third-party developers that build in stream [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4628.1s)]
*  Into that chat that no longer looks like a chat interface like we see on chat gbt [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4631.38s)]
*  But can be rendered visually can be rendered with audio can be rendered a bunch of different ways [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4635.3s)]
*  So if mobile really is the dominant tech hardware platform that humans are using [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4639.860000000001s)]
*  For computing today llm's and these sorts of tools can become the dominant operating system on that hardware [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4644.9800000000005s)]
*  And you can totally rethink the modality of how you use computing through applications today [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4650.66s)]
*  We have an app store and we download apps and use them and that all becomes in stream [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4655.14s)]
*  In an llm or chat type interface that can be accessed in a bunch of different ways [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4659.06s)]
*  So for me, there's a really bigger thing that's happening [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4663.06s)]
*  That's not just about making smarter tools and increasing productivity, but a real revolution in computing itself [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4665.78s)]
*  That seems to be emergent and I think carpati's tweet this morning some of the stuff [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4672.34s)]
*  I've been playing with some of the papers i've been reading and some of the speculation around a mobile hardware start to support that thesis [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4676.26s)]
*  And I think it's going to be really significant. It's a wholesale rewriting of computing computing interfaces human computer interaction [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4681.94s)]
*  That's going to rethink everything and it seems to be [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4688.34s)]
*  Um pretty substantial and just using a bunch of tools myself. I'm blown away every single time [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4691.0599999999995s)]
*  With what you can do. Yeah, I mean right now I would agree with you strongly agree because [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4696.099999999999s)]
*  This was some this was magic links [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4701.78s)]
*  Vision for the future, which is you would talk to agents as they called them [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4704.9s)]
*  This was a a company that existed in the 90s before smartphones existed [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4708.34s)]
*  It was a physical device sony made the device [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4712.099999999999s)]
*  And the operating system the concept was you would say i'm looking for a flight to go to this place [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4714.58s)]
*  The agent would go out it would do a bunch of work and then come back to you with the options [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4718.98s)]
*  so [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4723.139999999999s)]
*  Not just a google search coming back with ten blue links [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4723.94s)]
*  But actually just solving your problem and if the interface is from general magic, right general magic [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4726.42s)]
*  Right. Yeah, right, right and there's a movie general magic the movie you can look at the wikipedia [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4731.94s)]
*  Company, but this was a lot of like the early work in this area [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4737.46s)]
*  And uh, I think this is going to become the interface and lms talking to each other [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4740.9s)]
*  Then the question becomes who owns this how many of these are there are they verticalized? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4744.5s)]
*  So what do you think the game on the field is here? Uh sec? [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4749.38s)]
*  Well, I I think this is super interesting [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4753.94s)]
*  I don't know if this qualifies as a science corner, but this is the most interesting science corner you've ever done at a minimum [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4756.34s)]
*  It's a nerd corner. Yeah, it's a nerd corner science corner into an intersecting realm so we can all be involved [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4760.58s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how we crowbar and uranus joke into this but let's let's keep our eyes wide open here [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4766.18s)]
*  Okay, so on the phone, I think what's interesting there just to boil it down is you're talking about replacing [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4772.82s)]
*  The main interface which is currently a wall of apps, right? [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4778.82s)]
*  And you push you tap an app to go into the app and then you interact with it [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4782.58s)]
*  You're talking about replacing all that with basically voice [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4787.0599999999995s)]
*  So imagine a serial. Yeah, more visual if you connect like glasses to it or something [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4790.02s)]
*  So that the phone rather than double click on an app [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4795.46s)]
*  The app developers as they're called today are basically building in-screen utilities that are part of the chat interface [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4799.14s)]
*  That that is the phone itself and that's what's going to be so compelling [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4806.02s)]
*  You have to read like we used to write websites and we wrote apps and now we're going to write these kind of in-stream [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4809.38s)]
*  Services these plugins alexa was going to do this. Yeah [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4814.26s)]
*  Well, alexa or syria, but syria kind of sucks it just doesn't work that well doesn't work [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4818.099999999999s)]
*  But imagine if the phone perfectly understood what you were saying [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4823.0599999999995s)]
*  Then you would just say call me an uber order me food whatever and precisely you would just instruct it [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4826.66s)]
*  It's like in that movie [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4832.179999999999s)]
*  Was it her her the walkie and phoenix movie god that should have been my background today [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4833.86s)]
*  What am I thinking? You've disappointed all the science corner fans. I think it's a spike jones movie [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4838.26s)]
*  He did a really good job with that man. That one that movie is looking more and more great [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4842.82s)]
*  Like it's gonna happen we got to do a rewatchable on that [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4846.42s)]
*  Yeah [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4848.9800000000005s)]
*  We should rewatch it you won't even really need the pane of glass if you can just talk to it with an earpiece now [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4849.14s)]
*  I think you're right that the phone needs to know what you're looking at or it can do so much more [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4854.820000000001s)]
*  If it has all those senses [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4860.42s)]
*  That's part of the multimodal demo that that opening I showed this week is it has video and it has camera [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4862.5s)]
*  integration [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4868.72s)]
*  and [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4869.9400000000005s)]
*  Remember in human computer interaction [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4870.66s)]
*  It's often a lot easier for a human to interact with a visual representation of stuff on a screen than to hear stuff [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4873.0599999999995s)]
*  In audio so we we will still need some sort of visual display whether it's a screen [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4880.099999999999s)]
*  Or an eyeglass or something that shows us a bunch of information in a way sam apparently [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4885.22s)]
*  Talk about the ecosystem. He's trying to create [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4890.98s)]
*  sam apparently invested in a company that was hardware plus software for [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4893.7s)]
*  Like journaling like you would hang like a necklace around your neck a camera type device wearable wearable [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4898.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay, and it would record everything and it would be like your memory backup and you'd be able to query it [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4905.38s)]
*  so [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4911.860000000001s)]
*  That was william gibson's plot line in one of his books where he had a little zeppelin that would follow people around [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4912.820000000001s)]
*  Uh and record everything and then you'd have a dvr of your entire life and that would be completely indexed and then you could [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4919.54s)]
*  The ai would know your entire life and be able to advise you [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4925.78s)]
*  Do you guys use the feature on your? [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4928.34s)]
*  AirPods where if you leave them in it will read you the messages from your signal or your incoming notifications where it reads them to you [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4930.82s)]
*  Obviously you don't so there's a new feature on the in the air pods you leave them in [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4939.139999999999s)]
*  And if you're working you're walking around the house or you're walking around manhattan like I am these last couple days [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4943.0599999999995s)]
*  It will stop the podcast i'm listening to and just say [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4948.099999999999s)]
*  You know, oh poker group says this oh, you know your wife just [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4950.820000000001s)]
*  Texted you this and it reads it to you and then you can say reply [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4955.14s)]
*  So eventually if siri works and then you have those apple goggles on [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4958.900000000001s)]
*  I think that that is going to be the eventual interface which is you'll hear certain things. You'll see certain things some things will be [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4963.62s)]
*  Better visually other things will be better. Didn't facebook announce a new pair of glasses today [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4970.34s)]
*  The yeah, those are like they're spectacle kind of things. These are the light ar glasses where you could take pictures [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4975.139999999999s)]
*  Just meant to say everything's converging a lot faster than we all know [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4980.9s)]
*  So I started using a new note-taking app called reflect. Have you guys heard of this? It's reflecting on things. Whoa, this is progress [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4984.42s)]
*  Tell us more [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4992.5s)]
*  I'm just starting to play with it [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4994.26s)]
*  But what it does is you keep like a daily log of who you've met with and what meetings were about [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=4995.3s)]
*  So it's basically a note-taking app, but it does backlinks [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5000.26s)]
*  So that it starts to link together the people on concepts or whatever [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5003.3s)]
*  And so like the use case that I think it's quite useful for once you've been using it for a while [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5006.74s)]
*  Is okay. I mean with this person when's the last time I saw them. What do we talk about then? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5011.54s)]
*  So it gives you like content right? Yeah [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5017.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's awesome. I really like it's external memory right because like I can't i'm like i'm deluge with so much stuff now [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5019.7s)]
*  I can't even [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5025.54s)]
*  Like I forget people's names sometimes if i've only met him once or twice. So his name is free bird david freebird [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5026.74s)]
*  Not you guys, but [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5033.22s)]
*  No, it's also getting old. You're sure [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5035.14s)]
*  I mean, it's a function of how much input is coming at you. There's just so much coming at us today [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5037.62s)]
*  Right, but but just it's having a short log of who i've met with and briefly what the meeting was about [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5042.18s)]
*  So I can go back and check it and at some point in the future [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5047.3s)]
*  I've searched against it [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5050.42s)]
*  But the only problem with it is I do have to like take the time to enter all this stuff and it's kind of a pain [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5051.62s)]
*  It'll just be done automatically like a true external [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5056.18s)]
*  Hard drive to my brain then that would be very powerful authenticate with slack and gmail and do that automatically and then you'll it'll be [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5060.660000000001s)]
*  Otherworldly it already connects with google. I don't want my slack in my reflect [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5068.64s)]
*  What I want is my meetings which they do they integrate with google calendar, right? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5073.620000000001s)]
*  And really that's it [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4spNsmlxWVQ&t=5078.26s)]
