# E171 DOJ sues Apple, AI arms race, Reddit IPO, Realtor settlement & more
**All In Podcast:** [March 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc)
*  Has anybody else seen due to an IMAX? No, don't say anything. Oh, don't say anything about Dune. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to say about Dune. No, don't say it. It is fantastic. And I want to see it again. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=6.0s)]
*  That's all I'm saying is that it's worth seeing. I don't even want to know that you think it's good. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=12.64s)]
*  It's over. It makes me stop. See, he didn't say it. He didn't. Sax didn't see it. No, I saw Dune. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=17.28s)]
*  Dude, too. Yeah, I saw it. It's over. Okay, stop. Stop. Okay, stop. Everybody you both did. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=24.8s)]
*  There's like five great scenes. Sax, the scene. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=31.84s)]
*  All right, everybody. Welcome to the All In Podcast with me again, the chairman dictator, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=55.279999999999994s)]
*  Chamath Pali, hapateeha, David Sax, the rain man. Yeah. And the Sultan of Science, David Freberg, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  teacher boy, J Cal here and we have so much to go through. The DOJ dropped a Sherman X suit on [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=67.84s)]
*  Apple today, right as we were about to tape the program. It seems like Thursday's is the big news [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=76.88s)]
*  drop day now. So this DOJ suit outlines five alleged abuses and they claim obviously that [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=82.64s)]
*  those abuses reduce competition while limiting consumer choice and raising the prices that [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=88.32s)]
*  consumers pay for their iPhone. We talked about this actually just a couple of weeks ago. We talked [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=93.52s)]
*  about peak Apple. The five categories are very quickly super apps, cloud gaming apps, messaging [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=97.28s)]
*  apps, smartwatches and digital wallets. If you don't know about super apps, that's the one that's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  maybe you haven't heard of. If you're listening to this in Asia, they mentioned how Alipay, WeChat [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=109.84s)]
*  and Paytm are super apps. What does that mean? You get like five or six different functions in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  one app, social media, images, purchasing, getting rides, you know, all that stuff. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  And when you have that, you can move from one platform to another super easily. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=126.88s)]
*  And when it comes to messaging apps, we've all experienced the green bubble friend. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  So the main argument of the lawsuit, pretty interesting. They explain and it's a really [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=136.16s)]
*  well written document. I read it this morning that when Apple faces new competition, instead of [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=142.0s)]
*  lowering prices for consumers or offering a better deal to developers, they would quote, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=147.28s)]
*  meet competitive threats by imposing a series of shape shifting rules and restrictions in its app [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=153.44s)]
*  store guidelines and developer agreements. I've faced this every time I've invested in an app [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=158.24s)]
*  startup, they complain about the goalposts moving by Apple and Apple shares down about 3% on the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=163.92s)]
*  news today. I'm sure everybody's got some interesting thoughts on it. Chamath, you were talking about [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=170.32s)]
*  peak Apple just last week or the week before, I think. What are your thoughts on the lawsuit [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=175.27999999999997s)]
*  that dropped today? To be honest, I haven't read it and I don't really know [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=181.27999999999997s)]
*  like the odds of these things just because it seems like some of this stuff is so clearly political. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=185.92s)]
*  And I think that these things have seasons to it in the sense that there are moments where these [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  things are more likely to go in the favor of the company and more likely to go in favor of the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  government. The one thing I'll say is that these guys have been losing a fair number of these things. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=200.64s)]
*  So they're kind of 50-50 in their fight with Epic. They've basically lost against their fight with [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=209.12s)]
*  Spotify. They definitely are in a moment where people are looking at the profitability of these [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=214.72s)]
*  devices as the source of their long-term cash flow. And I think they realize that there's not a lot of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  growth because they haven't entered a bunch of new markets. And I think that's a good thing. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=230.8s)]
*  So the real question is knowing all of that, did they do something beyond what they've already [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=235.52s)]
*  always done to try to lock people in and can they prove it? I think that that's really where the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=240.8s)]
*  government's case will come down to because then it's clear that Apple probably understood that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=246.24s)]
*  their market was kind of solidifying and they introduced these blocks essentially into processes [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  that force people to stay. That's probably bad news for them. But I don't know if they're [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=259.68s)]
*  really going to do something beyond that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=263.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=265.68s)]
*  Sacks, did you get a chance to read it or do you have any thoughts, generally speaking? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=266.48s)]
*  I haven't read the filings, but I read some of the press coverage about it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=271.36s)]
*  I would say based on the press coverage that I read that there's not really a smoking gun here. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=274.96s)]
*  At least the press hasn't reported one. And what I mean by that is, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=280.88s)]
*  let me give you a couple of examples that were in the press. One is that apparently the filing [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  made a point about when Tim Cook was confronted some time ago by a user saying, when I try to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=290.64s)]
*  send a video by text to someone with an Android phone, it just doesn't work very well. It never [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=297.84s)]
*  works. It was a guy trying to send a video to his mom and Tim Cook responded, well, your mom should [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=302.4s)]
*  buy an iPhone. It's kind of like a throwaway comment by Tim Cook. Probably not a great idea [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  for him to say that, but that's an example of what the lawsuit brings up. Another example is that the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=311.68s)]
*  Apple Watch doesn't work with Android phones. It only works with iPhones, obviously. Again, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=316.88s)]
*  is that really a smoking gun issue? I don't think so. This is Apple's whole strategy is that all of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=325.76s)]
*  its products work seamlessly together and Apple hardware doesn't really work with other operating [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=332.88s)]
*  systems. It never has. So at least based on the press coverage, I have yet to see a single smoking [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=338.48s)]
*  gun example coming out of this lawsuit. Now, I think what those examples highlight is what this [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=345.36s)]
*  lawsuit is really about is your view of interoperability. What the government is saying [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=350.24s)]
*  is that Apple needs to make its apps and its devices more interoperable with other ecosystems. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=356.88s)]
*  So the watch needs to be interoperable with Android. Apple messaging needs to be interoperable [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=364.56s)]
*  with Android messaging and so on. What the government is saying is that Apple is refusing [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=370.96s)]
*  to play ball with other applications, other operating systems, and that creates a monopolistic [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=375.52s)]
*  network effect. What I think Apple would say is no, the fact is that Apple from the outset has always [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=381.68s)]
*  tried to do everything soup to nuts. We've always done the hardware and the software together, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=388.0s)]
*  and that's what creates the magical experience. And so Apple's entire product strategy is based [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=394.0s)]
*  on creating a vertically integrated stack that goes from hardware to operating system [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=399.76s)]
*  to key applications. And I think Apple has a point saying if you try to make us unwind all of that, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=406.71999999999997s)]
*  the process is not going to work as well. It's not going to be the same product experience that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=412.64s)]
*  everyone's used to. So again, I think that how you view interoperability is at the core of this [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=416.0s)]
*  lawsuit. I think that both the government and Apple make good points about that. And I'm a [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=421.12s)]
*  little bit skeptical right now that the government has a smoking gun. At least one hasn't been [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=427.28s)]
*  reported in the press. And so I'm a little bit doubtful right now that the government's going [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=432.32s)]
*  to be able to win this case. Freeberg, any thoughts? Yeah, I mean, I think it's a function of [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=437.35999999999996s)]
*  consumer choice. If consumers want to have this closed system where they can iMessage with other [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=442.23999999999995s)]
*  iMessage app holders and not be able to have a seamless integrated messaging experience with [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=448.88s)]
*  Android users, they'll be happy. If they're annoyed, they'll switch over to an Android. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=454.8s)]
*  So this has always been Apple's orientation. I think I mentioned this to you guys. I've been [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=460.08s)]
*  on a Mac since 1984 when the Mac original came out. I still have my first Mac original, by the way. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  I keep it in my office on my shelf. And Apple's always had a really hard focus on the software [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=471.76s)]
*  that they make available to their users to create an incredible product experience. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=479.92s)]
*  I don't know if this is necessarily about market abuse as much as it is a consumer choice. If the [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  consumers didn't like the product, they didn't like the fact that things were not available, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=490.32s)]
*  that things were very expensive, they would go elsewhere. And you do see that in segments [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=494.48s)]
*  of the market. And as we talked about a few weeks ago, you do see that ex-US. Most of the smartphone [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=498.48s)]
*  market is actually Android driven. So this is a premium product that people are willing to pay a [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=504.24s)]
*  premium price for, even if that means limited access. I think developers are frustrated that [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=509.12s)]
*  they can't access this premium market. But I'm not sure that Apple necessarily should be coerced [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=512.72s)]
*  to service developers when at the end of the day, the consumers are paying for the products. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=520.48s)]
*  And to your point, is it really the case that a green bubble versus a blue bubble is really [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=525.28s)]
*  that limiting? It's annoying, but not super limiting. I would say Apple has completely [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=530.1600000000001s)]
*  abused their power every chance they get in order to capture this 30% from the app store. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=538.24s)]
*  They blocked the ability for you to use Audible or other marketplaces to buy books and media. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=543.52s)]
*  They blocked the ability to use other media players like VLC, blocked the ability to use [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=551.04s)]
*  browsers. And if you leave Apple unchecked, they just keep abusing it. And so I think this is one [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=556.4s)]
*  of those lawsuits that's like, if we don't stop them, they'll just keep making it worse. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=563.04s)]
*  And when people file complaints, then Apple will back down, which they did on media players. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=567.76s)]
*  And they'll stand down. If you think about this from the PC era to now, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=573.92s)]
*  then you can see how pernicious their behavior is. When you buy a laptop, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=578.4s)]
*  the idea that you would have to go through an app store and pay a $30 tax to put a piece of [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=582.4s)]
*  software on your computer would seem insane. 30% tax on your, which would seem insane. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=587.04s)]
*  Like if you buy a laptop, you should be able to put whatever software you want on it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=593.8399999999999s)]
*  But they did this magic trick where they said, oh no, if you want to put software on your phone, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=597.36s)]
*  it has to go through the app store. It has to be 30%. And that's really the anti-competitive thing [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=601.92s)]
*  here. I think this will be settled. And if you look at the different issues here, I think this [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=606.48s)]
*  is going to be actually a huge win for Apple because if iMessage were to exist on Android, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=611.68s)]
*  they would get all of those users to download iMessage and they would have all those users. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=617.28s)]
*  If they made the watch compatible, they would open up many more people to buy the watch [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=621.52s)]
*  and you would get more watches. I think that Apple's thinking way too short term about [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=625.28s)]
*  the lock in here and they should allow more of these apps, allow more watches and they should [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  allow the gaming thing. I think that they're being petty. I don't think anything's going to [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=634.64s)]
*  happen here because it's taken them five years to file. There's at least a 50% chance that the [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=638.88s)]
*  administration is going to turn over, which means that this lawsuit changes or goes away entirely. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=646.4s)]
*  And then even if it does kind of proceed, it's going to take 10 years of very detailed arguments [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=651.84s)]
*  for something to happen. And frankly, probably in 10 years from now, we've already moved to [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=656.64s)]
*  a different compute platform and this is not going to matter. I mean, there is the coin toss [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=660.96s)]
*  of what the Trump administration would do here. For sure that's valid, but I think these things [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=665.68s)]
*  won't get settled. I think the settlement will be iMessage releases. They allow the thing about the [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=670.2399999999999s)]
*  Apple watch. It's not just sacks that they're allowing it on Android. It's would you allow [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=675.5999999999999s)]
*  Android watches to connect with the SDK directly into the iOS operating system, which they block [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=679.92s)]
*  you from doing. I think they should just have a little switch in your Friedberg settings that [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=686.8s)]
*  allows you to flip it and say, I take responsibility for allowing third party stores [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=692.4s)]
*  and I want to be able to load any software. It's your computer. I don't think the government should [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=698.48s)]
*  regulate that. I don't think the government should be able to mandate. I think they, yeah. I mean, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=703.28s)]
*  I like the fact that everyone is looking to the government to do things that they want as a [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=707.04s)]
*  consumer. Make your choice with your dollars, make your vote with the product and service you want to [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=711.6s)]
*  buy instead of running to the government and asking the government to come and do stuff. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=716.0799999999999s)]
*  Do you feel that way about price fixing? What do you mean price fixing? In what context? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=719.84s)]
*  If like a group of people price fix the price cost of a phone or like, let's say the 30% from [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=723.52s)]
*  the app store, which just happens to be the same between two app stores. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=729.0400000000001s)]
*  Do you think price fixing is something valid for the government to come in on? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=732.88s)]
*  It's not the same. Do you think price fixing is something the government should come in on [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=735.84s)]
*  is the question. If there's limited access to products in a market and all the participants [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=739.2800000000001s)]
*  get together to set the price in the market, I do think that's anti-competitive and that's, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=744.1600000000001s)]
*  there's a good role for the government to play there. But Google and Apple don't price fix [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=749.04s)]
*  because Android is an open access system. You can put any application you want, any way you want. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=754.0799999999999s)]
*  There are several app stores to put Android apps on your Android device. Google operates an app [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=759.04s)]
*  store called Google Play, but there are other app stores you can go to as well. And they all have [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=765.28s)]
*  different prices and Google's app store costs, by the way, are not Apple's and they're not 30%. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=769.76s)]
*  And we talked about this last time. I'll pull it up for you again. It's like 15 to 12 going down. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=774.4s)]
*  It's a sliding scale. So there is competition in that market. Generally, I think the point about [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=778.16s)]
*  if there's limited access to a market for products for consumers and everyone in that [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=783.8399999999999s)]
*  market gets together and sets a price, that is anti-competitive and there's a good role [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=787.92s)]
*  for government to play there. But I don't think that having the government come in and say, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=791.76s)]
*  I want this feature to have this button and this flip in my app is what I want my government doing. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=794.9599999999999s)]
*  I want my government protecting me from crime and defending the country. And I don't want all the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=800.64s)]
*  other stuff that the government does to drive costs up, which is generally what the government [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=806.88s)]
*  does. So what do you think the role of the government is here in terms of anti-competitiveness, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=810.4s)]
*  especially in the case, I'm curious your thoughts on a duopoly. Like if you look at Google search [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=815.6s)]
*  monopoly, pretty easy to understand, like, hey, they've got 90%. But here you got two players who [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=819.4399999999999s)]
*  have roughly 50% of the market each or 60, 40, depending on where you are. So what is the [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=824.72s)]
*  proper role of government here? And is this an overreach? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=831.2s)]
*  No, I mean, I actually think just to give the government lawsuits some credit, I actually think [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=834.0799999999999s)]
*  it's good to hold Apple's feet to the fire and make sure they're not engaging in anti-competitive [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=838.7199999999999s)]
*  tactics. One of the things I've said previously on the show is that I think the government's been [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=843.1999999999999s)]
*  making the mistake of going after bigness for its own sake. And I don't think that bigness in and of [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=848.56s)]
*  itself is bad. It might be a reflection that the company's done an incredibly good job. And that's [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=853.92s)]
*  why it has a lot of customers and a lot of market share. What I've said is I think the [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=860.0s)]
*  government should prevent anti-competitive tactics. So I think that this lawsuit is good in the sense [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=864.24s)]
*  that it's targeted at the right types of things. It's not just going after Apple because its market [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=869.28s)]
*  cap is so big, it's going after specific things that it's doing to kind of lock in its network [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=874.9599999999999s)]
*  effect. Now, the problem that I see is just that the examples that we've been given so far from [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=880.0799999999999s)]
*  the lawsuit just don't seem that compelling. Again, I'm kind of waiting to find out where's [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=885.04s)]
*  the smoking gun here. But to Freeberg's point, I mean, look, I don't think you can just say that [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=889.92s)]
*  if you don't like what Apple is doing, go to a different platform. Because the point is that [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=896.64s)]
*  there's only two choices. And they can both engage in anti-competitive tactics and they can both [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=900.48s)]
*  create lock-in. But, Sachs, there are not just two choices. Android is an open operating system. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=906.9599999999999s)]
*  Google has a fork of Android that they put on certain smartphones. There are other smartphone [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=912.48s)]
*  makers that use other forks of Android. So Android has enabled and the reason Google bought Android [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=917.36s)]
*  was to provide a counterbalance to exactly the dynamic of one handset manufacturer having an [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=923.84s)]
*  operating system that could control access to the internet and to apps. And so Google open-sourced [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=930.0s)]
*  Android. Many handset manufacturers use their own versions of Android to put their own experience [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=935.28s)]
*  on the phone. And then Android users can put apps from anywhere they want. And other companies [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=940.72s)]
*  offer app stores. So there are many app stores to go to and there are many different handset [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=946.1600000000001s)]
*  manufacturers. And a lot of people, I think, incorrectly look at the operating system landscape [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=950.24s)]
*  in mobile and say, oh, there's Android and there's iOS. But Android is an open platform and there are [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=955.84s)]
*  many different forks of it run by many different companies. So I think that it is actually a very [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=960.96s)]
*  competitive market. Like we talked about last week, I think close to 80% of global handsets [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=965.44s)]
*  are run on Android forks. So it's not necessarily the case that there are only two choices. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=970.0s)]
*  And Google does not control Android. There are many developers that contribute to open-source [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=975.68s)]
*  there. Google has their own fork that they do a lot of work on. But anyone can take their own fork [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=979.76s)]
*  and do it. I mean, you guys can... When you boot up a Samsung or Sony TV, that's running Android. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=984.4s)]
*  And that's running their own version of Android. Are you arguing that Apple doesn't have market [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=990.32s)]
*  power? In the US, they do. XUS, they're... Yeah, I mean, I think, sure, we're talking about the US [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=993.92s)]
*  market. I mean, I think the US market, are they about 50-50? We pulled this chart up last week. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=999.6s)]
*  But I think they're about 50-50. It's slightly more in the US now. It might be 55-45 right now. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1004.24s)]
*  Yeah, something like that. The issue is the cat and mouse that Apple is really good at playing, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1007.44s)]
*  they will push their advantage. And so we see the five things that the Justice Department wants to [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1012.32s)]
*  go after here, but the App Store is obviously one of them. And before that, I mentioned some [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1016.5600000000001s)]
*  of the other categories where they do this abusive power. They basically keep it up as much as they [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1020.88s)]
*  can until they get checked. And I think interoperability is actually in the long [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1025.36s)]
*  term going to be in their best interest. They use interoperability when they need it. So Apple Music [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1030.1599999999999s)]
*  and iTunes, they allow you to use Windows and Android. It's only when they see an advantage. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1035.36s)]
*  And that's really the hypocrisy of Apple. And I think it's really important that the industry [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1040.1599999999999s)]
*  stand for more interoperability and the ability for you to load any software that you want on [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1046.4799999999998s)]
*  your device. This is a compute platform. The ability for them to block you from installing [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1050.8s)]
*  your own apps on it, I think is a really terrible precedent. By the way, Jason, what you're saying [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1055.28s)]
*  is a very fair statement from a consumer point of view and from an industry point of view. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1059.2s)]
*  And that's where that voice should come from, to force in the marketplace changes from Apple. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1064.0s)]
*  But having the government do this and having the government involved, I think sets all these bad [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1069.28s)]
*  patterns. Yeah, they're representing the people. Somebody did it. They asked Tim Cook to do it. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1073.04s)]
*  And Tim Cook said, Pound Salt, buy a phone for your mom. No, but aren't they representing the people? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1075.9199999999998s)]
*  How do you expect the people to organize? File a class action? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1080.64s)]
*  No, I think if enough companies boycott the Apple platform and tell consumers to boycott, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1084.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, consumers can make decisions. Developers can make decisions whether or not they want to [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1088.96s)]
*  develop for Apple. No, that's not realistic. You know that. That's naive. Come on. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1092.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't think I want the government stepping in to tell private companies what to do because [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1096.96s)]
*  customers don't like what they're doing. Wait, wait, wait. Do you think that the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1101.1200000000001s)]
*  government just stepped in to prevent Microsoft from taking over the browser, the whole Netscape [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1104.3200000000002s)]
*  case? Bundling? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1108.48s)]
*  I don't know the case well enough. I mean, I remember it, but I don't want to speak. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1111.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't want to speak definitively. I think there was a substantial [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1115.52s)]
*  chance that if the government didn't step in, that Microsoft would have extended their Windows [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1118.08s)]
*  operating system monopoly. They did have an absolute monopoly. They did have a monopoly on [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1122.56s)]
*  personal compute OS at the time. Well, it wasn't an absolute monopoly. I mean, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1127.04s)]
*  it was clear. You were the one. You were using Macintosh. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1130.24s)]
*  No, that's what I'm saying. At the time, Macintosh was like 5% of the market. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1133.1200000000001s)]
*  It was under 10% at the time. Yeah, it was about 4 or 5% at that time. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1136.88s)]
*  It was a dual-oply. Microsoft was 95% [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1140.3200000000002s)]
*  of the personal computing market. So they did have an absolute monopoly on that market. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1143.1200000000001s)]
*  You had a consumer choice. It wasn't a very good consumer choice, but you still had a consumer [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1146.5600000000002s)]
*  choice. You could go use Macintosh. And you did. You were using Macintosh. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1150.4s)]
*  I don't think a lot of people could afford it. Yeah. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1153.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay. But the point is that Microsoft had substantial market power. And what they were [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1156.3200000000002s)]
*  in the process of doing was the smart thing from a business standpoint, which is you take your [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1160.24s)]
*  operating system monopoly, you use that to extend into the browser, you kill Netscape, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1165.36s)]
*  you take over with Explorer, you bake Explorer into your Windows operating system. So the two [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1169.84s)]
*  things are basically the same. Then from there, hold on, from there, you leverage your control [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1175.1999999999998s)]
*  of the browser and the home screen to control search. Okay. And so you think about all the [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1180.24s)]
*  dominoes that would have fallen if Microsoft had continued, maybe if Bill Gates had continued [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1185.4399999999998s)]
*  being CEO, and there would have been no Google, there would have been no Yahoo. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1190.56s)]
*  They would have controlled the internet. They would have controlled the internet. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1194.48s)]
*  And they were actively, you left out a big piece of it, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1196.64s)]
*  Sachs, which you'll remember the second I say it, they were trying to break HTML in open standards [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1199.28s)]
*  by creating active X and using all this funky code. And so you have to understand these companies [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1204.24s)]
*  will, if you give them an inch, they'll take the mile. And that's exactly what Apple does [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1210.56s)]
*  consistently. They consistently try to squeeze. I think it's great. Sachs is right. Tactics is [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1216.24s)]
*  the way to go after these companies. These are five recent tactics. I think though the government's [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1221.76s)]
*  going to win changing three of these. And that's when that's a win for me. Yeah. The mobile [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1226.96s)]
*  operators try to do the same at that same time. If you guys remember Verizon singular, they, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1230.56s)]
*  you could only put their apps. If you bought it through their store on their operating system, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1236.8799999999999s)]
*  on the mobile phones that they contracted to have made. So they all had their own custom version [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1242.16s)]
*  of the handset manufacturers, OS, which I'll get. And then they did red share back with the [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1246.96s)]
*  manufacturers. And that's why Android was acquired. It wasn't actually at the time to compete with [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1251.92s)]
*  Apple. Android was acquired to compete with all the mobile phone companies that were trying to [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1256.96s)]
*  block access to the internet and apps. Well, Google wanted to maintain its search monopoly. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1261.28s)]
*  Let's be honest. That's why they bought it. They knew users would be there and they wanted to have [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1265.28s)]
*  the default browser. They didn't want to have the access to the internet blog by the handset [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1270.08s)]
*  manufacturers. And they wanted to be the default search browser in the app, which is what you have [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1274.72s)]
*  to agree to, by the way. So if you want to talk about perniciousness and heavy handedness, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1278.0s)]
*  if you have an Android and you want to use the Android updates from Google, you have to give [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1281.3600000000001s)]
*  the bundle of apps. If you want the updates and support from Google, you can fork it, but then [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1286.8s)]
*  you don't get their support, which then breaks your phone. If you want their version. That's right. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1290.88s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. So they, you know, there's a little cleverness here, I think. So you have two basic [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1295.2s)]
*  ecosystems and mobile. It is a duopoly and both them advantage themselves in ways that [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1300.32s)]
*  grow over time. And I think that if Apple were completely left unchecked, it would figure out [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1306.8799999999999s)]
*  ways to boil the frog and keep extracting more and more value out of downstream applications. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1313.76s)]
*  We're pairing 1600 a phone now. How are we paying 1600 a phone? So look, I think it's, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1319.52s)]
*  I think it's good for the government to hold their feet to the fire. But here's the thing [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1323.76s)]
*  that the government's lacking is again, that example they can point to that's really compelling. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1326.72s)]
*  I mean, with the Microsoft Netscape thing, it was really obvious what they were doing, right? The [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1332.24s)]
*  browser was the gateway to the whole new platform, which was the internet. And if Microsoft could [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1336.32s)]
*  make that a feature of the operating system, their dominance would extend into the new computing [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1342.56s)]
*  platform. But you remember how they did it, Sacks? Apple Watch is just not the same thing. The Apple [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1346.88s)]
*  Watch is kind of an appendage of your phone that most people don't even want. So it's hard to [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1350.8s)]
*  point to something. Do you remember, Sacks, how they were getting the browser built in? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1356.64s)]
*  They were going to the OEMs, the Dells of the world, the HPs, and saying, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1362.0s)]
*  if you want this price for Windows, you have to include the browser on the desktop. It has to [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1366.0s)]
*  load. It has to ask for your credentials, all this stuff. Or you could pay $150 for Windows, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1371.2s)]
*  and if you want it without the browser bundle. So they use this pricing to get the OEMs to bundle [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1376.88s)]
*  it. And that was where... Wasn't that what Google's doing with Android effectively? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1384.32s)]
*  Exactly. It's exactly right. You can have your own version without Google search if you're willing [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1387.76s)]
*  to put up with all these headaches. And maintain an operating system, update the operating system. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1394.8s)]
*  It's exactly what they're doing. So anyway, I think three out of five of these get settled and [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1400.1599999999999s)]
*  it'll be good for consumers. Ultimately, I would not financial advice, but I think that Apple's [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1404.3999999999999s)]
*  going to be able to manage this and buy the stock. I may buy more of the stock. I think that this [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1409.84s)]
*  will be good for them long-term. All right, listen. Going even deeper into Apple and this [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1413.92s)]
*  Google relationship, big questions emerged this week as Bloomberg reported that Apple was speaking [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1420.0s)]
*  to both Google and OpenAI about powering certain AI features on iOS specifically. According to the [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1425.52s)]
*  article, this deal between Apple and Google seems much more likely than the OpenAI one and could [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1432.24s)]
*  happen this year. As you know, we've talked about it on this show before, Google has been the default [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1437.2s)]
*  search engine on iPhone for I think over a decade now and Google pays Apple 20 billion a year. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1442.0s)]
*  That's pure profit for Apple. It's unclear what features they would power with Google Gemini. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1447.92s)]
*  Maybe it's like the search deal and Google Gemini is on there. Maybe it's built in and Apple has [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1454.96s)]
*  been building its own LLM. It's called Ajax. They've been doing some other open source stuff [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1460.4s)]
*  called Magi. What do you think, Chamath? You were talking about this on Twitter. You had a pretty [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1464.88s)]
*  good tweet and a pretty strong position. If Apple is going to use Gemini, what does that say to you [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1470.32s)]
*  about Apple and their view of the future? I think it's them giving up. This is the most [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1476.8s)]
*  consequential new development in technology and compute in probably 20 years, 30 years. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1481.12s)]
*  And so to be spending tens of billions of dollars of R&D and to not have enough allocated to this [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1489.4399999999998s)]
*  so that you have a legitimate path forward to do it yourself, I think is a little inexcusable actually. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1496.8799999999999s)]
*  It's akin to IBM in the 70s going to Microsoft and basically asking them to build the operating [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1504.0s)]
*  system for them. When you're such a dominant company in such a dominant position, but you [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1511.1999999999998s)]
*  abdicate your responsibility to innovate, I think that that's a really bad situation for a company [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1517.12s)]
*  to be in. It was like Yahoo adding Google search, right? And then by the way, on the heels of like [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1524.72s)]
*  turning off cars and losing these antitrust issues in Europe and then being sued by the DOJ here, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1529.44s)]
*  to then be in a licensing discussion with a third party for such a critical technology, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1539.3600000000001s)]
*  I think is just says not very good things about the state of the company. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1543.92s)]
*  Freeberg, your thoughts on this potential deal? We don't know what features this would power. I [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1549.28s)]
*  don't know if it's Siri or it's just image editing or search or an extension of search, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1554.08s)]
*  maybe giving an answer. I have no idea. It seems to me like there's if Apple's doing the right [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1559.36s)]
*  thing, which I'm sure they are, they're probably building their own alternative platform here. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1564.72s)]
*  They realize it's going to take them some time in the interim. They want to have a stop gap. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1569.84s)]
*  And my guess is by going to Google, they're probably going to get paid instead of having [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1573.6s)]
*  to pay someone else for the technology because Google will realize some benefit from [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1577.6s)]
*  getting users over to search results and seeing ads. So Google will probably benefit and pay them [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1584.08s)]
*  instead of them having to go pay someone for access to some technology that consumers might [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1589.4399999999998s)]
*  want access to. Sax, any thoughts here? I'm sure Apple is going to make an investment [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1595.1999999999998s)]
*  in building their own models here. Yeah. I mean, who would look at the launch of Google Gemini [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1599.12s)]
*  and say, I want that. That launch was a total fiasco. Another world company. I think it fits [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1605.4399999999998s)]
*  the Apple philosophy pretty good. How woke would Tim Cook have to be to look at the launch of Gemini [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1612.48s)]
*  and say, oh yeah, I don't see anything wrong there. You got that exactly right. Absolutely. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1617.6s)]
*  I want that. Yeah. Show me the president of the United States. I mean, apparently Tim Cook is the [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1621.92s)]
*  only person on earth who is impressed with the launch of Google Gemini. I mean, I can't believe [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1628.08s)]
*  the story is true. It's just, it can't be true. I'm so excited today to launch Gemini on stage here [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1632.0s)]
*  iOS 27. Oh my God. Can you imagine him on stage doing searches? The story can't be true because [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1639.68s)]
*  it'd be so strategically dumb. Like Jamal said, even if Google Gemini were great, you'd still want [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1646.4s)]
*  to invest in having your own thing because it's such a strategic technology. Why would you ever [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1651.92s)]
*  outsource it to your main competitor? But in this case, you know that Gemini was terrible. It was a [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1657.68s)]
*  fiasco. And so the story makes no sense. I just can't believe it's true. It's probably people [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1662.24s)]
*  knocking on each other's doors. They spent $30 billion last year on R&D, 30 billion. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1667.68s)]
*  Apple to be clear. They spent $30 billion on R&D. What did they spend it on? Catering. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1674.8s)]
*  I mean, you got to think Apple vision is a big piece of that, right? Chips. I guarantee you like [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1682.0800000000002s)]
*  half of that is like the M3, M4 chips. 30 billion, like not a couple crumbs fall out of somebody's [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1688.64s)]
*  pocket. And so there's 50 million allocated to just like, you know, mucking around with llama or [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1694.24s)]
*  mucking around with Mistral. What if they took Project Titan, the car deal, that was 10 billion, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1699.6s)]
*  supposedly they had spent on that. I mean, if they put that towards AI, it would be Microsoft. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1706.16s)]
*  Again, it goes back to the people. I don't think the person in charge of the windshield wipers [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1711.1200000000001s)]
*  for Project Titan is going to be the person that figures out how to land a really killer LLM. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1716.48s)]
*  That's a different skill set. It's not even that expensive. I mean, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1721.28s)]
*  you're right. One's a mechanical engineer, one's a computer scientist. So these are not the same [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1724.72s)]
*  people. They're not fungible that way. I mean, I guess the question here is Apple capable of [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1728.1599999999999s)]
*  building on a culture basis, Friedberg, this type of software. They're a hardware company. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1732.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not hard. You're standing on the shoulders of the whole open source movement. All you have to [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1738.32s)]
*  do, like Jamal said, all you got to do is take the latest Mistral model or- [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1742.08s)]
*  Jump on hugging face and start working. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1746.32s)]
*  I mean, you're not starting from zero because of open source. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1748.88s)]
*  Not only are you not starting from zero, not only do you have the foundational models that are [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1752.24s)]
*  excellent and available in open source, you have probably the most prolific set of training data [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1755.92s)]
*  that has ever been created in the entire world to make these models kick ass. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1760.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. You have all the Apple photos. I wonder if in their terms, see, that's the thing is their [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1764.64s)]
*  terms of service is so privacy based. I wonder if they could even use that information. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1768.8000000000002s)]
*  And I just think, look, at the end of the day, the Apple brand is still exceptional. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1773.44s)]
*  And so if you're given a $10 million a year job at Google versus a $10 million a year job at Meta [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1777.04s)]
*  versus a $10 million a year job at Apple, if you're like one of these killer AI people that get [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1783.6s)]
*  these kinds of offers, I got to presume that Apple gets their fair share of these people. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1790.0s)]
*  Yeah. You would think. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1795.28s)]
*  And even in the worst case, you see Microsoft doing pretty heavy handed deals with companies [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1796.32s)]
*  like OpenAI and just this week with inflection. So it's not as if these deals can't be done. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1802.88s)]
*  Right. And so it just kind of like leaves, I don't know, it's just, it's quizzical to spend [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1809.6000000000001s)]
*  that much money to not necessarily be willing to compete on the human capital, to not necessarily be [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1815.44s)]
*  in the market acquiring these businesses. I don't know. It's just a question mark. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1821.2800000000002s)]
*  Like what's going on over there? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1826.8000000000002s)]
*  Tramoth asks, what's going on over there? We have some inside footage. Nick, you want to play take? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1827.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. What's going on here? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1832.88s)]
*  What are we watching? [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1842.72s)]
*  I hope we didn't keep you waiting. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1850.24s)]
*  Mother nature. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1854.5600000000002s)]
*  Mother nature. Welcome to Apple. How was the weather getting in? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1856.4s)]
*  Oh, she's controlling the weather. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1863.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. They did this couple of, but this reflects their self image. I mean, they release this. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1868.8000000000002s)]
*  They care about the plan. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1873.68s)]
*  No, it's it reflects that they think somehow this is an accurate reflection of the way they do meetings. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1875.44s)]
*  No, I think it was the, no, I think it was the point they were making is they were trying to do [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1881.3600000000001s)]
*  a skit about like how they're doing less packaging and including that that skit was to tell you that [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1885.0400000000002s)]
*  you're not getting a charger in your next iPhone because they, they don't, they want to say it was [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1890.08s)]
*  cringe. I think the intent was, yeah, maybe it was a little cringe, but yeah, I think it was a little [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1894.0s)]
*  cringe, but I do appreciate that they are doing sustainable products and not putting as much stuff [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1900.08s)]
*  in landfills. So I think they should get a lot of credit for that. What I do think about this deal, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1905.6799999999998s)]
*  that's really interesting is it's sort of cementing the Google and the Apple [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1909.1999999999998s)]
*  alliance against Microsoft and Microsoft has big, you know, AI ambition. So this is kind of [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1913.68s)]
*  interesting. If you lock in the duopoly of Google and Apple, and then you lock in Google search [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1920.24s)]
*  monopoly and you start fighting Microsoft, I think that's what we're, I think that's what's [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1925.52s)]
*  probably going on here is they're trying to figure out how do we keep Microsoft away from [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1930.32s)]
*  running away with this. All right, we covered that huge NAR lawsuit back in December and there has [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1935.52s)]
*  been a settlement big news for the national association of realtors. They've agreed to pay [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1940.64s)]
*  $418 million in a settlement last week and a federal jury found that the NAR and several [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1945.76s)]
*  large real estate brokerages conspired to artificially inflate agent commissions. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1952.72s)]
*  The settlement is pretty, pretty big deal. People are freaking out about it. As you know, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1958.16s)]
*  the seller of a home pays the buyer's agent's commission. So you have a buyer and a seller, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1964.08s)]
*  6% fee, typically sometimes it's five, but they split that 3% to the buyer and the seller, but the [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1970.6399999999999s)]
*  seller is paying that 3% to the buyer. Now that can't be listed in the MLS anymore. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1976.6399999999999s)]
*  And that deal cannot be done ahead of time. Buyers are responsible for paying their agents, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1982.0s)]
*  commissions going forward. So if you bought a million dollar house and you were the buyer, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1988.08s)]
*  you would pay 30,000 to your buyer's agent, or you would choose to not have an agent, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1991.76s)]
*  or you would choose to negotiate it. And you have to have a signed contract. This is a crazy, just [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=1997.28s)]
*  shocking shock to the system. According to most people who are in it, I've seen a lot of real [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2005.12s)]
*  estate folks who are saying this is going to be healthy because you have this, you have to have [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2009.44s)]
*  this conversation between the buyer's agent and the buyer, but commissions in the United States [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2013.6s)]
*  are $100 billion a year. And one analyst projected the lawsuit could lead to a 30% reduction in [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2019.68s)]
*  commission payments. And that would eliminate about half of the 1.6 million active NRA members from [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2026.48s)]
*  the industry. You had a lot of feelings on this Friedberg when we talked about it a couple of [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2032.96s)]
*  months ago. What are your thoughts on this settlement? Is anything going to change? Is this [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2036.4s)]
*  as groundbreaking and shocking as people seem to think it is? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2040.8s)]
*  Well, I would take this settlement along with a lot of the developments and advances in AI [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2045.28s)]
*  as being the moment of catalyzing real change in the residential real estate agency industry. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2055.84s)]
*  It's an industry that's been known to have fixed pricing and be very expensive to consumers, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2062.96s)]
*  a real tax on the system. And it's largely been wrapped around this idea of mitigating your [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2070.24s)]
*  liability, reducing risk, servicing the customer. Many of those aspects over the last couple of [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2077.6s)]
*  years have been largely standardized through forms, digitized because so much of this information is [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2084.56s)]
*  no longer going to get paperwork from the courthouse, but a lot of the information sits [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2090.3199999999997s)]
*  digitally and can be accessed in a democratized way. And the fact that so much of the service [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2093.9199999999996s)]
*  and discovery, reading through documents, understanding what they mean and what they say [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2099.04s)]
*  can be automated through AI and LLMs. Much of this is kind of coalescing around what I hope and [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2103.12s)]
*  expect will be a more seamless, automated, direct marketplace for consumers. The challenge is that [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2108.16s)]
*  most consumers put most of their personal net worth into their home. And so it is where most [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2116.16s)]
*  people's net worth is tied up. And so because it is such a sensitive investment and it is their [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2122.32s)]
*  entire savings, they want to have a trusted advisor by them. So it's going to take some time [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2126.8s)]
*  before that trusted advisor becomes some piece of software. But I do think that software is going [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2133.44s)]
*  to play more and more of a role in providing advisory tools and services to consumers in this [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2138.48s)]
*  transaction marketplace. And that's only going to catalyze and accelerate the fee reduction. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2143.6000000000004s)]
*  I do project and I do expect that much of what is charged on a commission basis, on a percent of [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2150.4s)]
*  home value today will change to being a fixed fee and a flat fee basis. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2155.44s)]
*  5K, 10K for your buyer's age. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2159.44s)]
*  Different services. So you can have someone do the disclosure diligence for me for 5K. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2161.04s)]
*  Negotiate the purchase for me for 10K. And you as a consumer will start to pick from a menu [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2167.68s)]
*  of the services that you want to have rendered for you and things that you're comfortable [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2173.2000000000003s)]
*  doing yourself. I don't need someone to negotiate price. I don't need someone to find me a home. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2176.2400000000002s)]
*  I've got Redfin. I can go do that. I can arrange open houses on my own. The lockbox is there. I'll [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2180.64s)]
*  walk around the property. I don't need someone to point out that the color is nice in a room. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2185.04s)]
*  And so I think that there's elements of what will happen here, which is a fragmentation [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2189.12s)]
*  and then an automation of these services. And as a result, significant fee reduction. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2194.0s)]
*  And I'm in the middle of doing this myself right now with a piece of real estate where I'm not [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2198.96s)]
*  using an agent. And I've been using a direct listing service. I've used all of these standard [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2203.68s)]
*  forms. There's a lot of AI tools you can use to read all the disclosures for you, make sure [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2210.56s)]
*  everything's copacetic. And these escrow agents, they'll handle a lot of what a lawyer will handle [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2214.64s)]
*  and they'll get paid a fee, which is much less than the agent's fee. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2220.08s)]
*  So I do think that there's a big disruption happening in this industry. I think it's really [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2224.16s)]
*  important for consumers. Agents are going to be hands in the air telling you this is ridiculous. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2228.3199999999997s)]
*  You need someone to help you. You need an advisor. That will continue for a good chunk of the market [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2232.48s)]
*  for a very long period of time. But I do think that it's for the benefit of consumers over time [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2236.0s)]
*  to see these fees come out of the system and see those savings go back into consumers pockets [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2240.96s)]
*  and for the value of their real estate to go to go in their pockets, not into an agent's pocket. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2245.76s)]
*  Is it going to change the [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2250.48s)]
*  profitability of a realtor pretty meaningfully, right? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2255.04s)]
*  Both realtors won't be able to be in business. Right. I think the sellers will do fine and [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2258.64s)]
*  they might capture more of it because they'll, they'll, my understanding is the set the, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2262.56s)]
*  the seller will maybe do both sides of the transaction. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2267.6s)]
*  No, that's not what's going to happen. And there's also going to be limits on that. But, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2271.2799999999997s)]
*  but here's what I will say. If you look at the, the, the number of people, there are 1.4 million [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2274.4s)]
*  members of NAR today and the national association of realtors. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2282.16s)]
*  If you look at the distribution of earnings, you guys know this, my guess is probably 10% of those [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2285.92s)]
*  realtors make 40% of the fee income or 50% of the fee income. So there's a long tail. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2292.24s)]
*  So there's probably a third of those folks who are already kind of sub living standards in terms of [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2298.24s)]
*  income. Maybe half of them won't be able to make enough money in this new fee regime that it'll [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2305.04s)]
*  no longer be an attractive proposition to be a real estate agent for maybe half a million to a [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2311.68s)]
*  million people over time that are agents today. Yeah. You know, it's interesting this, the, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2316.96s)]
*  the sellers are going to be faced with buyers who just show up having seen something on Redfin and [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2323.76s)]
*  don't have a buyer's representation. And so they think from the stuff I've been reading that the [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2329.04s)]
*  sellers agent might be pointing them to, Hey, go to these services and be acting as like one broker [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2334.2400000000002s)]
*  essentially representing both sides. That's what people are saying is the potential downside. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2342.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't think that's gonna happen for a couple of reasons, but let me ask you guys a question. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2346.64s)]
*  If you guys wanted to go buy a new house, currently you just go, you know, sign up an agent or buyer's [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2351.68s)]
*  agent and they go walk with you and eventually they'll get paid by the seller's agent. So now [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2357.7599999999998s)]
*  you have to negotiate a fee with them upfront. Would you negotiate a fee and say to a buyer's [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2361.7599999999998s)]
*  agent, Hey, I'll pay you 2% of whatever home I buy. Would you be comfortable doing that or 3% or 4%? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2366.56s)]
*  How would you have that conversation? What would you say, Saks? I mean, forget, I know you've got a [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2372.8s)]
*  different situation because you've got real estate people like working for you, but like if you were [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2377.2000000000003s)]
*  to go out and get, would you go out and get an agent and pay and negotiate a fee with them? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2382.1600000000003s)]
*  It is not worth it to the buyer to pay 2% to 3% of the purchase price to make appointments. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2386.48s)]
*  You can see all the houses on MLS through Zillow or Redfin or whatever. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2392.1600000000003s)]
*  And what about handling closing and disclosures? [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2396.4s)]
*  No buyer would ever voluntarily agree to pay this massive commission. It's not worth it. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2398.4s)]
*  So it's game over for the realtors if buyers are forced to pay their own [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2404.48s)]
*  broker's commission. The only reason this system works is because the seller is forced to pay for [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2411.76s)]
*  it. And when you sign the listing agreement with the seller's agent, you can negotiate a little bit [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2416.88s)]
*  at the margins. Sometimes you can get the 6% down to 4% to 5% for a big listing, but 50% of it will [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2423.2s)]
*  always go to the buy side. I mean, I've said to these guys, the buy side agent doesn't do anything. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2430.48s)]
*  Why don't you make it 2% for yourself and 1% for the buyer? They won't do that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2434.3999999999996s)]
*  They just won't take your business. The seller will not represent you. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2438.64s)]
*  They have like all sorts of rules against it. So the whole thing is like, it's like a racket [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2441.68s)]
*  that's protected. And now it's been cracked. Well, I still am like a little bit skeptical [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2446.3199999999997s)]
*  that this is going to work out exactly the way we're saying because it is just such a [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2451.36s)]
*  death blow to the industry if buyers are forced to pay their own commissions, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2456.7200000000003s)]
*  their own buy side broker's commission. And in the articles, they're saying there's still like [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2460.88s)]
*  some gray area about what's going to happen, but that is what should happen. Buyers should be [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2465.76s)]
*  responsible for paying their own brokers. And if you do that, I think you'll knock out half the fees [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2470.88s)]
*  of this industry. Here's an idea. Why don't you charge an hourly fee as a buyer's agent? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2475.2000000000003s)]
*  There will be people doing that, J. Cal. $200 an hour, $300 an hour. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2479.2s)]
*  Doesn't this impact home prices as well? Like if the buyer had to pay, all of a sudden, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2482.3199999999997s)]
*  their affordability effectively goes down because if they have to pay an extra $100,000 for a home, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2487.2s)]
*  then that's $100,000 less than they can pay for the house itself because they have to pay an agent. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2493.6s)]
*  So it all comes back into home prices, no? It nets out because the seller's agent's [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2499.2799999999997s)]
*  no longer paying 6%. They're paying 3%. And so now the seller's agent has 3% more that... [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2503.36s)]
*  So you're netting. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2510.1600000000003s)]
*  They'll take it. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2512.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. But net-net... [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2513.04s)]
*  I think it's good for buyers and sellers because the transaction costs of trading go down. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2514.1600000000003s)]
*  Exactly. The money goes back in consumers' pockets. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2518.1600000000003s)]
*  It can create a more fluid market. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2520.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2522.08s)]
*  I think it's a great opportunity for startups, I'll say this right now. I think there's going [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2522.48s)]
*  to be a lot of startups that are going to come out of this ruling, that are going to launch [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2526.0s)]
*  a la carte services, leveraging AI to make these services available direct to consumers [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2530.24s)]
*  without needing an agent. And they're going to be pretty compelling services and they're [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2534.9599999999996s)]
*  going to show up real fast. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2538.16s)]
*  I mean, a lot of people will not list their home or sell it because that 6% [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2539.3599999999997s)]
*  might put them underwater. So if it's down now down to two or three... [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2545.4399999999996s)]
*  Totally. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2548.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. People might be like, you know... [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2549.6s)]
*  It's always been crazy to me that anyone would pay a percent of absolute value. It makes no sense. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2550.56s)]
*  I bought a home for a million. I'm selling it for a million one. So I've made $100,000 profit, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2556.16s)]
*  but I got to pay $60,000 of my total gross to an agent to sell it for me. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2561.2s)]
*  Yeah. 60% of the profit goes to them. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2567.3599999999997s)]
*  I just gave up 60% of my profit on my home. It makes no sense. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2568.56s)]
*  Right. And the crazy thing is that a bad sale of your home would be, let's call it, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2572.24s)]
*  $900,000 or a million, and a great sale would be $1.2. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2578.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2582.16s)]
*  There's a very small margin where they actually have an impact based on the quality of their [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2582.96s)]
*  effort, but they get compensated for the whole thing. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2587.6s)]
*  Nothing. Yeah. For the whole thing, no matter what. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2591.04s)]
*  Yeah. They should get compensated. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2592.08s)]
*  No matter the outcome. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2593.28s)]
*  It should be that you get a flat rate, $10,000 at a million, and then you get [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2594.0s)]
*  10% over a million or something you could give just like you might with a salesperson. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2599.6800000000003s)]
*  The incentive comp should be variable based on performance, whereas the guaranteed part [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2603.92s)]
*  of the comp should be, like you said, a flat fee. It's kind of like the salesperson has an OTE. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2610.24s)]
*  Exactly. Like a SaaS. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2614.64s)]
*  They've got a basic variable. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2615.2s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you could say, if you said 1% up to a million, so that's 10K, and then 10% [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2616.72s)]
*  for the next 100K, and then 20% for the next 100K. So that 1.2 million is really hard to get. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2622.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I'll give you 20% of that incremental 100. That would be a much better deal [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2629.4399999999996s)]
*  because you'll be getting paid for the actual performance. So anyway, really interesting. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2633.52s)]
*  Jake, I have an idea for the National Association of Realtors. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2637.6s)]
*  Oh, here we go. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2640.6400000000003s)]
*  If they want to stop being perceived as an evil monopolist, all they got to do is put out a cringe [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2642.32s)]
*  ad talking about the environment. Everyone's going to love them again. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2646.32s)]
*  Absolutely. They should do an ad where they have a diverse cast of people, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2648.7200000000003s)]
*  and that diverse cast could talk about putting sustainable forestry around it. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2653.28s)]
*  All they got to do is say something, something, landfills. Everyone will love them again. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2659.04s)]
*  They can charge 60%. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2662.08s)]
*  Absolutely. Virtue signaling. They can change flats. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2663.1200000000003s)]
*  Something, something, landfills. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2665.28s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. All right. Let's keep the train moving here. The AI landscape shifting yet again. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2666.56s)]
*  Microsoft is just in. Another one of these shadow aqua hires, this time of Inflection AI bizarre deal. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2672.56s)]
*  Microsoft has hired most of the team at Inflection AI, including the CEO, Mustafa, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2680.32s)]
*  who everybody knows. I just actually had him on this week in startups. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2685.92s)]
*  He was the co-founder of DeepMind. He worked at Google for years, and now he's going to be the CEO [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2688.72s)]
*  of a new company called Microsoft AI. It's essentially the consumer AI division of Microsoft, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2695.2s)]
*  but they did give him the CEO title for background. Inflection had raised 1.5 billion [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2701.28s)]
*  over the last two years. It was one of these giant fundings that occurred to build a foundational [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2706.48s)]
*  model like OpenAI is doing, like ImproPic is doing. They had a chat bot called Pi, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2711.84s)]
*  very similar to chat GPT. It was supposed to remember your history and build a relationship [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2718.0s)]
*  with you. That's all getting shut down. Reid Hoffman, who is a major investor in this company [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2722.08s)]
*  and who's on the board of Microsoft and who's so linked into Microsoft, played an important role [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2728.24s)]
*  in this deal according to reports. The Inflection investors included Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2733.36s)]
*  and a bunch of other interesting folks. This was an aqua hire, which is the weird thing, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2738.7999999999997s)]
*  Chamath. They hired all the employees. They leave the shell of a company. The company is going to go [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2743.68s)]
*  do some enterprise stuff and investors get to keep their equity inflection. But I guess that [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2748.72s)]
*  might be worthless. There's something going on here that we don't know about this deal structure. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2755.12s)]
*  When you saw this deal and you see Satya taking the entire team, like he threatened to do with [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2760.24s)]
*  opening eye. If you remember the same exact kind of thing, I'll acquire everybody. If you don't [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2766.08s)]
*  take the deal, what is your take of what's going on here? Why did this occur like this instead of [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2769.3599999999997s)]
*  just buying the company? I mean, it occurred like this because Reid and Bill are inexorably [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2775.52s)]
*  tied to Microsoft. So they were able to get a deal for investors that would have never happened [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2782.16s)]
*  otherwise. And so good on them. I think they did a very good job protecting the fiduciary interests [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2786.4s)]
*  of the investors of this startup. Sax, no conflict, no interest. Yeah, I mean, we say that a lot. This [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2792.16s)]
*  is so weird, though. Why not buy the company, Sax? Is it because of antitrust? Actually, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2799.6s)]
*  that's a good theory. It's just as hard for Microsoft to get anything through at this point. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2805.04s)]
*  So probably they're just like, why even deal with the antitrust? They don't really need the assets. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2809.68s)]
*  So I think they license the core tech from the inflection C Corp, and then they hire away all the [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2814.08s)]
*  talent. And then the investors get made whole. So I think it's like an aqua hire with a little bit [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2820.48s)]
*  of tech along with it that they get through the licensing deal. Maybe that's just to protect them [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2827.6s)]
*  from an IP standpoint. My take on this is that this was a bailout. This was a bailout of the [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2831.92s)]
*  investors. I don't think investors got ripped off here. I think the investors were like thrilled to [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2837.28s)]
*  get their money back for whatever reason. This company wasn't going anywhere. And it raised [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2841.52s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars. Reed and Bill obviously are wired in there on the Microsoft board. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2845.28s)]
*  And this company did have some talent that Microsoft wanted. So they basically did a giant [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2850.88s)]
*  aqua hire and it bailed out the investors. Freeburg, is that your take? This is a bailout? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2856.16s)]
*  Or do you think this is a new interesting and run around antitrust where, hey, if Adobe wants [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2861.12s)]
*  to buy the next Figma, just buy the team, do a license of Figma, some focacca lunacy? Or do [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2867.04s)]
*  you think this is a bala? What was your theory here? Freeburg, what does it say about Microsoft's [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2875.12s)]
*  approach to the AI space? I don't think this is some run around antitrust. I think obviously, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2880.0s)]
*  like a lot of companies, there's been a realization on how quickly foundational model [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2886.7999999999997s)]
*  development is commoditizing and how quickly costs are escalating and how many folks are chasing it. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2892.48s)]
*  So having some unique advantage in the particular plane of the market, where they were participating [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2899.68s)]
*  as a startup, maybe became difficult and untenable and negotiations and conversations [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2906.24s)]
*  between all these parties who all know each other very, very well and are all very friendly. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2913.28s)]
*  This ended up being the best way to move forward. All right. There you have it, folks. In other [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2918.1600000000003s)]
*  related news, the Saudis are planning a $40 billion AI fund, according to the New York Times reps [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2923.76s)]
*  from the Public Investment Fund in Saudi have spoken to a number of firms about partnering on [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2929.52s)]
*  it. This would be the second largest venture fund of all time behind SoftBank's $100 billion [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2936.32s)]
*  Vision Fund, which you remember was also backed by the Saudis and some other folks in Middle East [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2940.8s)]
*  region. This new fund would reportedly invest in AI startups, chip companies and data centers. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2946.4s)]
*  So we thought we'd do a little quiz here. If you were given the $40 billion, David Sachs, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2952.48s)]
*  how would you allocate the $40 billion in AI in today's market 2024 going on? If they put you in [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2957.84s)]
*  charge of this $40 billion AI fund, where would you deploy it? Same question would come around the [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2964.4s)]
*  horn to you, Freberg and then you, Chamath. Well, the first thing is I wouldn't be in a rush to [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2970.96s)]
*  deploy all 40 billion at once because that's the recipe for spraying a lot of money into [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2976.32s)]
*  unproductive or overhyped things. So I would take my time, first of all. But second, in terms of [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2980.56s)]
*  kind of the framework, I would think about the different levels of the stack of AI and try to [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2986.32s)]
*  figure out where the value capture is going to be. And I think there's maybe four different layers [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2991.36s)]
*  of the stack. First, you've got the silicon, you've got the chips where Nvidia is dominant. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2995.52s)]
*  Then you've got the foundation models where it's open AI and then there's some open source models. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=2999.84s)]
*  And then you've got kind of infrastructure, dev tools, vector databases, things like that. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3004.88s)]
*  And then finally, you have the applications sitting on top of that, which are just getting [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3009.04s)]
*  started. I think it's really hard to know from what we're seeing today exactly who's going to [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3012.6400000000003s)]
*  capture the most value in the stack. I mean, you could make an argument for against pretty much [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3016.96s)]
*  any layer of the stack. I guess if I had 40 billion to deploy, what I would do is try to identify who [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3022.0s)]
*  are the leading companies at each level of the stack and then who are the most promising [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3028.16s)]
*  challengers. And I would make a bet at every layer so I'm covered. That's not what I personally do [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3032.88s)]
*  because I'm just not a hardware investor. I'm not really an infrastructure investor. I'm more of an [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3038.56s)]
*  application investor. So I'm going to focus on that fourth layer of the stack and just trust [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3044.48s)]
*  that there's going to be enough value there. But again, if I was managing a $40 billion sovereign [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3049.2s)]
*  wealth fund, then I would play at every single level and I would hire the best people who know [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3053.44s)]
*  each layer of that stack. Saks, I think you did a good job of sort of showing the four layers of [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3059.2s)]
*  the stack. I think open source, the application layer and specifically robotics are huge [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3064.72s)]
*  opportunities that are under invested in right now. So I would take the top open source projects. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3070.0s)]
*  I'd find those top contributors, take the top 20 or so open source projects and back them to the tune [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3074.56s)]
*  of significant money, 50 million, a hundred million, whatever it takes and try to own the top 20 or [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3079.84s)]
*  have insights into those top 20 open source models and own those teams. Look for the top contributors, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3085.76s)]
*  really easy to do on GitHub and hugging face and replete and other places where they're active [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3091.68s)]
*  and empower those. Then obviously there's verticals. We're working on people who are [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3097.2s)]
*  doing screenplays and tax just like you are Saks. And that's a fantastic place to deploy money. But [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3102.3999999999996s)]
*  then I think robotics is going to be super, super compelling here. And that takes a lot of money. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3107.7599999999998s)]
*  And so you do have the capital as a weapon and the 20 year view of this and making a general [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3113.9199999999996s)]
*  person purpose robot like Elon's doing with optimists or figure AI is doing with their robot. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3120.56s)]
*  I think robotics is a major place. You can probably buy it. I don't know who owns Boston Dynamics. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3127.04s)]
*  Now I know Google sold it. So you can probably buy some robotic companies and then put the AI on them [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3131.92s)]
*  and really take a 20 year view of robotics. Freeberg, your thoughts, how would you deploy [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3137.36s)]
*  the 40 million? The bottom three stacks are very difficult right now to find. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3143.2s)]
*  A footing obviously, I think Saks, it's the generally accepted framework for how to think [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3150.96s)]
*  about how the market has broken apart. But on the application side, I think is where you could [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3157.2799999999997s)]
*  think about finding more traditional business model advantages. So I think your point about [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3163.44s)]
*  robotics is a really interesting one. Is there a enterprise like sale of robotics tools that have [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3171.84s)]
*  positive ROI for enterprises? And is there a business that's working there and that is scalable? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3178.0s)]
*  Vertical solutions in labor and automation and productivity gains are probably the best sharp [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3183.04s)]
*  ratio. Good alpha, lower beta, and a good place to kind of deploy competing in chips, competing [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3189.6s)]
*  in infrastructure, competing in models. It's such a, you know, as we just talked about with respect [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3197.04s)]
*  to what happened with inflection and Microsoft this week, it's such a rapidly changing environment. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3202.24s)]
*  It's hard to have high confidence in where things are headed there. So I do think that we do know [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3207.68s)]
*  that there are enterprise markets. We know that there are segments of things like food, medicine, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3212.56s)]
*  you know, manufacturing. These are markets that aren't going anywhere. And they could all certainly [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3218.48s)]
*  benefit from unlocks in software or in robotics and automation and hardware. So that's probably [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3223.12s)]
*  where I would think about concentrating capital. But you know, 40 billion is a lot of money. So [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3229.44s)]
*  you'd probably think about deploying it over what period of time is a 10 billion a year over four [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3235.04s)]
*  years. And then is it broken apart in what way over those sectors and over what geographies and, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3239.52s)]
*  you know, then find good managers to help you get it deployed. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3245.2799999999997s)]
*  Trimoth, you're batting clean up here. You got to hear everybody's answers before giving your own. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3249.36s)]
*  What are your thoughts on your other besties answers and what's your plan to deploy 40 billion [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3253.92s)]
*  for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia's public investment fund? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3259.52s)]
*  The most important thing that fund managers get wrong is not having appropriate reserves for your [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3263.2s)]
*  winners. And if I look back, the real profit dollars that I leaked was not investing enough [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3268.56s)]
*  up front, but when I didn't have enough reserve to do the full pro rata or even super pro rata and [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3276.64s)]
*  the ones that worked. So the first thing you have to do, and when I do the regression on all of my [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3281.9199999999996s)]
*  funds, you really need to reserve between 40 and 50% of a total fund size for reserves. So take 20 [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3286.0s)]
*  billion off the table. And now you have a smaller problem, which is how do you deploy 20 billion? [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3292.48s)]
*  Because the other 20 billion is purely meant for the winners, where you cram the money into the few [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3296.96s)]
*  that are winning so that you can make the most money of that 20 billion. I would probably take [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3301.92s)]
*  two thirds of it. And I would go to all the hyperscalers and anybody that's providing cloud [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3308.08s)]
*  compute and essentially buy out all of the compute credits on GPUs. So that I could tell any startup [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3314.4s)]
*  in the world, you will do a safe with me, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I will give you free [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3322.24s)]
*  compute on pick your cloud provider, pick your model, I don't care. So if you want to run llama [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3329.52s)]
*  on grok, great. If you want to run Mistral on GCP, great. If you want to run open AI on open AI, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3335.68s)]
*  fantastic. But we will pay for all the compute in return, we get 7% up front. And you have to [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3343.3599999999997s)]
*  tell us some benchmark of how this model is improving. And then you are hiring a team of [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3349.2s)]
*  people whose job it is, and you can probably train a model to do this as well. To ingest the reporting [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3355.8399999999997s)]
*  in a systematic way to understand if it is as you guys said, a robotics company, there are measures [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3362.48s)]
*  of the quality of a robot, a robot's dexterity or vision or manipulation or tax completion rate. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3368.7999999999997s)]
*  If it's a search engine, it's a different thing. If it's a consumer facing app, it could be users. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3375.76s)]
*  If it's a drug discovery app, it's the number of legitimate protein synthesis passes that pass, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3379.84s)]
*  whatever it is. So now you've scoped the problem to 20 billion is in reserves, 15 billion of it is [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3387.36s)]
*  tied up in credits. And then the 5 billion, I do think it's what David said, what sac said, which [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3394.2400000000002s)]
*  is a billion and a half to the hardware, a billion and a half to infrastructure, a billion and a half [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3398.7200000000003s)]
*  to some of these discrete ideas. You probably need a 30 or 40 person team total no more. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3403.68s)]
*  But that business could make a trillion dollars if it was set up that way. But the key is to get the [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3411.2799999999997s)]
*  credits out to people so that the reality is what the commonality across every single AI startup [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3415.9199999999996s)]
*  is that they will have to run on a model. And that model will be hosted somewhere in a cloud. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3423.52s)]
*  All of that compute will need to be paid for. So Saudi Arabia should pay for that compute, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3428.72s)]
*  get six or 7% upfront and retitle the safe, not as the, what is a safe call, Jason? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3434.0s)]
*  Simple agreement for future equity. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3442.4s)]
*  This should be the Saudi agreement for future equity. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3445.04s)]
*  I love it. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3448.88s)]
*  That's what they should do. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3449.68s)]
*  Well, there you have it, MBS, the all in KSA $40 billion fund. Give us a call. We'll fire it up [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3450.48s)]
*  and we'll deploy the 40 billion for you. My kid, maybe. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3457.6s)]
*  Actually, I'm curious, you guys, since everyone kind of seems to agree with the framework of the [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3461.8399999999997s)]
*  four levels of the stack, where do you guys think the value capital is going to be? Do you think [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3466.4s)]
*  it's going to be by the chip companies, the foundation model companies, the infrastructure [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3470.72s)]
*  companies or the applications? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3476.48s)]
*  I'll actually change my answer in a little bit. I don't think it's necessarily new technology [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3478.64s)]
*  companies per se that are going to benefit most, but I think that it's businesses in [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3482.96s)]
*  traditional industries that are going to be able to leverage these tools, whether they're [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3487.12s)]
*  using open source tools or third party technology capabilities that they're buying as a service or [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3490.96s)]
*  as a piece of software. There's an incredible set of advances are going to be realized in things [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3496.8s)]
*  like chemical manufacturing, drugs, general manufacturing that have existing scale and [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3501.52s)]
*  infrastructure that are the fastest to move to adopt these technologies are going to benefit [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3507.36s)]
*  the most. And I think that's probably where most of the value will accrue is not necessarily a chip [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3513.1200000000003s)]
*  company, but in other businesses and traditional industries that can transform themselves using [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3517.52s)]
*  AI. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3523.44s)]
*  So your answer is that the application level and then within application level, you could [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3524.32s)]
*  divide it up between existing companies and startups and existing companies that are able to [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3528.6400000000003s)]
*  leverage AI innovations that are lower in the stack. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3533.44s)]
*  Another way to answer your question, Sachs is, which is the most crap, which spaces are the most [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3536.96s)]
*  crowded already. And so obviously chips are super crowded, lots of incumbents, lots of people going [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3542.08s)]
*  after it. And the foundation models are very crowded as well. And the application level is yet to [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3546.24s)]
*  sort of be built out, right? Cause we're in year zero or year one of that. So I do think application [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3552.96s)]
*  levels where there's a lot of value, but I also think the hosting and the development of these [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3557.52s)]
*  various niche models is going to be a huge opportunity. So just once again, those open [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3563.6s)]
*  source models being put into a cloud computing environments and optimized, that could be a whole [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3568.0s)]
*  new level of AWS's and Google cloud and Azure's. So there's an opportunity for somebody to compete [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3573.76s)]
*  with those incumbents by just being better at those models that are open source and having the team [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3580.8s)]
*  that's doing those updates and then optimizing that cloud. So I would go with the cloud level [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3587.44s)]
*  for those open source models and providing that as a service like VMware does, or other folks do. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3591.76s)]
*  WordPress would be a tiny example of an open source project like that. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3597.6000000000004s)]
*  And then I just, something tells me this robotic space, which has been a false start over and over [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3601.6000000000004s)]
*  and over again. I think this is the time where actually it's going to work. And so I'm, I love [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3606.48s)]
*  that hardware robotics space. I think you're right, Sachs. I think it's kind of bookended in my mind. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3612.4s)]
*  I think the folks that are building fundamental hardware will make a lot of money over the next [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3617.44s)]
*  five to 10 years. And then the folks that are building the fundamental application level [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3622.88s)]
*  experiences will make a lot of money as well. And then who knows? The thing that we're not talking [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3627.92s)]
*  about enough, and I don't understand it well enough is the entire way in which apps are built [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3633.76s)]
*  needs to fundamentally be rethought from first principles, because you essentially basically [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3639.44s)]
*  have these client server apps where you have all of this business logic that's sitting back in some [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3644.32s)]
*  server somewhere. And I don't think that that's how apps get built today in a world of AI. And so [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3651.76s)]
*  it doesn't need to work that way. So I don't exactly know what that means, but it just seems [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3657.84s)]
*  like most of the architecture of how the internet works today doesn't make much sense. So that would [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3662.88s)]
*  then support Freebrook's point that all of the kind of the legacy things that we all know and trust [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3667.5200000000004s)]
*  also get rebuilt. And so that could create an entire wave where networking value gets recreated [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3672.4s)]
*  and everything. So my gosh, I mean, it could be very, very transformational. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3677.6s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the idea that you would just talk to a computer or in a chat interface and you [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3682.0s)]
*  wouldn't use an app interface. You would just ask it questions. It would give you answers, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3687.68s)]
*  ask you questions. It gives you answers, give it a task. It gives you a result. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3690.88s)]
*  This is why, this is why like Saudi needs to basically make a bet that there's just developers [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3694.16s)]
*  that are swarming around ideas. Let them show you what's happening because paying 800 million a year [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3699.52s)]
*  of fees is not the best way to generate a return on $40 billion. If this is where you want to be [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3705.92s)]
*  investing, I don't think 800 million could pay for a lot of credits, which probably gets you one [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3711.44s)]
*  step closer to the, to the answer. Or Reddit when public today, they have 800 million in revenue. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3715.76s)]
*  Company is worth over $8 billion in trading. It's a 50%. What do you think, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3721.52s)]
*  Chamath, is this the opening of the IPO window again? So, so one off gets tribe coming. And [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3728.64s)]
*  what do you take from it popping 50% on the first day? I don't know. I really haven't looked at the [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3734.16s)]
*  company. I haven't looked at the, the financials, but like this last three or four weeks, I think [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3741.6s)]
*  people have been so excited and rearing to go. We're in the middle of another meme coin craze. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3748.3199999999997s)]
*  God, don't bring it up. We are all getting pulled into that nonsense. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3755.6s)]
*  I think the point is that I think there is a speculative party going on right now. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3759.52s)]
*  And I'm not saying that Reddit is part of it, but whenever these things are so mispriced, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3765.52s)]
*  just means that people are ready to gamble a little bit. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3772.0s)]
*  There's definitely a lot of gambling in the system as we've seen. And we're recording this on Thursday. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3775.04s)]
*  So who knows what the stock price will be tomorrow. Generally, I mean, by the way, sorry, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3779.92s)]
*  the other thing is like Powell did say finally, it looks pretty likely we're going to get these [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3784.8s)]
*  three cuts. So we're going to be down to four and a half to four, seven, five on fed funds by the [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3789.52s)]
*  end of the year. It probably means that we'll get another 50 to 75 basis points to 2025. So people [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3796.4s)]
*  will look out to the end of 2025 and look at a fed funds rate. That's sort of like three, seven, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3802.8s)]
*  five to 4%. So they're getting pretty excited and frothed up. So this is the beginning of the [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3808.0800000000004s)]
*  beginning in terms of that kind of speculation. Yeah, we saw crypto go bonkers the last couple [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3814.56s)]
*  of weeks. Yeah. What's your take on all this? Sax, does it feel like people are in gamble [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3819.68s)]
*  mode again? And does that concern you, I guess, after what we just experienced? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3827.12s)]
*  Well, I think they're pricing in these rate cuts as if they're definitely going to happen. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3832.72s)]
*  Like Jamal said, I think the market's expectation is with, let's call it 70% certainty that you're [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3836.7999999999997s)]
*  going to get three rate cuts this year. And it still seems to me that that's a little bit up in [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3844.0s)]
*  the air because inflation has not come down to the Fed's target of 2%. It's still right around 3%, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3849.12s)]
*  3.1%. So it's been sticky around 3%. It was coming down pretty fast last year, but it's still there. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3855.76s)]
*  So people I think are maybe gambling in the sense that they're counting on rate cuts that haven't [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3863.76s)]
*  happened yet, but they liked Powell's dovish rhetoric yesterday. And they seem to think that [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3868.24s)]
*  that means that the rate cuts are definitely coming. I don't know how Powell can promise that [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3876.4799999999996s)]
*  without inflation coming down unless he's trying to create a Biden put. There it is, folks. Which [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3881.2799999999997s)]
*  was my theory going into this year is that we would get a Biden put from the Fed. Absolutely. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3887.52s)]
*  And it's looking like Biden has a clear path to victory based on the lowest unemployment [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3894.0s)]
*  of our lifetimes and this roaring stock market records. Yeah, it's just an easy Biden victory. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3898.96s)]
*  Friedberg, what do you think about the risk on? I don't know. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3905.52s)]
*  Biden is incredibly unpopular. If you look at his actual polling, he should not win the election. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3912.4s)]
*  But that's in spite of, you're right, the economy seems to be doing pretty well. The stock market's [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3917.76s)]
*  certainly doing pretty well. A president with these fundamentals would normally get reelected, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3922.08s)]
*  but Biden currently is not, his polling is not the polling of a president who's going to get [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3928.48s)]
*  reelected. It is pretty amazing. But if Powell comes through with the rate cuts, that will help him. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3932.56s)]
*  It's pretty amazing how horrible a job he's doing that he's made Trump look like a better [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3938.96s)]
*  candidate to some people. That is an extraordinary achievement by Biden, I have to agree there. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3942.7999999999997s)]
*  Look, I think the bigger economic issue to be talking about was that buried article in [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3949.6s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal about commercial real estate. Do you see that article? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3955.52s)]
*  That was crazy. So this Wall Street Journal article reported that of the 36 billion of [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3959.68s)]
*  office loans that came due in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market last year, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3964.4s)]
*  only one quarter were paid off in full. That's according to data from real estate analytics [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3970.8s)]
*  from cred 10. Is that extend and pretend strategy that you see there? Oh, yeah. I mean, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3975.92s)]
*  only one quarter of the loans got paid off. So 75% didn't get paid off in full. So there's tons of [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3981.12s)]
*  buildings that are underwater right now, but nobody wants to foreclose and then sell them [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3988.08s)]
*  at a fire sale price. So yeah, everyone is it's pretend and extend. Yeah, kicking the can down [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3994.2400000000002s)]
*  the road. Nobody wants to take the medicine. So yeah, they're hoping they're hoping that rates [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=3999.6800000000003s)]
*  will come down fast enough and occupancy rates will go up fast enough that no one has to foreclose. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4003.2s)]
*  But if rates don't come down, then you have a real problem. I mean, again, everyone is just assuming [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4009.7599999999998s)]
*  that inflation will continue its path from 3% to 2% and then we'll get these rate cuts. And they're [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4015.4399999999996s)]
*  hoping they can cling on. Landlords are clinging on and I think the banks that loan them all this [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4021.52s)]
*  money are playing on for dear life. But if rates stay higher longer, then you're going to see some [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4026.08s)]
*  real distress. Yeah, including the regional banking system. Freeburg, you had a science [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4033.84s)]
*  corner here a couple of different things came up the Hubble telescope, 3d printed [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4038.7999999999997s)]
*  organs. What do you want to go with this? I mean, do you guys want to talk about [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4044.7999999999997s)]
*  how the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate and expanding differentially everywhere we [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4048.7999999999997s)]
*  look and we don't understand how or why? 100% and Sachs needs to use the loo. So yeah, definitely. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4053.84s)]
*  I love science quarter. Let's do it. Freeburg, it's your time to sign to shine. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4063.52s)]
*  Tell us what's going on with the universe. My favorite topic, astrophysics. My favorite topic. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4070.08s)]
*  My favorite topic. Sachs is back. Are we headed for Uranus? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4075.84s)]
*  We're actually dead set on it. We're dead. He disappeared again. He's just going to drop in [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4079.68s)]
*  and do Uranus jokes. I hear him giggling with his camera off. He's with his writers. He just [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4085.76s)]
*  went to the writers room to get an update on the Uranus jokes. It's long been known that our [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4091.6s)]
*  universe is expanding. We've all heard about the Big Bang theory and a couple decades ago, scientists [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4098.64s)]
*  began to observe the brightness of supernovae or exploding stars. Then by looking at their [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4107.6s)]
*  brightness, we could tell how far away they were. Then looking at the shift of the light, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4117.360000000001s)]
*  whether it's getting red or blue, you can tell whether the supernova is moving away from us or [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4121.68s)]
*  towards us and how quickly. What scientists have used those observations to deduce several decades [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4128.240000000001s)]
*  ago and for which a group won the Nobel Prize is that our universe is expanding, meaning that [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4136.64s)]
*  everything is moving away from itself. It's almost as if we're all in a cake. The best analogy I've [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4144.72s)]
*  heard is that there's raisins in the cake. As the cake expands in the oven, all of those raisins [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4149.4400000000005s)]
*  look around and they're all moving apart from each other. The distance between everything is [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4155.200000000001s)]
*  getting wider. Space is expanding. From the central moment of the Big Bang. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4160.72s)]
*  That's the theory. It's all started in the Big Bang. It's not like we're all in the middle of [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4166.72s)]
*  the universe and the universe is moving away from us. It's that the entirety of space is expanding [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4171.360000000001s)]
*  itself. Everything is moving away from everything else. The challenge in the data was that recently, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4177.04s)]
*  we saw that different types of stars that were observed with the Hubble Space Telescope [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4182.240000000001s)]
*  had actually a different rate of expansion of the universe than what was previously thought [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4188.96s)]
*  from the supernova that we saw. Everyone thought there was something wrong with the Hubble Space [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4195.36s)]
*  Telescope data. In a final print published last month, the James Webb Space Telescope, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4199.04s)]
*  which showed much higher resolution of imaging and as a result, much better data. Here's an image [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4207.759999999999s)]
*  of it. You can just see the difference between what came out of James Webb and what was used [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4213.759999999999s)]
*  in Hubble. That shows one star that was used to calculate the rate of expansion of the universe. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4218.24s)]
*  What the star showed is that the rate of expansion of the universe as measured across a thousand of [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4224.64s)]
*  these stars called Cepheid stars in five different galaxies had a value that didn't match the value [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4230.8s)]
*  that we see when we look at exploding stars very far away. It once again confirms what the original [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4236.4s)]
*  Hubble data showed, which is that the universe is expanding at different rates in different parts of [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4243.68s)]
*  the universe, which totally doesn't make sense. There's no really clear answer as to the physics [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4249.44s)]
*  of why. If there was a big bang and the universe started to expand, it should be expanding the same [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4254.16s)]
*  everywhere. There's no reason that different parts of the universe should be expanding at a different [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4259.36s)]
*  rate than other parts of the universe, that there's differential expansion happening across the [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4263.679999999999s)]
*  universe. It really tells us that there's very little we know or understand about this large-scale [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4267.759999999999s)]
*  structure of the universe and why these things are happening. There was one group that put out a [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4273.12s)]
*  theory where they said that the local universe where we see these Cepheid stars that this data [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4277.52s)]
*  is based on, there's almost like a little bubble. On the outside of the bubble, there's galaxies and [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4283.84s)]
*  they're pulling stuff out faster than what's happening where there's not as much density. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4288.240000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of different reasons and explanations for why this might be happening. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4292.320000000001s)]
*  But it's a big story because it basically confirms that we see a lot of differential [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4296.72s)]
*  expansion happening across the universe and we don't know why. Just another big mystery of the [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4301.84s)]
*  universe. So super interesting confirmatory data from James Webb this week. Jamath, do you want to [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4306.24s)]
*  talk about the pig kidney? I think it's really incredible. They took a kidney from a pig [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4311.599999999999s)]
*  and then they use CRISPR-Cas9 to edit out the certain subset of the pig genes and edit in [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4320.639999999999s)]
*  a certain useful subset of human genes. Then they transplanted that kidney into a 64-year-old man. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4327.599999999999s)]
*  I see. He apparently seems to be doing well. It's really incredible. This is a guy that was at end [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4333.04s)]
*  stage kidney disease. My father went through this. But when you're at that end stage renal disease, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4340.16s)]
*  you're getting dialyzed every three days for up to four, five, six hours trying to… Basically, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4348.24s)]
*  you have a machine that does the job, the kidneys for you to keep your blood clean. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4355.44s)]
*  But it's just kind of a death sentence and it's like a slow moving death sentence at that. So the [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4359.28s)]
*  idea that you could now use this effectively infinite source of organs seems really compelling. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4364.96s)]
*  Pretty amazing. I don't know. What do you think? Definitely where we're headed. I don't even think [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4377.679999999999s)]
*  they're going to need… Speaking of medical breakthroughs, did you guys see the [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4384.08s)]
*  guy who got the Neuralink chip? He's using the force. Yeah, that was awesome. He described it [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4390.32s)]
*  as he was playing chess and he said, I love playing chess and I've learned to use my mind to move [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4398.64s)]
*  pieces around. And he said, it's like having the force. I watched the live stream and he said that [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4403.36s)]
*  he was a quadriplegic from the shoulders down, but he loves chess. He wasn't able to play chess. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4411.04s)]
*  Now he's able to play chess. He was able to play civilization, the game, which I guess was really [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4416.16s)]
*  hard in the absence of having this chip. And now he can do that. It's incredible. I mean, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4419.84s)]
*  it's really cool that they kind of went public with it. I mean, obviously he agreed to go public [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4427.2s)]
*  with it. I think Trevor is his name. It's pretty amazing and there's more amazing stuff coming. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4431.92s)]
*  They're making significant progress over there. I was talking to somebody who works there and [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4437.92s)]
*  it's going to be a process, but they're making significant progress and they're going to have, [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4444.24s)]
*  I think, even bigger announcements in the coming year. They're getting it done. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4452.96s)]
*  My kids were really blown away by it. It's interesting to me what penetrates their cynicism [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4458.56s)]
*  bubble and what they get actually impressed or excited by. And they thought this was really cool. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4464.96s)]
*  You know, it's so funny. It's like people are breathlessly looking at the Elon Don Lemon video [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4470.8s)]
*  and they're trying to opine whether he had a good interview or a bad interview. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4476.96s)]
*  And it's like he actually had one of the best weeks of his life. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4480.72s)]
*  Yeah. Starship 3 made it out. Starship had an incredible performance last week and then [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4485.04s)]
*  this thing this week. I mean, what an incredible seven day run. It's more than most of us will [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4491.28s)]
*  have in our lifetime. It's also nuts. That Don Lemon interview, there was actually some really [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4495.679999999999s)]
*  interesting topics discussed, but I felt like this was the perfect baton passing between old media and [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4501.759999999999s)]
*  new media where he was constantly trying to do a gotcha journalism thing. And Elon was trying to [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4509.04s)]
*  engage in good faith and an interesting discussion. And then every time the discussion got interesting, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4514.88s)]
*  he kept trying to go back to sensational gotcha journalism. And it was a totally wasted [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4520.0s)]
*  opportunity. Don Lemon had just stayed in the moment and engaged in good faith instead of [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4524.96s)]
*  trying to get this clip. It was a really bad performance by Don Lemon. I thought [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4530.32s)]
*  it was really getting interesting at moments in time. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4535.92s)]
*  He's obviously trying to get a job back at some mainstream media company. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4538.08s)]
*  Maybe. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4542.24s)]
*  This is his resume. If he can basically get some clip of Elon saying something that he can twist [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4542.64s)]
*  into something that it doesn't mean, and he can say, I got Elon Musk, then he can get his job back [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4549.6s)]
*  at CNN or one of those places. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4554.400000000001s)]
*  He got paid out in full, like 20, 30 million bucks. And by the way, those jobs, they don't exist [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4555.92s)]
*  anymore. Tucker and him were the last of that generation to get those huge paydays. That's over. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4561.6s)]
*  Don Lemon got paid $30 million by whom? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4567.92s)]
*  I think CNN, the report was, CNN paid out his full contract. The same thing happened, I think, [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4571.360000000001s)]
*  with Tucker. They both got paid their full contracts. Whoever negotiates those contracts [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4576.96s)]
*  with the networks over the last couple of decades is awesome because it's pay for play. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4580.56s)]
*  Whether you are on air or not, you get paid and then they don't let you go to a competitor. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4587.36s)]
*  That's why both of them are doing internet stuff, X or whatever, carved out stuff. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4592.4s)]
*  I just wanted to give a shout out here at the end of the pod for the guys at All In Talk. Chris [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tEcLAud7Nc&t=4597.36s)]
