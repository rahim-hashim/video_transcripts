*  Or it could be like a Biden moment circling the dead. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=109.48s)]
*  That's too dark. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=113.76s)]

*  us for conversations on that front. So it's shaping up to be [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=210.4s)]
*  really amazing programming. Like Jason said, we're, we held back [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=213.68s)]
*  400 tickets from the initial batch, and we're going to [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=217.56s)]
*  release 100 this week. So put an application in, we're trying to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=220.12s)]
*  be selective. And it's going to be amazing. The parties are [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=223.08s)]
*  going to be awesome. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=226.68s)]
*  All right, really excited how it's coming together. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=228.04s)]
*  You're doing some bird of a feather dinners. I understand [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=230.12s)]
*  this year some new concept. Can you explain that to me? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=233.68s)]
*  The first night of the summit, we're we've rented out a bunch [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=235.88s)]
*  of great restaurants around town in LA. And we're putting people [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=239.6s)]
*  together for dinner at all these different restaurants. And then [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=242.48s)]
*  the parties are nights two and three, which are going to be, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=244.88s)]
*  you know, beautiful. Everybody's gonna be great. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=248.16s)]
*  Everybody comes to the parties. But that first night, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=250.04s)]
*  everyone comes to the dinners, everything. Yeah, it's gonna be [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=251.92s)]
*  great. So we're trying to create more space for people to meet [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=253.68s)]
*  each other. I know that's been a big thing in the past in the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=255.68s)]
*  meetups and at the summit is people love meeting other folks [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=258.2s)]
*  in the community. So [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=260.88s)]
*  yeah, smaller groups. So the dinners will be 200 people or [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=261.96s)]
*  something like that you can expect 100 depending on the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=264.76s)]
*  location. Yeah. Yeah. And then the bigger parties will be [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=266.8s)]
*  everybody 1800 people. So where do people apply for this? It's at [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=269.36s)]
*  summit.allinpodcast.co. Okay, there you go, folks. And you can [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=272.52s)]
*  come to the free events. You can come there. All right, just [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=277.84000000000003s)]
*  usually we when we do the doc and I pursue a mullet doc and I [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=280.8s)]
*  do the business first and the party in the back. But man, we [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=284.04s)]
*  got to start with Washington. I've never supported the mullet [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=286.32s)]
*  strategy. I know that I know that you've been anti mullet from [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=288.72s)]
*  the beginning. You want this to be a political show? No, no, no, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=292.24s)]
*  I never said that would be a political show. Exactly. I always [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=295.32s)]
*  said, we start with the biggest most topical issues first. And [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=298.20000000000005s)]
*  it could be business or it could be politics. Correct. You were [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=301.8s)]
*  discriminating against the politics. You were insisting [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  that it be a business issue, even if the business wasn't [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=306.8s)]
*  relevant, topical or interesting. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  No, I was not. I think you're talking about Friedberg. Friedberg [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=312.32s)]
*  was the one. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=315.44s)]
*  That's true. It mostly came from Friedberg. Who brought the [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=316.04s)]
*  ratings this pod to a whole new level? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=319.88s)]
*  Yeah, free. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=322.24s)]
*  Who built this thing? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=324.36s)]
*  By the way, I mean, the ratings this pod hit some sort of new [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=332.44s)]
*  stratospheric level, not just with President Trump interview, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=335.92s)]
*  but last week, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=339.68s)]
*  whatever. I mean, the point is, last week was, I think the most [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=341.08s)]
*  crazy week in the history of politics, and it's only going to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=346.92s)]
*  get crazier. So let's start off with hot swap summary. You heard [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=349.92s)]
*  of your first or maybe not hot swap summer continues, you know, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=353.76s)]
*  previously, historically, if you wanted to understand who's [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=356.76s)]
*  winning an election, you'd look at the polls. Not perfect. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=358.8s)]
*  Obviously, some of these polls still call landlides, yada, yada. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=361.6s)]
*  But then people built models, obviously, 538, all this kind of [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=364.72s)]

*  people are really focused on prediction markets, aka betting [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=371.2s)]
*  markets. And we're looking at them in real time. And obviously, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=374.44s)]
*  people have skin in the game. So you can I'm interested in the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  panel's take on the sharps on these platforms. And if you [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=383.64s)]
*  think that they're more accurate than, say, some of these polls, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=386.8s)]
*  or the aggregators of polls, but Kamala Harris is now the favorite [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=390.40000000000003s)]

*  let that soak in. In the last 24 hours, VP Harris's chances of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=398.53999999999996s)]

*  Michelle Obama, Gretchen Whitmer, all in the 812%. But [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=416.2s)]
*  they were low single digits prior to last week's debate. As [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=420.64s)]

*  York Times reported that Biden called an ally he's considering [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=434.0s)]

*  morning. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=459.6s)]
*  After we record the show, we have to do before we publish a [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=461.96s)]
*  whole [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=465.88s)]
*  well, I don't I don't think he's gonna do that because he is [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=466.48s)]
*  scheduled to do a sit down interview with George [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=469.16s)]
*  Stephanopoulos. I think they're recording it on Friday, right, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=472.56s)]
*  which is there. Oh, hold on. He's gonna do an interview with [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=476.28s)]
*  Stephanopoulos on Friday. And then Stephanopoulos is showing [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  it in two parts on Saturday and Sunday. So it's going to be [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=484.08s)]
*  edited. So we don't know what they're going to edit in or edit [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=487.23999999999995s)]
*  out. At this point, though, the media isn't such a reading [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=489.76s)]
*  frenzy that I don't think that ABC is going to cover for Biden. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=493.0s)]
*  So I suspect it'll probably be a pretty fair representation of [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=496.84s)]
*  the actual recorded interview. In any event, that's coming out [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=502.59999999999997s)]
*  this weekend. I think the Biden presidency basically hinges on [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=505.4s)]
*  this interview if Biden can show that he's sharp and he's [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=508.44s)]
*  responsive and not senile. And presumably he's going to sit [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=513.88s)]
*  down and do this at the best hours of the day, right? They [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=517.0799999999999s)]
*  can't make that excuse anymore. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=519.04s)]
*  So is that before nap time or after nap time? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=520.36s)]
*  Right, exactly. So I'm sure he can do this at a time when he [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=522.64s)]
*  has the good stuff. I think if he knocks out of the park, maybe [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=526.64s)]
*  he can quell all of this speculation. But if not, if it [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=529.64s)]
*  goes poorly, then I think he's done. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=533.32s)]
*  So this is the last chance again. It's like this is like [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=535.2800000000001s)]
*  the third last chance. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=538.6s)]
*  Yeah, because think about it. I mean, the accusation is that [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=539.84s)]
*  he's senile. That's not a hard thing to disprove. If you're not [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=543.6s)]
*  actually senile, right, you just need to go in there. Right. It's [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=547.1600000000001s)]
*  a pretty low bar, right? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=551.24s)]
*  Not senile. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=553.12s)]
*  Yeah. So he just needs to go in there and have the balls for [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  whatever it is an hour. And he's not gonna be fed a hard, hard [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=557.8800000000001s)]
*  ball question, probably pretty softball questions. He just has [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=561.4s)]
*  to prove that he's not senile. If he can do that, it'll calm [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=564.28s)]
*  things down. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=567.24s)]
*  Stefanopoulos generally does a good job. He's not a sycophant. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=568.28s)]
*  I think he considers himself a legit journalist and will will [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=571.52s)]
*  actually well this is [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=575.1999999999999s)]
*  some fastballs I think [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=577.48s)]
*  Bernstein moment. I mean, like if if Stefanopoulos wants to go [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=579.8s)]
*  into the Hall of Fame, this is his opportunity. If he absolutely [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=583.12s)]
*  if he throws the high heater to Biden and basically is the one [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=586.16s)]
*  that delivers the coup de gras, then his name will be in history [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=590.0s)]
*  alongside Biden for that. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=596.12s)]
*  But think about it. That's the correct analogy. If you're the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=597.48s)]
*  if you're the Democratic Party leaders, and you are evaluating [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=600.44s)]
*  who to choose to replace Biden, the first thing you do is you [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=606.76s)]
*  have to double down on Biden. Because if you were neutral to [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=612.4s)]
*  negative on Biden or passive, it's immediately interpreted as [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=616.52s)]
*  he's being swapped out. And then you don't have time to pick the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=620.56s)]
*  right candidate. In order to have the time to pick the right [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=622.96s)]
*  candidate, you have to first double down on Biden, be really [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=625.4s)]
*  declarative that he's our candidate, put him on media, put [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=628.12s)]
*  him on talk shows while you were figuring out who's going to [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=630.92s)]
*  replace him and what the strategy is to get that person to win. So [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=633.24s)]
*  there's a there's a chance that what's actually going on is a [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=636.8s)]
*  little bit more of a structured strategy around find the right [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=639.28s)]
*  candidate, set up the right program to get them elected, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=642.1999999999999s)]
*  figure out how we're going to move the $120 million that we [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=645.88s)]
*  raised from Biden over to whoever this new candidate you [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=648.68s)]
*  can only you can only move it to Harris, you cannot move it, you [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=651.36s)]
*  cannot move the entire entirety of that budget. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=655.1999999999999s)]
*  You've got to put together a real plan. You can't just do the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=658.8s)]
*  hot swap, you've got to have a plan for the hot swap, which [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=660.92s)]
*  means in the meantime, you got to buy time and the best time is [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=663.28s)]
*  throw Biden forward and be like, hey, look, this guy's gonna go [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=666.28s)]
*  to media. You're still our guy. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=668.4s)]
*  You're correct that they're buying time, obviously, while [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  they try to figure this out. And the powers that be which powers [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=672.36s)]

*  No Strakhanis is off the rails. You said he wouldn't get hot [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=747.8s)]
*  swaps. So you have no [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=751.08s)]
*  if you run a debate, it shows it shows this party, the party [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=753.6s)]
*  needs to select a leader and they need to say this is our [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=757.84s)]

*  there's Gretchen Whitmer. Now it's just her. Why does that [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=832.4s)]
*  happen? Because they realize they can't sidestep Kamala Harris [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=834.64s)]
*  without offending a major constituency in the Democratic [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=838.28s)]
*  Party. Equally important, maybe even more important, they would [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=841.64s)]
*  lose roughly $1 billion of contributions to the Biden [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=844.9599999999999s)]
*  Harris campaign. If neither Biden nor Harris is running at [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=847.76s)]
*  the top of the ticket, they'd have to refund all of that money [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=852.4399999999999s)]
*  back to the donors who contributed it, there's no way [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=855.92s)]
*  they're going to start over from zero in terms of fundraising. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=858.72s)]
*  So they've realized that if Joe steps aside, there is only one [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=861.9599999999999s)]
*  feasible candidate for them, which is Kamala Harris. Let me [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=866.96s)]
*  ask you a question. If Jamie Dimon declared that he's going [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=869.2800000000001s)]
*  to he would be happy to take on the candidacy for the Democratic [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=872.52s)]
*  Party. He would call his friend Warren Buffett, he would call [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=876.32s)]
*  his friend, Jeff Bezos, he would call up his own personal banker [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=880.76s)]
*  and say, we've got half a billion, let's go. And let's [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=885.08s)]
*  have a run at this. There are certain folks that are outside [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=888.32s)]
*  of the typical political spectrum, that might actually [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=891.64s)]
*  have a shot at doing the extraordinary here and stepping [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=895.12s)]
*  up and doing exactly what Trump and others that support Trump [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=898.5600000000001s)]
*  don't want to see happen, which is a candidate that can actually [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=902.8000000000001s)]
*  challenge Trump on the merits of their experience, on their [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=906.64s)]
*  values, on their capabilities as leaders as executives, and on [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=909.88s)]
*  their past performance. And I think that someone like that [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=914.0s)]
*  might be the strategist's kind of move to say, this is the one [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=917.24s)]
*  thing we can do that can defeat Trump, because we all know from [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=922.96s)]
*  the polling that Harris doesn't stand a shot. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=926.32s)]
*  We tried that four years ago, and you're missing the history, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  which is Mike Bloomberg tried that exact same thing. And there [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=931.1600000000001s)]
*  was one word that was set to Mike Billionaire and his [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=934.52s)]
*  candidates imploded. And it was the word billionaire. So the idea [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=936.96s)]
*  that you're going to get some other billionaire that all of a [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=940.48s)]
*  sudden is less hated. I mean, Mike Bloomberg has done some so [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=942.36s)]
*  much good, quite honestly. And so if he can't kind of escape the [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=945.88s)]
*  letter of that of the B word, I don't know anybody else. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=950.88s)]
*  But here's why Bloomberg ran against other Democrats. This is [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=953.88s)]
*  a person that is running against another billionaire, which is [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=956.9200000000001s)]
*  Trump. And so if you have two people who are now on equal [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=959.36s)]
*  footing, and it is the Trump [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=962.84s)]
*  person get [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=966.44s)]
*  let them cook. That's [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=969.6800000000001s)]
*  go free. That's the best you're operating. You're operating under [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=970.76s)]
*  the charming delusion that the Democratic Party cares about [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=973.64s)]
*  democracy. This is basically a party that's run by political [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=977.76s)]
*  insiders that hates billionaires and people like this. People like [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=981.52s)]
*  Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, they pay the Democrats [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=985.8s)]
*  protection money. Okay, that's how Democrats see them. We're [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=988.88s)]
*  going to go shake them down to get money from them. They're not [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=992.56s)]
*  going to hand over the reins of the party. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=994.8s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=996.84s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=998.72s)]
*  Yes, but [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1002.4399999999999s)]
*  he rewrote the rules of the party by running. You're right. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1004.4s)]
*  Hold on. He ran and shattered the party the established power [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1007.84s)]
*  structure. Remember, it was the Bush family's party when Trump [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1011.88s)]
*  first ran. Jeb was supposed to be the nominee, right? He was [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1015.72s)]
*  supposed to inherit the mantle from W the way that W inherited [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1018.76s)]
*  from his father. And Trump came in there and appealed directly to [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1022.5200000000001s)]
*  Republican primary voters, and called the forever wars a [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1026.32s)]
*  mistake, and said he was going to build the wall and said he's [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1029.32s)]
*  going to reset things with China issues that were latent in the [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1032.56s)]
*  Republican Party. And he took over the Republican Party the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1036.16s)]
*  way you're supposed to through democracy, through voting, that [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1038.96s)]
*  opportunity is gone here because the Democratic primaries happened [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1042.28s)]
*  last year. And the Biden team ensured that he would basically [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1045.76s)]
*  win the primaries endily. So they control all the delegates. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1049.96s)]
*  Remember that totally control the delegates, they're not going [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1053.1200000000001s)]
*  to release them to a Jamie Dimon or some other billionaire. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1055.64s)]
*  Well, let me ask you a question. Let me let me ask you a [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1059.28s)]
*  question. So if they if they end up facing the terminal nature of [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1062.16s)]
*  this, which is if we don't put someone in that can win, we lose, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1065.72s)]
*  we are not going to win. Yeah, it is over. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1069.3600000000001s)]
*  Why do you think that Kamala can't win? That's their thinking [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1071.8s)]
*  right now is that she stands a better shot than Biden. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1074.64s)]
*  Let's assume let's assume that they take a read of the polls, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1077.08s)]
*  they take a read of the nation, they actually do a real look at [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1079.76s)]
*  this, the circumstances on the ground, which is that she is not [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1083.0s)]
*  going to win. If they looked at that, and they said, you know [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1086.04s)]
*  what, we need to win. And some sense comes into the head of the [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1088.8s)]
*  leaders of the Democratic Party, and they say, who can win? And a [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1093.68s)]
*  person like Jamie Dimon polls that he can win. There is a [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1097.3600000000001s)]
*  chance, I think that maybe they say this is how we're going to [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1100.8400000000001s)]
*  get back to the White House. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1103.44s)]
*  They're never going to hand the reins of the party to a total [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1104.68s)]
*  outside the Democratic Party is the ultimate insider party. And [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1107.8000000000002s)]
*  they are going to pick an insights insiders picking [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1111.8400000000001s)]
*  insiders. And I think they've realized over the past week, in [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1113.64s)]
*  particular that they cannot sidestep around Kamala Harris, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1116.8000000000002s)]
*  both because it would be a slap in the face to her constituency [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1120.24s)]
*  and the money issue. So it's Kamala or bus for them. It's [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1122.96s)]
*  either Kamala or Biden. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1126.48s)]
*  It's a really good it's a really good point. What we'll see is [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1127.44s)]
*  just how rational the whole the Democratic Party leadership is [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1130.48s)]
*  are they going to continue to play based on insider first [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1133.1200000000001s)]
*  principles? Or will they actually take a first [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1138.16s)]
*  principles point of view on how do we win the election? And I [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1141.08s)]
*  think it will be very revealing about how the leaders of the [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1144.48s)]
*  Democratic Party think based on the decision they make and their [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1147.24s)]
*  donors. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1150.92s)]
*  Well, I don't know if that's true. Because I actually think [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1151.36s)]
*  that there's a [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1153.56s)]
*  because the donors are fleeing the ship, right? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1153.96s)]
*  Yeah, there's a rift between the donor class and the Democratic [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1155.84s)]
*  Party leadership. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1159.0s)]
*  Correct. And I think the donor class doesn't want to lose. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1159.6399999999999s)]
*  And by the way, sacks, what you're saying is probably right, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1162.48s)]
*  but I think it could actually end up being a signal that there [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1164.72s)]
*  might be a change in how the who the donors end up supporting the [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1167.3999999999999s)]
*  next go around for to realize this a leadership change in the [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1170.84s)]
*  Democratic Party. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1175.36s)]
*  Look, what the prediction markets are showing is that it's [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1176.08s)]
*  not going to be a free for all, it's either going to be Harris [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1178.6s)]
*  or Biden. I mean, that's what the prediction markets are [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1181.1999999999998s)]
*  showing. And I think that's fundamentally right. But look, I [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1183.0s)]
*  think there's real danger here to the to the country in this [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1186.84s)]
*  because what a lot of people are saying, and I guess it makes [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1189.8799999999999s)]
*  sense is that if Biden's not fit to run again, how is he fit to [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1192.76s)]
*  serve out the rest of his term? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1197.32s)]
*  He's not fit to serve on his term. He's got to resign. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1198.36s)]
*  Okay, so if he resigns, and that's probably the thing that [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1201.1999999999998s)]
*  helps Harris the most, right, because now she gets sworn in as [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1203.9599999999998s)]
*  commander in chief. She's the president United States. There's [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1207.76s)]
*  like a major president. Yeah, it's a big a major glow up for [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1211.2s)]
*  her. And it imputes her with all of this gravitas and credibility [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1213.92s)]
*  that she's now the president United States, they can send her [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1218.24s)]
*  to g seven meetings and deal with other world leaders. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1221.12s)]
*  They've got four months to basically take this candidate [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1223.8s)]
*  who everyone thought wasn't ready. Remember, a year ago [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1227.64s)]
*  during the primaries, when Biden ran again, one of the reasons [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1230.16s)]
*  why is because everyone said that comments is not ready. You [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1232.68s)]
*  know, every interview she does is basically a cackle or word [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1236.04s)]
*  salad. In any event, no one thought she was ready. Now, they [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1239.08s)]
*  have like basically made her seem much more significant by [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1244.92s)]
*  giving her the presidency. But my point is this we're in the [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1249.1599999999999s)]
*  middle of a war. We're in the middle of a war with Russia. Just [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1252.32s)]
*  a week or two ago, we are Russian that we're in the war, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1257.52s)]
*  or we're providing weapons. Both a week or two ago. American [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1260.32s)]
*  cluster bombs were used to kill Russian civilians sunbathing on [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1265.52s)]
*  the beach in Crimea. Okay, our weapons are targeting killing [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1270.84s)]
*  Russian civilians. The Russians in response to that said, we are [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1275.48s)]
*  no longer in a state of peace with the United States, they did [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1279.68s)]
*  not say we're in a state of war. But they said we're no longer in [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1283.12s)]
*  a state of peace. And the Russians have indicated that they [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1285.84s)]
*  may escalate horizontally, by giving advanced weapons to our [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1288.44s)]
*  enemies. For example, they've talked about giving cruise [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1293.52s)]
*  missiles to the hoodies. Okay, so all of this is happening right [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1295.8799999999999s)]
*  now in real time on the world stage. And you're going to [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1300.08s)]
*  remove Biden who look, I don't like Biden's policies. And I [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1302.6399999999999s)]
*  don't think he's compos mentis for more than a few hours a day. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1307.04s)]
*  But I would still rather have Biden as commander in chief for [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1310.8799999999999s)]
*  the next six months, then take the risk of putting Harrison [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1314.72s)]
*  there, who's inexperienced, who's a lightweight, and who [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1317.44s)]
*  might want to prove how tough she is. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1321.36s)]
*  Let's get your mouth in for the final word here. Your thoughts [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1323.1599999999999s)]
*  on what's going to happen? Make your prediction between now and [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1325.56s)]
*  September? What do you think's the mid game here? Before we get [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1328.56s)]
*  to the end game? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1332.4799999999998s)]
*  I honestly don't know. But I think that we're in a precarious [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1334.84s)]
*  place where things are going to get worse. Biden actually [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1338.04s)]
*  approved private contractors now going into Ukraine and starting [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1343.3999999999999s)]
*  to fight Americans will be on the battlefield as of I think [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1348.52s)]
*  this was just a few days ago. If you remember the movie Wag the [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1353.0s)]
*  Dog, I think that it starts to create all these weird scenarios [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1358.0s)]
*  where people will want to create major distractions to try to [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1361.48s)]
*  keep the evidence and the attention away from this core [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1366.0s)]
*  issue that after the debate, everybody is focused on. I think [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1370.24s)]
*  the reality is that if you were accused, if any of you were [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1373.6s)]
*  accused of being mentally incapacitated, what you would [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1376.08s)]
*  probably do is go on every single talk show, go on every [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1379.6799999999998s)]
*  single new show, go on every single podcast press conference, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1383.3999999999999s)]
*  you would just do so much public facing work so as to completely [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1386.4399999999998s)]
*  dispel this idea so that you could firmly say it was a cold. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1391.9199999999998s)]
*  Although now this week, it's jet lag, it was it was jet lag, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1396.1999999999998s)]
*  the time of day, whatever it was, you'd be able to just [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1401.1999999999998s)]
*  completely take the wind out of the sails. I think we're still [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1404.08s)]
*  getting only a controlled dribble of information and access to the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1408.36s)]
*  President of the United States. So he's going to be on [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1413.1999999999998s)]
*  Stephanopoulos, he's going to show up for a NATO meeting. And [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1415.96s)]
*  so you're only seeing drips and drabs of somebody who now a lot [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1419.52s)]
*  of people think is not in a position not just to run, but let [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1423.76s)]
*  alone run the country. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1427.08s)]
*  You said last week, Democratic Party will have a meaningful [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1428.1999999999998s)]
*  reset. So still thinking that, Shema? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1431.96s)]
*  The issue that the Democrats will have to face is the person [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1434.16s)]
*  that they probably want to run is someone different than [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1436.6000000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris. And the problem that they're going to have to [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1439.56s)]
*  confront is there's a part of it, which is fundraising. And I [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1442.92s)]
*  do think that David's right, there was an article in the FT [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1446.64s)]
*  where one of the op ed writers said they're in this sort of [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1448.92s)]
*  identity politics trap in sorts, because they will have to run [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1451.76s)]
*  her no matter what. And even if somebody did show up with the [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1455.72s)]
*  financial wherewithal, and I think Freeberg actually brings [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1459.12s)]
*  up a really interesting thought experiment. If there was [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1462.48s)]
*  somebody that could take the democratic mantle who could [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1465.52s)]
*  completely self fund their campaign, but he happened to be [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1467.8s)]
*  just a white man. What would the democrats do relative to [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1472.48s)]
*  Kamala Harris, and I think that they would be a knots around [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1477.0s)]
*  what to do [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1480.08s)]
*  because of the identity politics issue. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1480.6399999999999s)]
*  I think they have made it an important issue, this idea of [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1482.68s)]
*  inclusiveness as they've defined it. Got it. So it sets [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1486.04s)]
*  up for I think, a very complicated summer. Yeah. The [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1489.56s)]
*  other thing you have to keep in mind is how the electoral [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1493.08s)]
*  college works and how the ballot system works is that you don't [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1495.12s)]
*  have infinite time, you have to get all of this wrapped up and [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1498.28s)]
*  cinched up by the middle of August at the latest. And so [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1500.96s)]
*  we're very much on like a four or six week shot clock. And I [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1506.0s)]
*  don't think the democrats are doing what they need to do in [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1509.1599999999999s)]
*  order to completely take the wind out of the sails of this [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1514.24s)]
*  narrative that Biden is not prepared or capable. And the [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1517.2s)]
*  only way that you can do that is by having him appear 24 by seven [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1520.84s)]
*  in real time, in front of hundreds of millions of people [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1524.92s)]
*  as often as possible. And they're just not so since [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1527.94s)]
*  they're not doing it, they have ample time to do it. He's Yeah, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1530.4s)]
*  he's he's obviously by the way, the other the other problem that [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1534.0s)]
*  it creates is that you're starting to see some of these [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1536.44s)]
*  fissures inside of the team, there was a really charged [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1539.24s)]
*  article from Axios that dropped, which basically said that there [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1542.36s)]
*  are three people that have cordoned off access to the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1546.04s)]
*  president didn't named Yeah, that was real Biden and Thomas [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1548.32s)]
*  Heaney and some other person. And my initial thought when I [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1551.36s)]
*  read this was other than Joe Biden, who's a recognizable [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1554.04s)]
*  person, I had no idea who these other two people were. And I [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1556.52s)]
*  thought that's really precise for somebody like that, who has [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1559.4199999999998s)]
*  inside access to all of these sort of insiders to put that [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1564.04s)]
*  article up. So I think you're starting to see the sort of [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1567.4799999999998s)]
*  leaks in the fissures. Yeah. And then that's sort of this next [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1571.24s)]
*  phase that will make things a little bit ugly and contorted. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1574.52s)]
*  Let me ask one question here, because we got we had to move [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1576.88s)]
*  on to the Supreme Court stuff. Sax two poor question one, is [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1578.76s)]
*  there a chance that he has had a diagnosis already, and they're [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1584.24s)]
*  covering that up? And two, if they covered up something like [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1587.44s)]
*  that? What is the ramification of it? Because it's clear to [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1591.48s)]
*  everybody. He's in cognitive decline. It's clear it's been a [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1596.88s)]
*  couple of years of cognitive decline. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1599.76s)]
*  No, no, that was asked of KJP in a press conference yesterday. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1601.48s)]
*  She was very explicit. No. And the reason [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1605.72s)]
*  know that she doesn't know she doesn't know. No, no, no. The [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1607.84s)]
*  answer was much more explicit. Has he been diagnosed? And she [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1611.48s)]
*  said no. And the reason she said no is because that is very [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1614.08s)]
*  credible for her to say because he hasn't taken the tests. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1617.72s)]
*  Okay, so that's your [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1620.92s)]
*  look, it was obvious now for months, if not years, that [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1621.76s)]
*  there's been a huge cover up of his cognitive decline. And the [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1625.56s)]
*  media has participated in this anyone who raised that question [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1628.92s)]
*  was treated as being a partisan or a liar. And just for a good [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1632.68s)]
*  example of this, I know you described George Stephanopoulos [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1636.0800000000002s)]
*  as a straight shooter. But when Nikki Haley was on his show a [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1639.3600000000001s)]
*  few months ago, and I'm not a fan of Nikki Haley at all, but [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1642.52s)]
*  she started making this point. And Stephanopoulos basically [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1645.44s)]
*  wouldn't let her finish. I mean, basically, shouted her down. So [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1648.48s)]
*  the media was actively suppressing the story. You take [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1651.76s)]
*  Morning Joe, a Scarsborough, he was saying that this version of [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1655.1200000000001s)]
*  Biden is the best he's ever been. And we've been hearing all [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1658.36s)]
*  of that kind of stuff for months. They were describing true [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1660.8s)]
*  videos showing Biden being out of it. They were describing [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1663.8s)]
*  those as being fakes, clean fakes. They invented this new [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1667.4799999999998s)]
*  term for perfectly real videos that basically would reflect his [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1670.6799999999998s)]
*  condition. So the media has been engaged in a gigantic cover up [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1674.56s)]
*  of this. And as a result, the country is in really bad shape. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1677.4399999999998s)]
*  Because we have to go through the next six months either with [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1682.04s)]
*  a senile president who has limited cognition, or we could [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1685.56s)]
*  end up with a new president who was untested, inexperienced. And [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1689.84s)]
*  based on every interview she's given in the last four years, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1695.28s)]
*  appears to be completely clueless at a moment in time [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1697.8s)]
*  where I think we have the most dangerous foreign policy [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1701.24s)]
*  situation since the Cuban Missile Crisis. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1703.24s)]
*  This is a really horrible situation. And hold on, it's the [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1707.04s)]
*  media bears a lot of responsibility. And what should [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1710.08s)]
*  have happened? Okay, what should have happened is we should [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1712.88s)]
*  have had a robust Democratic primary a year ago. Sure. They [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1715.64s)]
*  saw concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities reported by [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1720.4s)]
*  an honest media. We never had that. Yeah. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1724.72s)]
*  So you guys see this clip, by the way, there's a clip on [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1727.2s)]
*  Twitter, where somebody put together a clip on next six [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1729.88s)]
*  minutes of 100 sort of spokespeople and proxies. And [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1733.3200000000002s)]
*  they all had the same thing to say about President Biden, which [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1739.96s)]
*  is he is sharp as a tack. Sharp as a tack. Which end of the [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1742.2s)]
*  tack the round part? What was so funny to me is I thought to [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1746.68s)]
*  myself, if I asked 100 people on the street, what do you think [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1749.52s)]
*  of Elon Musk, you'd have 100 different statements, there'd be [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1753.4s)]
*  a general theme. But you would not have even 50 people repeat [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1756.72s)]
*  the exact same words. And so you have this funny situation where [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1761.2s)]
*  100 different people were basically saying the exact same [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1766.0s)]
*  talking point. So it's not even a point of view. It was just [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1768.8s)]
*  something that they were told to say by somebody else. And that's [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1771.96s)]
*  your point. Both sides. Saks is the real issue, which is that [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1774.96s)]
*  you don't really have an honest media here. And so there is no [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1777.6399999999999s)]
*  check and balance on power right now. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1781.12s)]
*  Imagine if this feeding frenzy happened a year ago. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1782.84s)]
*  Well, the contrast and compare I want to make is everybody has a [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1785.48s)]
*  point of view about Donald Trump. And I was thinking about [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1788.6s)]
*  this. The reason why everybody has a point of view about Donald [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1791.56s)]
*  Trump is everything that has happened in his life is [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1793.96s)]
*  completely transparently documented. There really is [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1797.56s)]
*  nothing hidden at this point. And so you have a point of view [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1800.48s)]
*  because you've been given all of the stuff, right, and there's [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1803.6799999999998s)]
*  endless amounts of new stuff that come out about the old stuff. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1808.6399999999999s)]
*  And so you know, and that's what's so interesting, you have [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1812.1599999999999s)]
*  the ability to come to your own decision, and it's not packaged [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1815.84s)]
*  through these filters. Yet with President Biden, I think it's so [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1818.96s)]
*  constrained and controlled. And I think you have to understand [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1822.2s)]
*  and appreciate that cognitive decline, let's assume that he [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1826.48s)]
*  isn't for the sake of the United States. But if he is in it, it [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1830.1200000000001s)]
*  only gets worse from here. And it compounds and compounds and [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1833.76s)]
*  compounds. That is what happens. And so not only do you have to [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1836.88s)]
*  wonder what the next five months are like, what does it look like [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1840.32s)]
*  in 18 and 24 and 36 months? That is a really important issue [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1843.64s)]
*  here. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1848.68s)]
*  Clearly, Biden can't serve a second term. But the question is, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1849.04s)]
*  what what do we do now? And I gotta say, it's amazing to me [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1851.6s)]
*  that the Democrats are not considering the one option that [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1855.96s)]
*  is kind of obvious, which is you let the man run the most [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1860.52s)]
*  dignified campaign he can. He's the candidate you chose and [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1864.0s)]
*  oh, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1868.16s)]
*  satire, sex is back here. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1868.3600000000001s)]
*  It's not satire. This is not satire, sex. The real problem [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1869.64s)]
*  here is the Democrats refuse to lose. They want to cling to [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1873.64s)]
*  power. However, they can't they refuse to let democracy just [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1877.56s)]
*  work democracy working would be to do the speed run. I have a [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1881.48s)]
*  question. What would you do with the money? Would you just not [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1884.52s)]
*  spend it then? And just save it? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1886.4s)]
*  Well, this is really interesting. So there is an [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1888.32s)]
*  analog. Okay, in 1996, Bob Dole was the Republican candidate for [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1890.44s)]
*  president. And quite frankly, he was too old. He was seen as a [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1895.36s)]
*  relic. Clinton was fairly popular. And it was pretty [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1898.48s)]
*  obvious that he was just a loser and he was going to lose. The [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1902.04s)]
*  Republicans engage in shenanigans to try and fix the [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1904.8s)]
*  situation. No, they just accepted the inevitable that [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1907.96s)]
*  Dole was going to lose. And what they did is they pulled financing [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1910.8799999999999s)]
*  from his campaign, at least in the final month, and they [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1914.24s)]
*  redistributed it to House and Senate candidates. And actually, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1917.28s)]
*  they did better in the House and Senate, they held on to the [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1920.32s)]
*  House and Senate. I think they lost a few seats, but way less [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1923.56s)]
*  than they were expecting to. And they kind of ran on a campaign [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1926.8s)]
*  that, you know, you can't trust slick Willy. So keep us on split [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1929.48s)]
*  the ticket and keep us on as a check against him. And it [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1934.84s)]
*  actually worked fairly well. It was the best Republicans could [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1938.72s)]
*  do. But frankly, they let Bob Dole run a dignified campaign. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1941.0s)]
*  My advice to the Democrats would be don't have Biden resign and [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1945.2s)]
*  doing a shakeup. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1948.48s)]
*  Listen to Sax. There's your political counsel. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1950.6s)]
*  Right now, when you put an untested, unexperienced, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1955.08s)]
*  clueless president in there, he's gonna want to show how [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1958.6s)]
*  tough she is and bring in her own team. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1961.2s)]
*  Of this dangerous situation, let Biden run a dignified campaign [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1963.92s)]
*  and lose. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1967.6s)]
*  My advice to the Democrats is to embrace an outsider. Give the [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1968.4s)]
*  people what they want, freedom of choice, freedom to elect a [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1972.84s)]
*  leader, and bring someone in that falls outside of the [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1978.32s)]
*  traditional political spectrum that does not want to hold [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1981.76s)]
*  public office, because it's not their career. They can bring [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1984.68s)]
*  money to the table, they can bring credibility to the table, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1987.76s)]
*  and they can win votes and compete effectively against [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1990.2s)]
*  Trump. If your goal is to retain the White House, Kamala, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1992.8799999999999s)]
*  or just give us two names. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1996.84s)]
*  Give us two names. Jamie Diamond. Jamie Diamond. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=1998.12s)]
*  Bob, give us a second name. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2001.36s)]
*  Bob Iger. Yeah, it's great one. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2003.6399999999999s)]
*  Jamie, Bob Iger. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2004.96s)]
*  You know, another great one. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2006.52s)]
*  It's called wish casting. You're doing wish casting. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2008.68s)]
*  Sax, I'm not speaking about realism. I'm speaking I'm [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2011.16s)]
*  speaking about what it would take to win. Yes, they actually [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2013.6399999999999s)]
*  want to have someone that could win a popular vote, someone that [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2016.44s)]
*  could actually win votes away from Trump, because you can't [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2019.4s)]
*  introduce someone like Whitmer or more this late in the season [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2021.76s)]
*  when no one in the United States knows who the heck this [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2025.48s)]
*  person is. When you have someone with credibility, with economic [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2027.48s)]
*  and business success, with executive authority, with capital [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2030.92s)]
*  and connections into the Democratic Party, but isn't part [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2034.96s)]
*  of the political machine that you and many others in the [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2037.28s)]
*  Democratic Party are now starting to hate. Let's go have [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2040.56s)]
*  an opportunity to actually win. Yes, they were smart. And they [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2043.44s)]
*  got their together, they would say, you know what, it's time [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2046.72s)]
*  for a change, just like the Republicans had to do when [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2048.6s)]
*  things use the Republican playbook. Brilliant, freeburg [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2051.04s)]
*  Okay, well, you guys better have a magic lamp with a genie in it, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2055.0s)]
*  because that's the only way this is gonna happen. Well, listen, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2057.96s)]
*  it's, I'm just trying to keep the show fresh. Okay, okay, here [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2060.84s)]
*  we go. Next topic. Final word. Here we go. I'm giving freeburg [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2063.8s)]
*  the final route. He had the best take I'm giving freeburg the [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2068.96s)]
*  final word. You're pulling your McNeil era. Absolutely. Yeah. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2073.1200000000003s)]
*  Okay, here we go. There were seven rulings in a bunch of [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2076.88s)]
*  SCOTUS activity over the last week. But these are really [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2079.0s)]
*  important, consequential decisions, we are going to talk [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2082.32s)]
*  about three of them. And I'm going to try to get through [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2085.6400000000003s)]
*  these quickly. Obviously, you could talk about these for hours [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2088.96s)]
*  and people will be, you know, doing case studies on them for a [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2092.56s)]
*  long time. But let me try to do this quickly. So we can get [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2095.48s)]
*  everybody's take on them. The first one I want to talk about [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2098.52s)]
*  is net choice. This is the content moderation cases that [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2100.6400000000003s)]
*  you may have heard of. There were two very controversial [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2104.0800000000004s)]
*  laws passed in Florida and Texas in 2021. In the wake of January [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2106.48s)]
*  6, the Florida law if you weren't aware of it, and I don't [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2110.72s)]
*  suspect most people are, would cover platforms with over 100 [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2114.48s)]
*  million monthly active users or 100 million in annual revenue. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2117.7999999999997s)]
*  In other words, they're targeting x YouTube, Facebook [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2121.2799999999997s)]
*  meta, those kinds of sites. And they would require those [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2124.24s)]
*  platforms to notify users if their posts are removed or [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2127.6s)]
*  altered. And the platforms would have to make general [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2130.16s)]
*  disclosures about their operations and policies in the [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2132.9199999999996s)]

*  users whose posts were removed and provide an explanation of [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2141.48s)]
*  why all that kind of stuff. Both of these laws were challenged [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2144.4s)]
*  in court in 2021. Just to give you an idea like why I think the [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2148.12s)]
*  conservatives were upset about this. Obviously, Trump being [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2152.8399999999997s)]
*  suspended indefinitely on Twitter, Facebook and other [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2157.52s)]
*  platforms or the labeling of content like we've seen on our [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2160.8399999999997s)]
*  own channel and YouTube. Net choice is a tech industry group [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2163.3599999999997s)]
*  includes Facebook and YouTube and the parent companies of [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2166.96s)]
*  those. And they sued to block these two laws. Justice Kagan, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2169.0s)]
*  a liberal wrote the unanimous decision obviously no [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2174.36s)]
*  dissensions here. And the majority held the editorial [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2176.84s)]
*  judgment and the curation of other people's speech is a [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2179.76s)]
*  unique expressive product of its own, which entitles it to first [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2181.8s)]
*  amendment protection. So just to give you an example, if you [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2185.92s)]
*  wanted to create a social network, we can't be anonymous [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2188.6800000000003s)]
*  like LinkedIn, you can do that if you want to do something like [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2191.04s)]
*  Twitter x and have anonymous accounts, you can do that as [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2193.1200000000003s)]
*  well. If you want to create a social network with adult [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2195.04s)]
*  content, you can do it. Or like Zuck is doing on threats. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2197.2799999999997s)]
*  Interestingly, they are downplaying political content, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2200.56s)]
*  obviously other platforms amplify political content. So [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2203.6s)]
*  let me add so the end of all this in terms of how the court [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2208.84s)]
*  handled it is they offered some guidance and sent the cases back [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2213.12s)]
*  to the lower courts to clarify a bunch of stuff. Just to keep [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2216.48s)]
*  this brief, Chamath, what are your thoughts on this? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2219.6s)]
*  Obviously, some of the ideas here, like letting users know [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2222.72s)]
*  why they were banned or why content was taken down, I think [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2227.7999999999997s)]
*  the overwhelming majority of users would like to have that. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2230.68s)]
*  But is this the government's role? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2233.2s)]
*  I'm not enough of a legal scholar to know the details of [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2235.7599999999998s)]
*  this case, except to say that when the entire court goes in [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2238.08s)]
*  one direction, it's probably because this never should have [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2243.7999999999997s)]
*  been brought to the court in the first place. And they're giving [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2247.8399999999997s)]
*  a very clear message, it wasn't even ideologically strained to [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2249.84s)]
*  figure out what the right answer should be. So, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2253.48s)]
*  Sax, obviously, your chosen party was the one who brought [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2256.2400000000002s)]
*  this you have concerns about the platforms doing this. But do you [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2259.92s)]
*  have equal concerns about the government then I guess, being [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2263.04s)]
*  the ones who have to enforce these? Is this a good ruling? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2266.28s)]
*  Well, I think that with respect to the Texas and Florida laws, I [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2271.1600000000003s)]
*  think their heart was in the right place. They were motivated [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2274.88s)]
*  by the right things, which was to reduce censorship on the [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2277.2s)]
*  social media platforms, specifically censorship of [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2280.2799999999997s)]
*  conservatives, which is to say they're, they're citizens. But [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2282.7999999999997s)]
*  those laws probably were overly broad. And they infringed on the [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2287.04s)]
*  free speech of corporations. Because I guess corporations get [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2292.24s)]
*  free speech too. And basically, what the ruling says is that [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2295.64s)]
*  content moderation receives the same First Amendment protections [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2298.6s)]
*  as any other kind of speech. So the decisions of what content [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2301.92s)]
*  you're going to keep up or take down on your own property is [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2306.44s)]
*  itself a speech decision. And the government has to respect [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2311.7200000000003s)]
*  that. So that's what the ruling here was saying. I think it's not [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2314.52s)]
*  a bad decision. I wish the Supreme Court, however, had [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2317.64s)]
*  coupled this with a better decision in the Missouri versus [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2320.96s)]
*  Biden case, which they, they basically said that the plaintiffs [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2323.4s)]
*  lack standing to pursue. So they didn't necessarily give a [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2327.6s)]
*  dispositive ruling in that case. But they threw it, they threw it [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2331.44s)]
*  out. And yeah, and basically what that case was about was the [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2334.84s)]
*  Biden administration was engaged in attempts to influence or [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2338.44s)]
*  pressure social media companies to take down speech as a practice [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2342.1600000000003s)]
*  known as jawboning. And I wish they had coupled this decision [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2346.1600000000003s)]
*  with a better decision in in Missouri versus Biden saying the [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2351.1600000000003s)]
*  government's not allowed to coerce social networks to take [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2354.6000000000004s)]
*  down speech either. And they refuse to do that. So I wouldn't [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2357.6800000000003s)]
*  say these are like the greatest set of decisions with regard to [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2361.44s)]
*  free speech that the courts ever done. I hope that they will come [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2365.48s)]
*  back in the future. Once they find a plaintiff with the right [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2368.4s)]
*  standing to address that issue. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2371.92s)]
*  Yeah, that's key issue. Free burger of thoughts. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2373.96s)]
*  Yeah, so I've said for a long time, we've obviously had [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2376.32s)]
*  conversations about Twitter and shadow banning and some of the [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2379.0s)]
*  other activities on what are typically called social media [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2383.08s)]
*  platforms. At the end of the day, these are all as I've [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2385.76s)]
*  shared in the past, my belief is they're all content companies. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2388.68s)]
*  They have a choice as executives and its editors of those [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2391.64s)]
*  companies to decide how to editorialize the content on [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2396.08s)]
*  their platforms. They can choose to create content with writers [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2398.64s)]
*  that they pay on staff, like a newspaper might they can choose [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2401.96s)]
*  to create content with actors and directors that they pay to [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2405.44s)]
*  create novel video series for them like HBO might, or they can [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2407.76s)]
*  choose to make content creation available to third parties that [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2411.84s)]
*  don't get paid like users. And at the end of the day, what they [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2416.48s)]
*  choose to do with that content and how they choose to display [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2419.84s)]
*  that content is up to them as an editorial platform that is [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2422.32s)]
*  ultimately creating content for other consumers. I don't view [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2425.92s)]
*  that user generated content platforms are right of the [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2429.1200000000003s)]
*  consumers to have access to share their thoughts. They have [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2432.6800000000003s)]
*  the internet to do that. They have many other places that they [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2436.44s)]
*  can go to, to create blogs, to create websites to do whatever [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2438.76s)]
*  else they want to do to express themselves, but to have a [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2442.48s)]
*  technological platform that lets them submit content that then [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2445.2000000000003s)]
*  the editors get to decide how and where they show that content. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2448.8s)]
*  I think they should understand because it's in the terms and [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2452.0s)]
*  conditions when you sign up. So I don't believe in social media [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2453.84s)]
*  platforms as utilities. And I don't think that the government [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2456.84s)]
*  should have any role in deciding what is or isn't on those [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2459.88s)]
*  platforms. This goes both ways. I think that the company should [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2463.2400000000002s)]
*  decide what kind of platforms they want to have, whether they [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2466.6800000000003s)]
*  want to have free speech that allows inappropriate content, or [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2469.6800000000003s)]
*  content that might be offensive, or whether they want to have a [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2473.6000000000004s)]
*  highly moderated platform to make it more broadly available [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2476.36s)]
*  or appealing to users, it's entirely up to them. And I [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2479.0s)]
*  really do appreciate the ruling, because I think that the [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2481.92s)]
*  government should have less of a role in intervening and deciding [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2484.44s)]
*  how media companies create content and how they editorialize [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2487.08s)]
*  that content. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2489.44s)]
*  Yeah, so I think that's well said. And I was in the same sort [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2489.92s)]
*  of campus you freeburg, which is like a battle of snowflakes here [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2493.2400000000002s)]
*  like the liberals, obviously, we're canceling people on these [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2496.6s)]
*  platforms. And now like the bag of folks want to come in and [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2499.28s)]
*  have the government regulate it. If you want to compete here, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2501.8s)]
*  just create a new product or service in the market, you're on [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2504.96s)]
*  the board of rumble sacks, like they're doing really well. And [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2507.92s)]
*  if you squeeze too tight, and your platform doesn't work, it's [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2511.84s)]
*  the marketplace should, you know, figure out who the winners [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2514.28s)]
*  are. And you know, it's not a situation where you want the [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2517.12s)]
*  government getting in there, because then they're going to go [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2521.8s)]
*  to a newspaper. And there's so much precedent here, you know, I [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2524.2s)]
*  actually read some of the of these rulings, which is really [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2526.92s)]
*  interesting. They're written phenomenally well, I will put in [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2530.12s)]
*  the show notes, the actual links to the PDFs of these decisions, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2532.44s)]
*  they're well worth reading. And in this case, they brought up a [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2535.56s)]
*  bunch of the previous long, was fascinating, like people wanted [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2539.64s)]
*  to force a newspaper to allow, you know, one candidate to [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2543.52s)]
*  reply and give him space, they're like, No, you can't do [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2547.8s)]
*  that. It's their newspaper, they decide what they publish. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2550.56s)]
*  Another person wanted to have a corporate newsletter be forced to [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2552.92s)]
*  give information about the other sides, you just don't get to do [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2556.8s)]
*  that. I'll just say one more thing. What else is striking is [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2559.92s)]
*  just how insular and protection is Texas and Florida are being [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2562.4s)]
*  and it's not just with this law. It's also with the lab grown meat [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2566.36s)]
*  or cultivated meat laws that they've passed and other states [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2569.64s)]
*  are passing similar laws, which is limiting innovation in the [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2571.84s)]
*  state and limiting freedom to operate in the state in order to [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2575.0s)]
*  protect interests of individuals and corporations that already [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2578.0s)]
*  exist within that state. So it's really important to note, this [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2581.2400000000002s)]
*  isn't a good or a bad thing. But those states are operating in a [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2584.12s)]
*  way the lawmakers of those states are operating away, that's [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2587.44s)]
*  trying to protect the interests of the individuals and [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2589.92s)]
*  businesses in the state over the freedoms that might and the [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2592.12s)]
*  liberties that might otherwise be available. I think we often [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2595.24s)]
*  talk about these states being more free, but these laws and the [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2597.24s)]
*  cultivated meat ban laws, in my opinion, indicate that these [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2599.88s)]
*  states are actually on the contrary. They're much more kind [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2602.8399999999997s)]
*  of protectionist. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2606.3199999999997s)]
*  What's your take on that, Sax? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2607.0s)]
*  To Freeberg's point, I mean, I think this, this ruling might [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2608.2799999999997s)]
*  have been necessary from a constitutional standpoint, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2611.4s)]
*  because corporations do have free speech rights. But again, I [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2613.2799999999997s)]
*  would say that I think that the laws of Texas and Florida are [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2616.7999999999997s)]
*  coming from a good place, which is they were trying to protect [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2620.04s)]
*  the rights of their citizens to engage in free speech. I think [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2623.64s)]
*  it's just unfortunate that in this case, it's a zero sum game. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2626.56s)]
*  And as a result, those laws were were invalidated. I think that [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2630.16s)]
*  makes sense. But I still think we have a problem. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2633.36s)]
*  I agree with you, the platforms have too much power. What is [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2635.24s)]
*  your proposed solution? You obviously don't want to have the [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2638.2799999999997s)]
*  government in there like running a newsroom or running Twitter [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2641.24s)]
*  X because you yourself are saying, hey, the government's too [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2643.88s)]
*  involved in X and these platforms and doing this jaw [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2646.6s)]
*  boning. So obviously having them more involved is bad, right? [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2650.04s)]
*  You're against them being involved. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2653.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's really tricky to figure out how to solve this. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2655.08s)]
*  Got it. I think for one thing, you don't want the government [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2658.04s)]
*  jaw boning these sites to take down content that clearly should [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2661.44s)]
*  be a free speech violation. I'm disappointed the court didn't [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2664.04s)]
*  get to that. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2666.6s)]
*  I think we're totally missing the bigger picture. There's like a [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2667.12s)]
*  lot of fear mongering that I think has happened with [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2670.44s)]
*  respect to the Supreme Court, and that it's all of a sudden [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2673.96s)]
*  become some super ideological, super rigid, super activist [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2678.2s)]
*  place. And I think it's in fact, much of the opposite. And the [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2683.4s)]
*  data supports that. And so I think it's important for people [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2688.4s)]
*  to know that what's actually happening is that many of these [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2691.44s)]
*  decisions are very much split along non ideological lines. And [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2695.04s)]
*  I think that that's an important thing. So I just like I'm [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2700.2s)]
*  pulling this up. And I just want to read some of these [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2702.44s)]
*  things to you. US versus Rahimi, which is a federal law that [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2704.16s)]
*  prohibits people subjected to domestic violence, restraining [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2708.8s)]
*  orders from having a firearm. That was an eight to one [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2712.92s)]
*  decision where all but Thomas supported them makes a lot of [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2715.76s)]
*  sense, you would think racial gerrymandering that was more [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2718.84s)]
*  ideological, where was the conservative block versus Sotomayor [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2722.8s)]
*  Brown and Kagan, Trump v. Anderson, which is Trump getting [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2726.4s)]
*  back on the Colorado ballot 90. FDA versus the Alliance for [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2730.32s)]
*  Hippocratic Medicine, which was access to the abortion pill, 90 [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2736.84s)]
*  maintaining access. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2741.0s)]
*  Moyle versus us, which is whether Idaho's strict abortion [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2744.6000000000004s)]
*  law conflicts with the federal law, non ideological where it [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2748.0800000000004s)]
*  was Gorsuch, Alito, Thomas, and Katanji Brown Jackson who [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2751.6800000000003s)]
*  dissented. So it goes on and on. And I think what's so [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2755.2400000000002s)]
*  interesting about all of this is that I had thought that this [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2758.28s)]
*  was not like what it was. What I thought what had happened is [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2762.4s)]
*  Trump's track the Supreme Court, all of a sudden we are ripping [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2765.6000000000004s)]
*  all these laws apart, this long standing sort of doctrine of [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2768.6000000000004s)]
*  what has passed. But yet I think what's actually happening is [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2774.44s)]
*  people are pretty thoughtfully pushing the responsibility to [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2777.6800000000003s)]
*  the states. And I think that the court's decisions are relatively [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2782.4s)]
*  unpredictable in the sense that it's not just a conservative [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2787.0s)]
*  block versus a liberal block. I think that's the real story. And [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2789.68s)]
*  when you unpack a bunch of these decisions in that context, that's [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2793.12s)]
*  what's so interesting to me is like these are pretty nuanced [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2796.4s)]
*  decisions that get at the heart of a lot of key important issues [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2800.08s)]
*  happening across non ideological lines. Jan six one Katanji Brown [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2803.16s)]
*  Jackson was the Biden appointee that basically supported this [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2806.76s)]
*  thing that may throw out 200 plus convictions for Jan six. And [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2809.68s)]
*  Amy Coneybert was on the other side. This is an unpredictable [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2812.8s)]
*  Supreme Court. I think they think for themselves, they seem [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2815.28s)]
*  to be independent. And I think there are coming to their own [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2817.6400000000003s)]
*  conclusions. That's the only thing to take away from the [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2820.96s)]
*  distribution of the votes that should make people feel a little [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2823.1200000000003s)]
*  bit better. So I think this next ruling is the most important [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2825.96s)]
*  one. And I think will be the most important one that we've [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2829.0400000000004s)]
*  seen with this new court that has three of the nine justices [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2831.8s)]
*  placed by Trump to your point, Jamal. And this one is seismic, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2837.8s)]
*  the looper versus Raymundo decision overturn Chevron. Okay, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2842.2000000000003s)]
*  so this one takes a little explaining the court overruled a [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2846.2000000000003s)]
*  landmark 1984 decision in the Chevron case from 40 years ago. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2848.84s)]
*  For context, the original ruling created the Chevron doctrine [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2854.88s)]
*  where the government and federal courts generally defer to the [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2858.36s)]
*  stances of federal agencies unless Congress has written [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2861.6800000000003s)]
*  specific laws on an issue. The 1984 ruling upheld the EPA's [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2865.0s)]
*  interpretation of the Clean Air Act. It's very influential. This [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2868.76s)]
*  has been cited by federal courts over 18,000 times in 40 years. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2872.4s)]
*  It was overruled in another six to three decision where the [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2876.6000000000004s)]
*  justices voted along party lines. Basically, this shifts power [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2878.96s)]
*  back to federal judges and courts instead of administrative [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2882.7200000000003s)]
*  agency staff by experts, academics, all that kind of [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2885.4s)]
*  stuff. In the majority opinion, Roberts conservative, obviously, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2888.28s)]
*  said the Chevron doctrine violates the Administrative [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2893.44s)]
*  Procedures Act of Federal Law that directs the courts to [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2895.96s)]
*  review actions taken by federal agencies. He also pointed out [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2897.96s)]
*  the courts are regularly expected to deal with technical [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2900.48s)]
*  questions. So this should not be considered beyond their ability [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2902.64s)]
*  to scope. Kagan, a liberal wrote a critical dissent. She said the [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2904.96s)]
*  agency staff with scientists and experts are more likely to have [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2908.04s)]
*  the expertise to make these decisions rather than the [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2910.92s)]
*  judges. She also pointed out that the system had been [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2912.8s)]
*  functioning for 40 years. And this ruling will create a massive [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2916.12s)]
*  quote jolt to the legal system. Chamath get in there. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2919.2400000000002s)]
*  Do you remember when President Biden tried to pass the budget [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2922.28s)]
*  two years ago, and he was one vote short, and Joe Manchin [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2926.4s)]
*  ended up putting it over the top, but he negotiated what was [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2931.04s)]
*  a redo of a bunch of regulation. And he was promised that there [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2935.12s)]
*  would be this regulatory overhaul that happened. And [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2939.8s)]
*  that was sort of why he had decided to vote for that budget [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2942.7200000000003s)]
*  bill. It ended up not happening. So the reason why I think he [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2948.2400000000002s)]
*  had saw that and he discussed this is that there are so many [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2952.96s)]
*  businesses that now suffer from the regulations of these [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2955.72s)]
*  agencies. Because when the agency enacted that regulation, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2959.12s)]
*  it was just a different time and place. And there was no clean [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2963.12s)]
*  way to go back to an independent body and say, I understand what [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2967.08s)]
*  your intention was in 1985 when you wrote that regulation. But [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2972.3199999999997s)]
*  in 2024, things have changed. Can we reconsider? And basically [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2976.72s)]
*  what the courts have done now will allow companies who believe [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2982.48s)]
*  that regulations are either overwrought or misguided for [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2986.68s)]
*  today's market landscape, bring it to an independent judiciary [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2991.52s)]
*  and have them decide. And I think that that's a very [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2996.04s)]
*  reasonable check and balance. And I think that's that makes a [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=2998.88s)]
*  lot of sense. folks can pass laws. And if folks believe that [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3001.8s)]
*  those laws do you undo harm, now you have a mechanism to go and [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3005.2s)]
*  actually explain your case to somebody independent who can [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3009.8s)]
*  then make a judgment. I think that that's a good check and [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3012.7200000000003s)]
*  bounce. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3015.64s)]
*  Freeburg, I knew this was the one you most wanted to talk [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3016.16s)]
*  about. What's your take on this end of the age of experts? And [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3018.44s)]
*  throwing things back to the court? What will be the [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3023.8s)]
*  practical ramifications of this? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3025.88s)]
*  How much experience you guys have had dealing with federal [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3028.16s)]
*  regulators? You have a lot more than I think, yeah. And I've [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3032.7200000000003s)]
*  worked in a lot across a number of federal agencies in [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3036.72s)]
*  businesses I've been involved in. And I can tell you it is, as [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3040.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm sure you would expect, there's a lot of bureaucratic [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3044.8399999999997s)]
*  morass in these agencies. And if you think about it, it's [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3047.16s)]
*  because the agencies are effectively under the Chevron [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3051.2s)]
*  doctrine, vested, unlimited authority to create rules and [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3054.3199999999997s)]
*  regulations that they then determine are meant to represent [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3059.2s)]
*  the laws that were passed by Congress. But more often than [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3063.6s)]
*  not, those rules and regulations begin to bleed outside of the [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3067.4s)]
*  lines of the intention of the laws when they were passed. And [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3071.36s)]
*  this is because those agencies by creating new rules and [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3076.16s)]
*  regulations, this isn't this isn't some like, you know, I [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3079.36s)]
*  have a subversive reason for doing this, but these agencies [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3083.7999999999997s)]
*  have an incentive for creating more rules and regulations [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3086.88s)]
*  because they then get to go back to Congress and ask for more [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3090.3199999999997s)]
*  budget and hire more people and grow the importance and the [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3093.52s)]
*  scale of their agency. This is the natural kind of organic [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3097.8s)]
*  growth that arises in any living system. And any organization of [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3101.44s)]
*  individuals is also a living system and has the same [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3105.84s)]
*  incentive. It wants to have more resources, it wants to get [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3108.72s)]
*  bigger, it wants to do more stuff, it wants to be more [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3111.72s)]
*  important. And the Chevron doctrine has allowed agencies to [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3114.24s)]
*  operate independent and outside of the lines that were defined [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3118.16s)]
*  in the laws that were passed, that that then vested them this [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3121.84s)]
*  authority, that then they can go and say, I want more budget, I [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3125.1600000000003s)]
*  want to get bigger. And I'm optimistic that this ruling will [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3127.84s)]
*  limit the agency's authorities and limit their ability to [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3132.6800000000003s)]
*  create more bureaucratic overhead, more headcount, more [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3135.76s)]
*  individuals that need to now go and administer the rules and [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3140.08s)]
*  regulations that they themselves create. And so I'm actually very [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3143.7200000000003s)]
*  optimistic and hopeful about this, this change. Now the [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3147.52s)]
*  downside, the negative to this is that there are a number of [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3150.64s)]
*  really important regulatory roles that agencies have come to [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3154.48s)]
*  play that never got passed as bills, like environmental [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3158.7599999999998s)]
*  protection rules. And there's a negative consequence that will [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3162.16s)]
*  arise to some degree, with respect to help of the [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3166.3199999999997s)]
*  environment, health of people, etc. But I think net net, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3168.7999999999997s)]
*  Congress needs to do its job, it needs to go back to session, and [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3171.8799999999997s)]
*  it needs to sit down and needs to pass laws that really clearly [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3175.8399999999997s)]
*  define what is and what isn't going to be legal going forward. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3178.32s)]
*  And then the agencies operate strictly within those bounds. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3181.8s)]
*  So to recap, it could get a little messy, but it's a better, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3184.88s)]
*  healthier system, because this system has become super bloated [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3188.0800000000004s)]
*  over 40 years. That was my take on it as well. Sax, what's your [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3191.4s)]
*  take on this? This feels like a huge win to me. What do you [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3195.1200000000003s)]
*  know? [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3198.6400000000003s)]
*  Oh, I agree with that. And I agree with what Friedberg said, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3199.44s)]
*  look, when when this decision, the Chevron decision came down in [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3201.6800000000003s)]
*  1984, at the height of the Reagan revolution, conservatives [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3204.8s)]
*  actually liked it, they praised it because we were coming off a [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3208.32s)]
*  period of an activist court, you know, the Warren Court, and [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3211.88s)]
*  they thought that shifting power from the courts, the agencies [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3216.52s)]
*  would actually be a good move. Well, it turns out it completely [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3219.48s)]
*  backfired. Whichever one when it came out was not a widely [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3221.88s)]
*  noticed decision since then has been cited 18,000 times by [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3225.48s)]
*  federal courts has turned out to be enormously important and [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3229.6000000000004s)]
*  influential. And the reason for all those citations is it's the [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3232.6s)]
*  courts deferring to the rulemaking of an agency, you [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3236.2799999999997s)]
*  know, what Chevron basically says is, as long as the agency's [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3239.7599999999998s)]
*  interpretation is reasonable, or you could say not unreasonable, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3243.04s)]
*  then the agency can basically promulgate the rule. And what [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3246.92s)]
*  this has led to is an orgy of rulemaking by all these federal [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3250.0s)]
*  agencies. And so most of our laws now effectively are being [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3253.72s)]
*  made by unelected bureaucrats who are part of this three [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3258.92s)]
*  letter alphabet soup of government agencies. It's not the [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3262.52s)]
*  Congress, it's not the court, it's not the president, it's this [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3265.2000000000003s)]
*  fourth branch of government that's not in the Constitution, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3268.2400000000002s)]
*  which is the administrative state. And so the administrative [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3271.0s)]
*  state has become incredibly powerful as a result of Chevron [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3274.48s)]
*  doctrine. And now I think, by reversing it, you actually give [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3277.64s)]
*  a chance for the restoration of democracy. Basically, the [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3281.08s)]
*  agencies are not empowered to essentially make whatever rules [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3285.08s)]
*  they want as long as they superficially appear reasonable, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3288.52s)]
*  they actually have to show that their rules are within a statue [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3291.48s)]
*  that they that they were directed by Congress to [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3296.36s)]
*  effectively engage in the rulemaking. So this is a step in [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3298.6s)]
*  the right direction for sure. But again, the real problem here [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3301.32s)]
*  is reigning in this unelected administrative state. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3303.72s)]
*  Yeah, so any final thoughts here as we move on to the next one? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3306.64s)]
*  Seems like the Supreme Court is doing a great job. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3311.84s)]
*  I agree. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3314.84s)]
*  All nine of them. I mean, they really, they really seem to be [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3315.6s)]
*  doing a tremendous job. I give them a lot of credit. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3318.7599999999998s)]
*  I feel like I've become a conservative. Maybe I'm a [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3323.0s)]
*  conservative now, sacks. I don't know, I may have to sit down [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3325.4s)]
*  and confess to you. Because I read a number of these decisions. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3328.24s)]
*  And I was like, I agree, I agree. And this is supposed to be a [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3331.3199999999997s)]
*  conservative court. So I'm not sure. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3333.4s)]
*  Well, it's actually it's not, it's not an originalist court. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3335.52s)]
*  It's not a conservative court. This is what I'm saying. Like, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3338.64s)]
*  these are words that are planted by people that want you to [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3340.6s)]
*  believe their version of the lie. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3343.44s)]
*  Great point. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3346.6s)]
*  There are a lot of originalists on the court. And what the [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3347.16s)]
*  originalist doctrine says, and sacks, you can correct me is I [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3350.04s)]
*  read the Constitution with faith and fidelity, and I just see [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3353.28s)]
*  what it's what it says, not I interpret it, not I fill in the [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3356.76s)]
*  words, I just what it says is what we're allowed. And I think [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3360.76s)]
*  that there's some, there's a really good version of America [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3364.4s)]
*  in that view of the world. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3368.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I would say it's not even necessarily an [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3370.36s)]
*  originalist or conservative court. It's a 333 court, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3372.64s)]
*  meaning there's three conservatives, there's three [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3375.56s)]
*  liberals, and there's three justice in the middle, you have [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3377.12s)]
*  this middle block, led by the Chief Justice Roberts with [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3379.68s)]
*  Kavanaugh and Barrett, and then you got the conservatives with [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3382.44s)]
*  Gorsuch and Thomas and Alito. And sometimes the middle block [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3385.72s)]
*  goes with the liberal science that goes with the [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3390.48s)]
*  conservatives. Again, it's more of a like a triangle. And as we [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3391.8799999999997s)]
*  know, the triangle is the best shape for equipoise, right, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3395.48s)]
*  because it creates balance. And I think what we have right now [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3398.44s)]
*  is a balanced court. And I think on the whole, they've done a [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3401.16s)]
*  good job. And I think it's kind of sad that in reaction to some [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3403.52s)]
*  of these decisions, you've got powerful lawmakers like [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3407.56s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren, who are explicitly calling for packing [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3410.3999999999996s)]
*  the court. They're actually saying, you know, put a bunch [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3413.3599999999997s)]
*  of justice on here to ruin this equipoise that we have. I think [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3415.8399999999997s)]
*  it's really sad. I think that the court right now is one of [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3419.7999999999997s)]
*  the last highly functional institutions in American public [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3422.08s)]
*  life. And for elected leaders to be calling for its destruction [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3425.64s)]
*  is just sad. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3429.48s)]
*  Well, I you know, I think what here and here's an image from [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3431.44s)]
*  Axio showing, you know, six Republican nominated and three [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3434.48s)]
*  Democrat nominated, I think, to give the counter argument, you [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3438.68s)]
*  know, Roe v. Wade, being overturned was something the [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3442.44s)]
*  majority of the country didn't want. These three people were [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3445.6s)]
*  added for that explicit purpose by Trump, people have trauma, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3448.2s)]
*  pain over that reasonably, I think. And then the truth is, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3453.32s)]
*  though, if they are, you know, just one standard deviation here, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3457.52s)]
*  as you can see in this Axios chart, which is based on some [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3461.72s)]
*  data, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3465.48s)]
*  I don't I don't trust this chart. I think this chart is [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3466.68s)]
*  worthless. Jason, I think well, let me explain to you what is [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3468.96s)]

*  don't even know what it is. Yeah, if you look at it, my point [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3473.8s)]
*  is, this is meaningless. A child could have drawn this. It [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3477.28s)]
*  means nothing. No, no, a child didn't draw it. She'm off. This [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3479.12s)]
*  was how do you know? I'm reading, I'm reading the source [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3481.64s)]
*  of the data. This is based on something called the Martin Quinn [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3485.92s)]
*  score and analysis by political scientists, Andrew Martin, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3488.6800000000003s)]
*  Kevin Quinn. Notice the Martin Quinn score places judges on an [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3491.44s)]
*  ideal lecture, ideological spectrum, a lower score [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3494.88s)]

*  indicates a more conservative justice. And then they went [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3500.1600000000003s)]
*  through all of their decisions. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3503.44s)]

*  now regressiating the score like it means something. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3511.88s)]
*  No, I think it's an interesting way. It's an interesting chart [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3514.3599999999997s)]
*  to discuss to understand a little bit of their meanings. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3517.8399999999997s)]
*  What I would encourage anybody to do is to look at the actual [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3520.64s)]
*  substance of the decisions. And the votes and what you will see [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3524.7599999999998s)]
*  is that people are not as easily predictable as that chart would [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3529.0s)]
*  show. And I think that's what's important. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3532.4399999999996s)]
*  Okay. I think that chart supports exactly what you just [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3535.6s)]
*  said, Sax, right? Yeah. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3541.2s)]
*  I mean, not exactly. I mean, again, I view it as a 333 [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3544.3999999999996s)]
*  court. A lot of other people have written about that. And [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3547.3199999999997s)]
*  they've got their own diagrams and charts to show that look, I [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3549.3999999999996s)]
*  think it's a court like I said, in equipoise, I don't think it's [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3551.8399999999997s)]
*  partisan. I think it's it's being reasonably fair. I don't [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3555.06s)]
*  agree with every single ruling. Like I said, I would have liked [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3558.64s)]
*  to have seen a different result in Biden v Missouri. However, I [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3561.4399999999996s)]
*  think on the whole, they're doing a good job. And it really [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3565.48s)]
*  should be a scandal that you've got powerful lawmakers, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3567.08s)]
*  explicitly calling for the court to be packed. I mean, that would [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3571.08s)]
*  be a disaster, right? Because you have nine justices, which is [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3574.64s)]
*  a good number, you try to increase that to 13. Then the [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3576.88s)]
*  next time the Republicans have control, they're going to [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3580.08s)]
*  increase it to 15 or 21 or whatever, and pretty soon we're [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3581.88s)]
*  gonna have 100 justices on the court, you'll ruin it. You know, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3585.2s)]
*  really, nine justices should be a constitutional requirement, we [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3588.52s)]
*  should just fix it at nine and not mess with that. So it's just [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3591.48s)]
*  scandalous to me that you've got politicians who are reacting to [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3595.7999999999997s)]
*  reasonable decisions by saying that we need to pack the court. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3600.0s)]

*  the Ricks cabaret stock price is that it has presaged the last [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3724.1600000000003s)]

*  result, Ricks cabaret is more likely down because of only [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3784.0s)]
*  fans and the lack of [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3786.76s)]
*  shall we say employee base available to work in these [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3790.6000000000004s)]
*  establishments because they make more money working online [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3794.64s)]
*  at only fans now. That was a theory post posited by one of [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3796.96s)]
*  our good friends. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3800.8399999999997s)]
*  But you kind of think that that showed up in the data at least a [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3801.72s)]
*  year two years ago now. Because how long is only fans been [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3804.6s)]
*  around a long time, I'm guessing. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3808.12s)]
*  Well, but I think it peaked during COVID because you know, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3809.2s)]
*  you couldn't go to a cabaret if you wanted to take in a cabaret [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3812.3199999999997s)]
*  show and have a you know, a bottle of champagne at a cabaret [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3815.16s)]
*  show, you can do it. So you're the thesis of our friend is the [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3820.08s)]
*  thesis of our friend, like entertainers. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3825.08s)]
*  Yeah, only fans took all the entertainers out of the strip [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3827.28s)]
*  club industry because they make more money online cabaret cabaret [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3830.92s)]
*  industry, the cabaret industry, I'm sorry, please edit that Nick. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3833.8s)]
*  And as a result, the quality of the product at the cabaret [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3837.4s)]
*  business has declined. And as a result, revenue has declined, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3841.28s)]
*  it took a little bit of time to earn that in. So the virtual [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3844.48s)]
*  cabaret industry, that's our friends theory, we give them a [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3846.92s)]
*  big shout out, we will. Yeah. Shout out to call it the beep [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3849.44s)]
*  theory. Yeah, the beep theory. So the the elite cabaret artists [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3853.76s)]
*  can make more money on only fans that go there. And then that [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3858.56s)]
*  leaves the less refined artists. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3862.52s)]
*  Why it's so good. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3868.56s)]

*  The paper company where they work. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3923.68s)]
*  Apparently, we've had a huge victory for Trump in the [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3926.36s)]
*  immunity case. Trump sued in this case based on special [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3928.84s)]
*  counsel, Jack Smith's prosecution of Trump for [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3932.96s)]
*  alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election and his role in [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3936.76s)]
*  January six. If you don't remember that case, since there's [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3940.76s)]
*  so many cases against Trump. This was based on Trump [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3944.6s)]
*  pressuring Mike Pence to not certify the election his phone [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3948.0s)]
*  call to get the 11,780 votes that were missing in Georgia. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3950.76s)]
*  Or Giuliani and the WAC PAC trying to fake electorates to [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3956.04s)]
*  overturn the election. Trump argued that he should be immune [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3959.64s)]
*  from prosecution for acts committed while he was [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3963.44s)]
*  president. So go to ruled six three along party lines, that [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3966.28s)]
*  former presidents can't face prosecution for actions that [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3971.08s)]
*  related to core powers of their office, office, and official [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3974.36s)]
*  official, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3979.8s)]
*  what are the core powers of their office and that all [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3980.6400000000003s)]
*  official acts receive at least the broad presumption of [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3984.84s)]
*  immunity. Here's the quote under our constitutional structure of [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3988.8s)]
*  separated powers, the nature of presidential power entitles [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3991.96s)]
*  former president to absolute immunity for criminal [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3995.1200000000003s)]
*  prosecution for actions within his conclusive and reclusive [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=3998.08s)]
*  constitutional authority and he is entitled to at least [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4002.4s)]
*  presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4005.32s)]
*  acts, there is no immunity for unofficial acts that would be [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4008.92s)]
*  outside the duty of the president's chief justice, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4012.4s)]
*  Roberts emphasize that decision that the decision doesn't [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4016.0s)]
*  necessarily mean presidents are above the law. In her dissenting [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4019.2000000000003s)]
*  opinion, Justice Sotomayor wrote that under the new rule in [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4022.7200000000003s)]
*  criminal law can't be applied to presidents even if they misuse [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4026.7200000000003s)]
*  their office for personal gain. She wrote that if the president [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4030.52s)]
*  orders the Navy SEAL Team six to assassinate a political rival, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4033.2400000000002s)]
*  he is now insulated from criminal prosecution. Another [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4036.52s)]
*  quote, the president is now a king above the law. She closed [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4039.2s)]
*  with this line, with fear for our democracy, a dissent, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4042.68s)]
*  notably this breaks the tradition of closing with a [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4046.4s)]
*  respectfully dissent. So Trump's attempts to overturn the election [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4048.36s)]
*  results case now hinges on whether Trump's conduct was [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4051.8s)]
*  private, or related to his official duty. For example, the [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4054.92s)]
*  lower courts now have to determine when Trump pressured [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4060.0s)]
*  Pence to not certify the election if that was an official [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4062.76s)]
*  business of being president or not, or when he called Georgia [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4065.92s)]
*  and said, Hey, can you find me 11,000 votes? Was that official [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4070.2400000000002s)]
*  duty or was it outside his duty? President Trump has already [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4073.48s)]
*  cited the immunity ruling and requesting a New York judge [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4077.28s)]
*  throw out his conviction in the hush money case. Sentencing for [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4080.08s)]
*  that was pushed back from July 11 to September because of this [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4084.2000000000003s)]
*  ruling. Sax, there's your wrong. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4087.52s)]
*  Well, Jacob, what do you think? This is I'm really curious. I [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4090.28s)]
*  mean, I read the the I'm halfway through the the original PDF. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4094.12s)]
*  And I do think the president needs immunity, obviously for [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4100.36s)]
*  conducting business. And then I do think if they step outside [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4104.96s)]
*  the lines, they should not have immunity, and then the devil [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4108.72s)]
*  will be in the details here. And that's what courts and juries [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4113.04s)]
*  exist to do. So when I told Mike Pence to not certify the [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4116.5599999999995s)]
*  election, he's obviously not doing that as part of his duty [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4120.12s)]
*  as president when he called Georgia to get the 11,000 votes, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4124.84s)]
*  he was not doing that. That's why he had outside counsel there. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4128.12s)]
*  That's why he hired Giuliani and the whack. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4131.08s)]
*  What do you think? What do you think of Sotomayor's hypothetical [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4133.48s)]
*  of using SEAL Team six to kill a political rival? Well, I thought [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4136.36s)]
*  that's, you think that he would be immune from process, anybody [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4140.28s)]
*  would be immune from prosecution for that? [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4143.28s)]
*  No, that seemed a little bit hysterical. And actually, that [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4145.2s)]
*  came up in the discussions. I actually listened to the audio [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4147.96s)]
*  version of this when they were doing the the q&a basically. And [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4152.4s)]
*  I think you listened to it too, free break when I talked about [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4156.32s)]
*  it. So yeah, I think the devil will be in the details here and [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4158.28s)]
*  how they execute it. Obviously, you need to have immunity if [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4161.6s)]
*  you're going to I don't know, take actions, you know, to [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4165.32s)]
*  assassinate Osama bin Laden, right, or whatever it is. But [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4168.4s)]
*  you know, it's it is a bit concerning this concept of being [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4172.76s)]
*  able to shield the president when he asks, I don't know, the [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4176.76s)]
*  attorney general to do something illegal. So these are the [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4181.68s)]
*  details that are going to need to be worked out here. And [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4184.360000000001s)]
*  obviously, it's a split decision. So the Supreme Court [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4186.56s)]
*  themselves can't agree on this. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4189.2s)]
*  I think that there's just so much we don't know about what it [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4190.68s)]
*  takes to be the President of the United States. The example that [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4193.12s)]
*  I gave you guys in the group chat is like, look at the whole [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4195.4800000000005s)]
*  Iran Contra affair. How complicated was that? Can any of [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4197.64s)]
*  us really understand what all of the interplay was when Ronald [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4201.6s)]
*  Reagan decides to work around a weapons embargo, sell weapons to [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4205.2s)]
*  Iran, take money, funnel it and fund the sand and east does in [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4210.72s)]
*  the middle of all of that there was a huge cocaine trade that [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4216.4s)]
*  was kind of enabled or supported. I mean, who how do we [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4218.72s)]
*  know? I think there's just a lot of latitude that you give to the [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4223.48s)]
*  one person that you elect to be president. And so maybe it's just [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4227.76s)]
*  a good reminder for all of us that we are electing one person, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4231.08s)]
*  we cannot be electing five or six people, we're not electing a [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4234.0s)]
*  shadow cabinet, we're electing one person. And this is just a [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4237.0s)]
*  reminder of how much power that one person has. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4240.44s)]
*  Sack, do you have thoughts? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4244.28s)]
*  I think this was an easy decision. All the majority did [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4246.72s)]
*  was codify explicitly what has long been presumed that [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4249.64s)]
*  presidents enjoy broad immunity for official acts that they [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4253.56s)]
*  undertake in the exercise of their constitutional authority [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4257.84s)]
*  and the duties of their office. It was established decades ago [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4260.84s)]
*  that presidents enjoy broad immunity from civil lawsuits. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4264.96s)]
*  So it's already been the case that presidents can't be sued [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4268.32s)]
*  civilly. Well, criminal liability is even harder to [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4271.28s)]
*  prove. So if you have the broad immunity from civil, you should [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4275.360000000001s)]
*  have broad immunity from criminal as well. And the [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4278.72s)]
*  Supreme Court, I think had never ruled on criminal immunity [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4282.08s)]
*  because they never had to. No former presidents ever been [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4284.64s)]
*  subjected to the type of lawfare that's been deployed against [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4287.08s)]
*  Trump, who also happens to be the political opponent of the [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4290.04s)]
*  current president. So I think it's a shame that the Supreme [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4292.8s)]
*  Court has had to rule on this. Did they get every detail right? [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4296.48s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know what it means for the future. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4299.96s)]
*  However, I know the reason they're doing it, which is we've [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4302.48s)]
*  had this unprecedented lawfare against Trump. And that's why [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4305.56s)]
*  they've been forced to do this. So ultimately, I think this is [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4308.92s)]
*  the right decision. No, it does not authorize drone strikes [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4311.32s)]
*  against the president's political enemies. That's insane. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4315.08s)]
*  It does not make the president above the law or a king. And I [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4317.5199999999995s)]
*  think that Roberts in his ruling said that the key things he said [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4320.759999999999s)]
*  that the dissent's position in the end boils down to ignoring [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4325.759999999999s)]
*  the Constitution's separation of powers and the court's precedent, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4329.92s)]
*  and instead fear mongers on the basis of extreme hypotheticals. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4333.48s)]
*  And then he says that the dissents overlook the more likely [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4338.44s)]
*  prospect of an executive branch that cannibalizes itself with [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4341.96s)]
*  each successive president free to prosecute his predecessors, [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4346.12s)]
*  yet unable to boldly and fearlessly carry out his duties [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4350.2s)]
*  for fear that he may be next. I think that's really the key line [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4353.88s)]
*  here is that you're posing all these insane hypotheticals, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4357.4s)]
*  instead of recognizing the practical reality that if you [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4361.84s)]
*  don't give presidents immunity, then the next president is going [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4365.0s)]
*  to prosecute the old president, and future presidents will be [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4368.48s)]
*  hamstrung in doing this very important job that's already [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4371.32s)]
*  difficult enough. So I think that this was just a necessary [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4374.92s)]
*  decision. There was no way around it. And the president [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4378.360000000001s)]
*  already has civil immunity, you got to give him criminal [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4382.320000000001s)]
*  immunity to [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4384.12s)]
*  freeburg your thoughts against the steel man on the other side [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4385.360000000001s)]
*  would be, you know, Trump doing things like calling Georgia and [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4388.4400000000005s)]
*  asking to find votes, or pressuring the president, the [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4392.16s)]
*  vice president to overturn the election results after 60 failed [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4395.4400000000005s)]
*  legal cases, you know, is what's concerning the other side. So do [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4400.44s)]
*  you have a take on it? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4404.839999999999s)]
*  I think that the distinction between acting in their [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4405.599999999999s)]
*  executive capacity as President of the United States versus their [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4411.88s)]
*  personal capacity as an individual candidate, or an [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4415.599999999999s)]
*  individual that could benefit through some other means, is a [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4418.679999999999s)]
*  really good distinction. I think how the courts ultimately [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4423.88s)]
*  adjudicate that distinction is what's still ahead. But I do [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4426.92s)]
*  think that the clarity of that distinction is critical. I it [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4430.72s)]
*  seems like the right thing, how this is going to play out with [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4433.96s)]
*  respect to election interference, does interfering [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4436.76s)]
*  the election constitute one's role as an executive overseeing [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4439.6s)]
*  the federal election process? Or does it constitutes one's [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4444.4400000000005s)]
*  personal benefits that may arise if one is individually elected [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4448.68s)]
*  is the key determinant that the lower court will likely have to [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4451.28s)]
*  make? Maybe that gets kicked back up again in the future. If [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4454.08s)]
*  there's a disagreement over the decision that the court does [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4458.72s)]
*  make with regards to that distinction? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4461.4s)]
*  Where do you stand on that? Saxe, you in previous episodes [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4463.8s)]
*  have said you didn't believe in this election interference and [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4466.12s)]
*  you thought Trump lost? Have you changed your position on that? [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4468.48s)]
*  Or are you still in that position? [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4471.5199999999995s)]
*  That's totally irrelevant to the course decision. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4474.12s)]
*  Let me ask you a follow up to that then. So in the case of do [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4476.04s)]
*  you think Trump was acting officially when he asked Georgia [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4479.32s)]
*  to find the votes when he asked Pence to overturn the election? [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4482.36s)]
*  Or do you think he was acting in his duty? [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4484.759999999999s)]
*  I think that that what you just described there is what's known [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4487.5599999999995s)]
*  as a question of fact in the legal system. There are [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4489.88s)]
*  questions of law and questions of fact. And what the Supreme [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4493.16s)]
*  Court has done is given us a doctrine. They've answered the [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4496.32s)]
*  question of law, they've basically given us a three part [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4499.719999999999s)]
*  test. They said that when the president acts within his [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4501.759999999999s)]
*  exclusive constitutional authority, he gets broad [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4505.12s)]
*  immunity when he does an official duty, but that's not [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4507.639999999999s)]
*  in that category. He gets presumptive immunity, meaning [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4510.56s)]
*  that the prosecutor can still go after him. They just have to [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4513.64s)]
*  rebut the presumption. And when he engages in a personal act, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4515.56s)]
*  there's no immunity. So look, what has to happen now is if [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4519.0s)]
*  Jack Smith wants to continue this prosecution of Trump, he's [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4522.76s)]
*  going to have to make the argument that Trump's acts were [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4526.400000000001s)]
*  either personal or were part of his duties, but he's going to [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4529.4400000000005s)]
*  rebut the presumption. So that is the now the question of fact [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4533.8s)]
*  that Jack Smith would have to litigate. And I'm not going to [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4538.0s)]
*  litigate it here. I don't know the answer to that. But again, I [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4541.16s)]
*  would separate questions of law and questions of fact with the [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4543.88s)]
*  Supreme Court has done I think has given us a useful doctrine [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4546.08s)]
*  that the presidency now needs in light of the reality of [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4549.92s)]
*  warfare. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4553.72s)]
*  So this is the one I think, Chamath, that is super [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4554.44s)]
*  fascinating, because I could see President Trump and his lawyer [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4557.16s)]
*  saying, Hey, very simple, you know, we think there was [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4560.96s)]
*  election interference. So yeah, we called Georgia to make sure [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4564.52s)]
*  that those 11,000 votes were there. And hey, you know, we [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4567.8s)]
*  thought this was not a fair election. So I was acting in my [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4571.4800000000005s)]
*  duty. And when I told Pence to not certify the election, I could [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4573.76s)]
*  see them making that argument. What do you think? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4577.76s)]
*  I don't know the specifics of these cases. But I think it's [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4580.92s)]
*  going to force a prosecutor to have a really strong point of [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4584.56s)]
*  view and have evidence and then go after somebody. But again, I [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4587.96s)]
*  think you're focusing too much on Trump. Robert said in the [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4592.04s)]
*  decision, you have to look past the exigencies of the current [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4595.92s)]
*  moment. This is a set of rules that's about past presidents and [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4600.0s)]
*  future presidents, this is for forever. And so that's the most [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4603.28s)]
*  important thing here, which is there's a set of rules that I [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4608.2s)]
*  think we can all agree on, because the man that we all [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4610.32s)]
*  elect, dutifully elect, is the most powerful person in the [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4613.4400000000005s)]
*  world, we knew it before, we know it now. So even more [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4617.4s)]
*  important that we make sure we're picking one person and [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4622.36s)]
*  that person is capable of doing the job, you may not agree. But [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4625.36s)]
*  they need to be competent and capable of doing the job. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4629.32s)]
*  Yeah. Well, they definitely have to be competent. And this case [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4632.799999999999s)]
*  was brought by Trump over this specific issue. So I think [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4636.12s)]
*  that's what we look at this specific judgment here. That's [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4639.679999999999s)]
*  what they're going to have to determine in the coming months [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4643.0s)]
*  or years with this case is was he acting in his duty? Or was he [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4645.88s)]
*  not? That's going to be a really interesting [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4649.679999999999s)]
*  between this ruling and another case called Fisher versus US, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4652.36s)]
*  which is the January 6 obstruction case where the [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4655.44s)]
*  Supreme Court in a 63 majority found that Sarbanes-Oxley was [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4658.08s)]
*  being misused to create a new crime called obstructing an [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4662.92s)]
*  official proceeding. When you combine that judgment with this [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4667.24s)]
*  judgment, I think Jackson must just resign. It's pretty clear [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4670.28s)]
*  that some court has kicked the legs out from under his case. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4674.12s)]
*  And by the way, Katanji Jackson supported that decision. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4677.04s)]
*  That's right. So again, not a not a not ideological, not a [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4680.48s)]
*  hyperpartisan court. They just ruled that Sarbanes-Oxley had [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4684.759999999999s)]
*  nothing to do with what happened on January 6. And it was being [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4687.799999999999s)]
*  misused by a creative prosecutor. And I told you when [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4690.919999999999s)]
*  these Jack Smith cases first came, I said it's not the job [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4694.16s)]
*  of prosecutor to be creative. Their job is to narrowly [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4697.2s)]
*  interpret the law and to enforce the law. And you combine these [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4700.48s)]
*  rulings together and you can see that Jack Smith has now an even [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4703.919999999999s)]
*  more uphill battle. It's time for him to resign. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4707.04s)]
*  By the way, that's 200 convictions. It's not just one. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4709.96s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4714.72s)]
*  200 of them. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4715.72s)]
*  Small percentage of the overall convictions though. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4716.84s)]
*  They took hundreds of people who did not engage in any violence [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4719.5199999999995s)]
*  on January 6. Many of them just wandered through an open door in [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4723.04s)]
*  the Capitol. And they were prosecuted to the hilt. They [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4727.04s)]
*  were sent to jail for that. Because this DOJ wanted to send [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4729.92s)]
*  them to jail. They wanted to use the statement. They wanted to [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4733.2s)]
*  use them as a political talking point. And that's a shame. I [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4735.2s)]
*  think hundreds of people were horribly mistreated by the [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4739.2s)]
*  judicial system as part of a political prosecution. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4742.72s)]
*  Except for the ones who beat police and brought long guns. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4747.5199999999995s)]
*  No problem putting those people in jail. No problem. Anyone who [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4751.5199999999995s)]
*  used violence, go directly to jail. Do not pass go. But some [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4753.5199999999995s)]
*  of these people just took a tour through the Capitol. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4756.96s)]
*  All those people got suspended sentences and trespassing. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4760.24s)]
*  No, someone went to jail. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4762.639999999999s)]
*  The ones who went to jail. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4764.08s)]
*  Jacob Chansley spent three years in jail. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4765.12s)]
*  Yeah, the ones who went to jail were the ones who beat cops or [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4767.12s)]
*  otherwise brought. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4770.5599999999995s)]
*  No, not Jacob Chansley. That poor man. Just because he wore the [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4771.5599999999995s)]
*  Viking. Remember the guy with the Viking hat? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4774.0s)]
*  Oh yeah. So they also went to jail. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4776.08s)]
*  The Chew and Oz Shaman. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4777.84s)]
*  If you did damage, if you vandalized. Yeah, that was the [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4778.84s)]
*  other reason people went to jail. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4781.36s)]
*  I saw a video of him getting a guided tour through the Capitol. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4782.36s)]
*  I mean, if you vandalized a Capitol building, I guess you [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4785.36s)]
*  have to do something. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4788.08s)]
*  They moved a dais around. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4789.08s)]
*  No, I think they like shattered the windows and you know. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4790.08s)]
*  He did it. I never saw any video of him doing that. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4793.64s)]
*  Anyway, they picked on him because he was an easy target [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4795.84s)]
*  because he looked like a weirdo. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4799.28s)]
*  And he had the Viking horns and he has a history of mental [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4800.28s)]
*  problems. And so they put that man in jail for years. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4805.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not concerned about him. I'm concerned. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4809.08s)]
*  The ones who brought all the long guns to the hotels around [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4811.5599999999995s)]
*  the Capitol to have backup firepower. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4814.08s)]
*  But you know, hey, everybody's got a different opinion on this. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4816.88s)]
*  We, that wraps up the All In Podcast. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4819.88s)]
*  You can have those concerns. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4822.400000000001s)]
*  I don't think it lets you put it on some people in jail. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4824.16s)]
*  Yeah, I think you can hold both of those ideas. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4826.16s)]
*  I don't think anybody in a sense should go to jail. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4828.400000000001s)]
*  I don't think the Oath Keepers should have brought guns to [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4830.08s)]
*  the Capitol. Okay. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4832.2s)]
*  They didn't. They brought them to Virginia, just to be clear. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4833.2s)]
*  Yeah, they brought them to the hotels around them. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4835.400000000001s)]
*  Huge, large caches. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4837.400000000001s)]
*  In Virginia. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4839.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4840.04s)]
*  In Virginia. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4841.04s)]
*  Yeah, they drove to the Capitol on January 6th. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4842.04s)]
*  Anyway, I'm not defending them. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4843.76s)]
*  They brought their guns to the hotel. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4844.76s)]
*  Are you defending them? [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4845.84s)]
*  No, I'm not defending them. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4846.84s)]
*  I'm just clarifying that there are no guns at the Capitol because [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4848.16s)]
*  that's a lie. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4850.52s)]
*  But I don't think innocent people who just wandered through [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4853.2s)]
*  the Capitol should go to jail. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4855.56s)]
*  And that clearly... [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4856.56s)]
*  We agree. We agree that they should not go to jail. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4857.56s)]
*  They should get trespassing tickets. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4859.56s)]
*  Okay. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4860.68s)]
*  This is episode 186 of the World's Number One Podcast. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4861.68s)]
*  Did Biden resign while we were taping? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4866.08s)]
*  Biden just went on a campaign call and he said, let me say [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4868.0s)]
*  this as clearly as I possibly can, as simply and straightforward [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4870.72s)]
*  as I can, I am running. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4873.84s)]
*  No one's pushing me out. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4876.0s)]
*  I'm not leaving. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4877.0s)]
*  I'm in this race to the end and we're going to win. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4878.0s)]
*  Whoa. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4880.64s)]
*  I think it's more likely than not that they're not going to [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4881.64s)]
*  replace Biden because the only feasible alternative is Harris [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4884.04s)]
*  and should be worse. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4888.84s)]
*  And I think it's more dangerous for the country, frankly. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4890.24s)]
*  I'd rather to see Biden finish out his term than put someone [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4892.6s)]
*  new in experience. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4897.32s)]
*  Even if he had to enter our politics. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4898.8s)]
*  Too bad. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4900.8s)]
*  It's too bad choices, J. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4901.84s)]
*  Cal. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4902.96s)]
*  And I don't agree with Biden's policies, but there's continuity [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4903.360000000001s)]
*  there. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOeARghNIaY&t=4906.16s)]
