# In conversation with Sheryl Sandberg, plus open-source AI gene editing explained
**All In Podcast:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY)
*  David Sachs had a last minute board meeting, so he will not be joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=0.0s)]
*  I'll be David Sachs. Please do your best impression. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4.0s)]
*  Can you imagine? Hi, Jason. Hello, sister. How are you? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=6.96s)]
*  Jason, do you know what I'm about to do? I'm so excited. I'm so excited. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  Tell me. Do you remember fake Trimoth? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=15.36s)]
*  Of course. Yes. Do we have a log it? You know who that is, of course, right? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Oh, you're going to reveal who faked Trimoth. I'm revealing. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=21.92s)]
*  Oh, wow. It's a big reveal. Nine years later. I want that handle. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=25.12s)]
*  I would like to get that handle and give it to someone to be. I can do it to you, whoever you [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=29.76s)]
*  want. Well, trust me, there's a lot of people who would love to have the fake Trimoth handle. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=33.92s)]
*  Well, how do I get it? Do I ask the can I ask Linda at Twitter for it? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=37.68s)]
*  Yeah, I you know, we might know somebody at Twitter who can reset the password. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=41.92s)]
*  Maybe you can help me. I'm so credible as the person who deserves that password. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=44.96s)]
*  Of all the people who've suffered spending time with Trimoth, you're at the top of that list. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=49.28s)]
*  Anybody has the right to mock Trimoth. I mean, you've had to watch his growth over [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=54.959999999999994s)]
*  20 years. You've had to suffer. I raised him. I raised Trimoth and he raised me right back. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=62.8s)]
*  All right, welcome back to the program, everybody. One of the guests we've always [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=84.16s)]
*  dreamed about having on the show is considered one of the great business operators of all time [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  in Silicon Valley. For the past 20 years, Sheryl Sandberg was a key. Some might say the key piece [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=92.8s)]
*  in building the two largest advertising and technology companies in the world, Google and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=98.64s)]
*  Facebook. Paradoxically, they don't go by those names anymore. Alphabet and Meta. When she joined [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=103.44s)]
*  Google in 2001, it had 20 million in revenue, they were private. And when she left in 2008, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=109.44s)]
*  they had $22 billion in revenue. When she joined Facebook in 2008, it was at $270 million in revenue. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=115.28s)]
*  When she left, it was at 117 billion. market caps of those two companies have grown 100 billion and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  950 billion during her 10 years. And today both are worth over $3 trillion combined and are the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=128.24s)]
*  number four and number seven market cap companies in the world. However, to our crew, she will always [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=134.56s)]
*  be bestie Dave Goldberg's dream girl, as he once described it to me. He told me he pursued her [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=140.24s)]
*  relentlessly until she finally gave in, dated and then married him and started a beautiful family [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=146.16s)]
*  together. Dave Goldberg passed away nine years ago this week in 2015. In an alternate universe, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=152.08s)]
*  on a different timeline, Goldie would have been one of the four people on this panel, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=159.68s)]
*  because he was the most wise, funny supermensch of the entire 10 person [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  core poker group, the original poker group. In fact, he was twice the man of any of us, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=167.76s)]
*  which given the low benchmark we've set isn't that difficult. We can get at least three shows worth [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=173.92s)]
*  the wisdom from our current guest. But that's not why she's joining us today. She made a documentary, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=180.16s)]
*  and we're here to talk about that. And we'll have some time for business talk at the end, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=185.2s)]
*  which is going to be a very hard pivot, given the nature of the doc. The doc she co-produces [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=188.8s)]
*  called Screams Before Silence. I watched it on the flight back from New York. I had to take three [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  breaks. And it took a lot of tissues, if I'm being honest. It is one of the most difficult hours of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=198.96s)]
*  viewing I've ever had in my life. It is focused on the sexual violence committed by Hamas during [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=205.44s)]
*  and after the October 7 attacks, and which tragically, in all likelihood continues today [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=211.76s)]
*  with the hostages who are still somewhere in Gaza. The documentary also takes on claims in [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=218.56s)]
*  our polluted journalistic conspiracy filled media landscape that claim none of this happens. She [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=224.32s)]
*  traveled to Israel to conduct interviews for it. And outside of comforting the victim, she spends [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=229.76s)]
*  less than 90 seconds speaking in it herself. The stories, of course, speak for themselves. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=234.16s)]
*  Now, this isn't a disclaimer, but some context about this podcast for those of you who are here [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=239.44s)]
*  for the first time might be helpful. We realize we're wading into a conflict that is thousands of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=243.44s)]
*  years old. And it's shrouded in pain and suffering with a foundation on the most deeply held religious [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=248.48s)]
*  beliefs humanity has ever formed. When we do podcasts like this and have guests, we'll be [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=254.39999999999998s)]
*  championed by one side and derided by the other. But as you know, we don't shy away from the hard [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  discussions on this podcast. We go all in on them. Equal time will always be given. And we [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=263.28s)]
*  welcome all sides on these difficult discussions. It goes without saying that we're not here to be [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=268.56s)]
*  your expert or final authority. We're here to have a first principle discussion and to personally [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=273.36s)]
*  learn alongside each other in good faith. In good faith. This is a really important concept, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=277.36s)]
*  because it's hard to have these discussions in good faith today. So with that, I'll welcome [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  to the all in podcasts our bestie, Cheryl Samberg. Well, saying two things you just said that Dave [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=288.0s)]
*  would have been on this podcast. I've thought that actually, and calling me a bestie because [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=294.0s)]
*  I've been friends with all of you for so long means a lot to me. Jason, you dedicated your book to Dave [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=298.56s)]
*  that meant everything to me. David Freeberg and I have been traveling around together to conferences [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=305.04s)]
*  sitting in the backseat of cars. And Shemaz, it's a really special moment to be here with you. We [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=309.36s)]
*  lost Dave nine years ago. Yesterday, we were at our dear friend Phil Joich's 50th birthday party. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=315.28s)]
*  It happened suddenly. I was in shock. Everyone was in shock. Shemaz sprung into action, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=322.32s)]
*  took care of every logistical thing you could have possibly needed. But then he did something, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=328.32s)]
*  you did something, Shemaz, even more important, which is you showed up for my children. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=333.28s)]
*  Not just for the days and weeks, but for the months and years afterwards. And one of the many [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=337.84s)]
*  things you did is you taught them to play poker. Because what you said is if Dave were alive, he [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=341.76s)]
*  would have taught them to play poker. And last night on the ninth anniversary of his loss, my kids [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=346.32s)]
*  were in that room playing poker. And that is very much to your credit, Shemaz. And I will always, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=351.28s)]
*  always be grateful for that and grateful, Jason, to David and all of us for Dave. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=357.36s)]
*  So the world lost something really big when we lost Dave. And I think a lot of people know a [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=365.03999999999996s)]
*  lot of the things we lost. I lost an amazing husband and father to my children. You all lost [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=370.24s)]
*  a best friend. The world lost a lot of wisdom. But there's actually one thing that the world [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=375.6s)]
*  also lost that we've never shared. And I'm prepared to reveal right now, right here, right now. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  Because last night, Rob Goldberg, Dave's brother and I decided, we decided it was time to share. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=388.16s)]
*  People may have known there was a fake Cheimov Twitter handle. I built Facebook, rocked the [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=395.20000000000005s)]
*  angel world, and now on the warriors. My motto, don't be a D bag. That's my job. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=401.12s)]
*  And people have questioned who this was. I mean, some people think it was Jason [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=405.36s)]
*  Calcana. Some people think it was Free Bird. All right. I got to say, some people think it was [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  Cheimov himself, but you know what? The number one choice. Yeah. The number one choice. Yeah. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=414.08s)]
*  Dave was fake Cheimov. Now he didn't write all the tweets himself. I know all of you helped him, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=419.36s)]
*  but he wrote a bunch of them and he used to literally lie in bed next to me, write something [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=424.24s)]
*  and just big bellow. Remember Dave's big laugh. He would laugh out loud. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=429.2s)]
*  And there are so many things the world lost. But can you guys imagine the field day Dave, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=434.64s)]
*  AKA fake Cheimov would be having with this podcast? Field day. Field day. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  All he'd have to do is just take excerpts from the show. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=447.44s)]
*  It's one of the great things about the great challenge. I remember [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=451.91999999999996s)]
*  workshopping some tweets here with Dave, with Goldie and the big laugh we would have and David [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=455.6s)]
*  Lee from the Warriors was involved in this Michigan. I mean, we just had like a whole group [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=462.32s)]
*  who lived to write these tweets. And sometimes Cheimot's tweets were so insane and deranged [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=466.16s)]
*  that we couldn't top them. So basically we tried to come up like this one from fake Cheimov. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=475.12s)]
*  This one from fake Cheimov. This is a great one. Pinterest is a new hot company in the valley. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=480.32s)]
*  I don't understand why a site for girls with patches for 300 million. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=488.32s)]
*  Now that's something that would be a benign tweet from real Cheimov. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=492.88s)]
*  Here's a great one from October 29th, 2011. A lot of demand for me to appear in commercials like [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=497.76s)]
*  others, but I am holding out for Cartier. Mercedes is beneath me. I mean, this predated [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=503.6s)]
*  Laura Piana. Laura Piana. Yeah. Free, but you got this next one. Give us this next one. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=510.48s)]
*  There is a Laura Piana one in there. Yeah. Yeah. Reason number seven 56 to go to Vegas. No sales [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=514.16s)]
*  tax on Laura Piana. This is in 2012, by the way, very precious. If you dress like me, I won't [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=520.3199999999999s)]
*  initially think you are a D back. There's no way Dave know what Laura Piana was. There's no way Dave [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=525.76s)]
*  wrote this. Someone else wrote this one for sure. Absolutely. Who was ahead of the time on Laura [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=531.52s)]
*  Piana at that time? Very good. I mean, it's just incredible. People think the Laura Piana thing is [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=535.28s)]
*  recent history. It was 12 years ago. I mean, this is when... Cheryl, before we get started here. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  Cheryl should read that last one. That's really good. All right, Cheryl, you can pull that one [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=546.7199999999999s)]
*  back. My newest investment is so good. Jet time. You can random video chat with other people who [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=549.8399999999999s)]
*  are also on their private jet. G55 to Hawker. Yeah. Dave loved this group of friends and he [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=556.64s)]
*  loved being fake Cheimov. He loved it. Anyway, the secret's out. The secret's out. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=563.6s)]
*  The secret's out. My guess is that Twitter handle is about to get popular again. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=568.08s)]
*  It's going to get pretty popular. And I will just say, as much as Dave loved being fake Cheimov, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  it's like half the amount Cheimov loves being at Cheimov. So let's just keep that in mind, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=579.12s)]
*  you folks. Oh my God. I haven't cried and laughed so hard in five minutes as I did just now. I mean, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=586.1600000000001s)]
*  actually, in some ways, Cheryl, you're our fifth bestie as well. You're always welcome to come on [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=593.92s)]
*  the pod. And I just also for a little bit of housekeeping here, when guests come on this podcast, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=599.28s)]
*  we don't pre-vet questions, no questions are off limits, and nobody gets to strike or do anything [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=603.92s)]
*  nonsensical with the product. Everybody comes here to have... And we're not journalists. We're [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=608.88s)]
*  not... We're not journalists. We're not traditional journalists. We're friends talking, trying to [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=613.52s)]
*  understand stuff. And just to be clear, I know a lot of commentary comes back, well, why didn't you [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=616.88s)]
*  say this or ask this? And you know, I think we're just when we have guests on, we just want to talk [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=622.08s)]
*  with them like we would in a living room and have a conversation. Right. Which means no gotcha [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=626.1600000000001s)]
*  journalism. Although I'll ask a tough question once in a while that may get me in a little bit [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=630.88s)]
*  of trouble. But David Freyberg, you set this all up. And I know you and Cheryl have been talking [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=636.4000000000001s)]
*  about these important issues. And of course, we're going to have all sides on. So you don't [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=641.84s)]
*  have to email me and say, what about this side? What about that side? All sides are welcome to [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=646.96s)]
*  come on the pod. But Freyberg, why don't you kick us off here? We're going to talk about this [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=651.04s)]
*  important film and a lot of the debates going on about this horrific attack on October 7th, and [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=655.04s)]
*  then what's going on in Gaza today. But then we also are going to try to make that hard pivot to [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=661.68s)]
*  business and get some of Cheryl's insights on what's happening in the world today of business. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=666.64s)]
*  So Freyberg, why don't you kick us off? Well, I just want to zoom out because I think Cheryl, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=670.8s)]
*  we had, I believe it a couple of conversations after October 7th. Amongst other folks, I've heard [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=675.44s)]
*  that there's been a lot of disappointment that institutions, organizations, ideologies that have [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=684.72s)]
*  been supported by folks like yourself, or maybe you can speak, I don't want to put words in your [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=693.04s)]
*  mouth, suddenly emerged to be something quite different when threads of anti-Semitism started [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=697.68s)]
*  to emerge and folks began to deny certain things based on their ideology about the oppressor, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=705.68s)]
*  oppressed concept being applied to Israel and Palestine. And maybe you can tell us a little bit [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=716.4s)]
*  about the surprise and journey that you've been through since October 7th with respect to some of [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=724.56s)]
*  the groups that you've supported that suddenly seemed quite different than what maybe we all [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=730.0s)]
*  thought they were prior. Look, it's a great question because I mean, I'm sorry, and that's [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  the conversation Cheryl and I have been having that led to saying, Hey, why don't you come on [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=740.2399999999999s)]
*  the show this week? And let's talk about this and other topics, particularly given the timing [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=743.76s)]
*  with the release of the film. It's a great question. I mean, if you had told me on October 6th, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=748.56s)]
*  following is going to happen. Terrorists are going to parachute into Israel. They are going to kill [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=755.04s)]
*  1200 people. They are going to sexually brutalize, brutalize and rape multiple women and men. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=761.1999999999999s)]
*  I would have said, you're crazy. Then if you would have told me that people were going to deny the [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=770.16s)]
*  reports were going to start coming out. People were going to say, I'm a first responder. I saw [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=775.76s)]
*  naked bodies. I saw women bloodied, legs spread, but then people were going to deny that this [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=779.52s)]
*  happened. I would have said, you were crazy. And then if you had told me that what we would be [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=786.0s)]
*  doing on college campuses is not protesting sexual violence as a tool of war by the hands of Hamas, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=789.92s)]
*  misogynistic, homophobic terrorists who are right now holding not just Israelis, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=798.96s)]
*  but Americans hostage. Yet we would be protesting and college kids would be screaming, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=804.56s)]
*  we are Hamas. I would have said, you are crazy. And that's hit me hard. And for me as a woman, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=810.16s)]
*  as a very outspoken feminist, it's all hard. But the part that has hit me the hardest is the denial [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=816.16s)]
*  of the sexual violence. That has just been horrible. And so the reports were coming out in November. I [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=821.68s)]
*  wrote an op-ed and what my op-ed said was no matter what you believe should happen in the Middle East, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=828.88s)]
*  I believe in a two-state solution, no matter what flag you're flying, march you're going to, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=833.6s)]
*  you can all be united on one thing, which is sexual violence should never be used as a tool of war. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=838.96s)]
*  Then I did a video that went pretty viral, but people are denying it and they're attacking [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=844.5600000000001s)]
*  articles and attacking reports. And so I went to Israel and I sat down myself with a video crew. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=850.96s)]
*  This was generously financed by this great philanthropist, Joey Lowe and his wife. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=859.28s)]
*  And I sat down there and I asked people, what did you see with your own eyes? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=865.1999999999999s)]
*  We sat down with a released hostage who told her story. And this is because people are actually [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=871.76s)]
*  denying or ignoring this. And that is a horrible place for us to be. And truly shocking, truly [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=878.48s)]
*  shocking. Let's double click into that word denial. So it's a very heightened moment. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=887.84s)]
*  Everybody is taking sides. Everybody's trying to interpret what they think is the right point of [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=894.32s)]
*  view, whether it's in that moment or historically in the arc of how Israel and Palestine have been [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=900.0s)]
*  in conflict. Where does that aspect of denial come from? Have you spent time trying to unpack, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=906.4s)]
*  like how do you start to get to a place where you say clearly people were killed, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=913.36s)]
*  but then when it goes into war crimes and sexual violence, we're actually going to stop it there [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=918.8s)]
*  because it basically pulls our cause back. So we can't agree that that actually happened. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=925.28s)]
*  How does that happen? Why is that happening? I mean, you're framing it exactly right, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=932.0s)]
*  Shamat. That's exactly what happened. So I mean, you all talk about this a lot, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=935.8399999999999s)]
*  but there's huge polarization. What does that mean? Polarization means I have a view that is [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=939.52s)]
*  so firmly entrenched that I see the word as black and white. Everything has to fit into my view and [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=944.0799999999999s)]
*  my narrative. And when it doesn't fit, I don't know what to do. So I reject it. And that's, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=948.8s)]
*  I think what's happening, that there are people out there who believe that October 7th was [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=953.4399999999999s)]
*  resistance. I want to be clear. I'm not that person. I do not believe that. I'm horrified [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=958.16s)]
*  by what's happening in Gaza. Every life lost is too much. I want two states living peacefully [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=963.28s)]
*  beside each other. I really want that. But let's say you think October 7th was resistance. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=968.96s)]
*  Then all of a sudden you're like, wait a second, mass rape, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=976.32s)]
*  genital mutilation of men and women, women and men, women tied to trees, naked, bloodied, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=982.8000000000001s)]
*  leg spread. That doesn't fit your narrative. So what can you do? You can think, maybe the world [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=990.24s)]
*  isn't so black and white. Maybe I have to rethink my narrative. Or you can say this didn't happen. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=994.8s)]
*  And I think it is a travesty and a tragedy that anyone could say that. And I want to be clear, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1001.12s)]
*  Jason, you started this by saying you always have positions. You always give people room for two [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1006.9599999999999s)]
*  sides. And that's fantastic. I think there are not just two sides, multiple sides to the Middle East [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1012.24s)]
*  story, multiple sides to the history, multiple sides of what's been going on. There are not two [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1017.4399999999999s)]
*  sides on this. This is sexual violence. There is one side, one side, and we are against it. And [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1022.32s)]
*  that's relatively new in the world. To take you back quick history lesson, which you all know, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1028.8s)]
*  but I'd love for all your viewers to know. For a long time, the history of mankind, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1032.8s)]
*  women's bodies were part of war. You got the village, you got the gold, you got the women. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1038.24s)]
*  And it was only 30 years ago after the mass rapes of the DRC, Bosnia, the former Yugoslavia, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1043.2s)]
*  that people said, no, rape is not a tool of war. We will prosecute it as a war crime and a crime [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1049.04s)]
*  against humanity. And the feminist groups were the ones who made that happen. The civil rights [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1056.08s)]
*  groups, the human rights groups, they've held since then in this moment. If our politics drive [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1060.48s)]
*  us to give that up, think about what we give up. Because as we're doing this podcast right now, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1066.16s)]
*  there are hostages in Gaza that we know are being sexually assaulted. There are women in Ukraine, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1071.3600000000001s)]
*  Sudan, Ethiopia, around the world who are being sexually assaulted right now, right now. And we [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1078.08s)]
*  can't let that go. This is the one place we need to be united. Why are the feminist groups [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1085.36s)]
*  finding themselves aligning more with Hamas than they are with this core, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1092.24s)]
*  what seems to be and should be a core ideology? So look, we can't paint them all with one brush. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1098.3999999999999s)]
*  There are feminist groups that have spoken out on this, that have said, you know, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1104.16s)]
*  now did it, the new NARAL did it. They said, we are against the sexual violence. CARE did it. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1110.3200000000002s)]
*  There are groups that have done it, no matter what else they're working on. A bunch of them have said [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1115.6000000000001s)]
*  to me privately, I know you're right. Of course, sexual violence isn't okay. And of course, this [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1119.92s)]
*  happened. But I can't speak out because all my employees are going to get upset. I can't speak [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1124.88s)]
*  out because the young people. And that makes me really sad. But explain that. What does that mean? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1129.1200000000001s)]
*  People will be upset to know that both things happen. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1134.4s)]
*  You've got to be able to hold two thoughts at the same time. Again, not my thought, but if you believe [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1139.76s)]
*  October 7th is resistant, you can still believe sexual violence happened. The fact that a group [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1144.96s)]
*  of feminists, none I'm particularly close to have actually signed letters saying, this didn't happen, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1150.16s)]
*  is crazy. Absolutely crazy. I mean, look, I'm going to read this. The UN Special Representative [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1157.68s)]
*  on Sexual Violence, Pramila Patten traveled to Israel. And here is what she wrote. She said, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1163.52s)]
*  I witnessed in Israel where scenes of unspeakable violence perpetrated with shocking brutality, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1168.6399999999999s)]
*  catalog of the most extreme and inhumane forms of killing, torture and other horrors, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1173.84s)]
*  including sexual violence. That's the UN. They're not exactly a pro-Israel group. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1178.24s)]
*  Cheryl, let me ask, because I think it's important to note some people will counter and say, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1185.04s)]
*  look at this article from Grayzone. Grayzone said, Western media concocts evidence that the [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1189.52s)]
*  UN report on October 7th sex crimes failed to deliver for March 7th. They said, Western media [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1195.04s)]
*  promoted a UN report as proof Hamas sexually assaulted Israelis. Yet the report's authors [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1200.8s)]
*  admitted they couldn't locate a single victim, suggested Israeli officials staged a rape scene [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1205.6s)]
*  and denounced inaccurate forensic interpretations. I just want to give you an opportunity to respond [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1210.08s)]
*  to Grayzone's article because I think a lot of folks have pointed to that article and the [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1214.24s)]
*  articles that that organization has put out as being representative of an alternative view [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1219.76s)]
*  that the sexual violence maybe didn't happen as evidenced in your film. Maybe you can address it, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1225.76s)]
*  give you a chance to do that. Yeah. Well, the key thing you said there is [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1230.56s)]
*  where are the, they're asking where are the victims? Well, let me tell you where the victims are. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1234.0s)]
*  They're dead. They're dead. That is why we call this film, sorry, screams before silence. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1238.16s)]
*  I have a story in this film, this woman, Tali, I went with her to the trailer where she hid. She [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1246.16s)]
*  was at the Nova Film Festival. She's a nurse. She hid in a trailer. I walked in with her to that [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1252.0s)]
*  trailer the first time she'd been in there and you could see her body like shake and she, we didn't, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1257.1200000000001s)]
*  this didn't make the final cut of the film, but she picked up a black sweater and I think she might [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1261.76s)]
*  have been wearing that sweater. I was afraid to ask her, but she was like shaking. She hid in that [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1265.68s)]
*  trailer for, I don't know, five, six, seven hours and she heard, sometimes she would hear like a [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1270.4s)]
*  little scream like, ah, someone's pointing a gun at you and a shot, but sometimes she would [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1275.04s)]
*  heard scream over and over and over, stop, stop. And then for like long period, like 15 minutes, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1279.28s)]
*  and then a shot. And then when she got out of that trailer, there were naked bodies where she heard [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1287.92s)]
*  those screams. The victims are dead. Most of them are dead. There is exactly one person who is an [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1294.32s)]
*  escaped, released hostage. Her name is Amit Sasana. She gave a video interview. You all saw it. We [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1302.24s)]
*  have the only video interview in this documentary and she tells her story very clearly. She was held [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1307.28s)]
*  hostage for months. She was chained to a bed and as she said it, her captor forced him to do a, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1313.2s)]
*  commit a sexual act on her. This woman is so brave and she told me she's speaking out [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1320.24s)]
*  because there are still hostages there, but she is the only living witness to speak out. We think [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1327.1200000000001s)]
*  there are a few more who are in deep trauma, but there were 1200 people killed and at least dozens [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1331.76s)]
*  of them were sexually brutalized, assaulted. And that is why they're not speaking out. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1339.3600000000001s)]
*  Just as a follow-up, what is the social and political motivation of a group like Grayzone [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1344.96s)]
*  and other appointed deniers? What are they trying to accomplish by denying? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1349.44s)]
*  They're trying to accomplish their narrative that October 7th was justified resistance [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1354.3200000000002s)]
*  because even they understand that it is not- Because the sexual violence taints it in a way, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1360.24s)]
*  right? As opposed to just being soldiers killing soldiers, the sexual violence aspect of it [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1366.72s)]
*  ain't the valor of the resistance. Is that a fair way to summarize it? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1371.6000000000001s)]
*  Yes. Even they don't believe, and it's interesting, Hamas has been proudly talking [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1375.84s)]
*  about who they killed, but even they deny the sexual violence, that wouldn't happen. It's [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1382.56s)]
*  against our religion. The sexual violence doesn't fit the narrative, but I want to be clear. The [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1385.9199999999998s)]
*  sexual violence was multiple locations, systematic, meets the definition of a war crime, a crime [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1392.1599999999999s)]
*  against humanity and was part of the plan. If there was no sexual violence, would it be fair [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1399.28s)]
*  to call it a resistance? I would not call it a resistance. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1404.56s)]
*  One of the things that happened after the Holocaust was there was still a small cohort [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1409.28s)]
*  of people that denied that it ever happened. I think that there was, to use the word systematic [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1415.12s)]
*  again, a systematic effort to document, right? There's pictures, there's museums, there's [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1420.96s)]
*  memorials. You can think what you want of World War II or Jews in general, but you can't deny [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1428.88s)]
*  that that happened. And the documentation of it is pretty unambiguous or completely unambiguous. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1435.44s)]
*  When you spend time there, is there an effort to start doing this? And here's where I'm getting [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1443.44s)]
*  to, which is kind of a morbid question, but there was a moment in this documentary where this woman [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1447.5200000000002s)]
*  who was the doctor in the morgue, I guess, is talking about all of these bodies. And unfortunately, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1453.44s)]
*  where my mind went to, but I think it's kind of the right thought is I hope that there was [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1459.28s)]
*  rape kits done, even if it's posthumously, because that's the trail of evidence that allows one to [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1466.56s)]
*  know squarely inside of a box, this is the totality of what happened as a learning lesson for [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1474.0s)]
*  everybody, including not just the people that disagree, but the people that agree. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1481.28s)]
*  And then to reinforce some of these basic rights that we thought we've all signed up for. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1485.84s)]
*  I mean, it is such an important question. There were not rape kits done. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1490.32s)]
*  1200 people killed in one day. I don't, anyone was people, their bodies were burned, people were [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1495.04s)]
*  trying to identify them. I've actually looked into this a bunch. And in a lot of sexual violence in [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1499.52s)]
*  war situations, there are no rape kits. So that's actually sometimes they're used, but often in chaos, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1504.3999999999999s)]
*  there is none. There are very few pictures. There are some, and I saw them in this documentary, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1509.44s)]
*  and they are, sorry, they are naked women with nails in their groin. Like, I'm sorry, I saw these [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1515.44s)]
*  pictures, but what's interesting about it is the people who are the first responders are taught [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1526.8s)]
*  not to take pictures, particularly of gruesome things. They don't have the victims, the victims, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1531.92s)]
*  you know, victims rights. But the man I interviewed, he said 24 hours in, he thought to [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1538.88s)]
*  himself, no one's going to believe this, I got to take pictures. And against the training he had, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1545.8400000000001s)]
*  he took the pictures and he showed me on his phone. He was like, I took this. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1550.24s)]
*  And another guy from Zocca, they're a first responder group that goes in. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1554.16s)]
*  This is an unheard of situation. I mean, I said to him, you've been processing, sorry, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1558.96s)]
*  maybe that's not the right word. You've been, I guess, processing dead bodies all over the world. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1564.48s)]
*  How many times in your experience are they naked? And he just looked at me and said, never, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1569.68s)]
*  they're never naked. And what meets the legal criteria for proving crimes against humanity [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1574.48s)]
*  are witnesses, eyewitnesses, and what's important about the documentary that we did, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1582.0800000000002s)]
*  but also important about the efforts Israel is doing. Israel is doing that documentation, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1587.3600000000001s)]
*  not Israel, the country, a woman in Israel named Kochav Levy, who's fantastic. She is from a private [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1592.0s)]
*  university with private funding doing that documentation, which at this point are mostly [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1598.64s)]
*  considered of interviews, but there are hundreds of them. And look, I hope people watch in the [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1604.0s)]
*  documentary, I go into a field with this guy, Rami. I'm sure you guys remember this. He, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1610.8000000000002s)]
*  because he's huge, right? He, he stands like this tall over me, private citizen. This guy is the [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1615.6000000000001s)]
*  biggest hero I've ever met in my life. Sirens go off. He gets into his car, takes his gun [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1622.16s)]
*  and drives to where- Incredible bravery. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1627.8400000000001s)]
*  Rescued hundreds of people himself, himself. But he got to a field and I stood in those trees. And [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1631.8400000000001s)]
*  he said, these trees, he thinks about 30 women were there and raped or sexually brutalized. When [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1640.16s)]
*  he saw them, they were naked, tied to trees, legs red bloodied, like bloodied in the regions, you [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1645.04s)]
*  would be bloody if you were raped. And he, what he said in the film is I got there, I covered their [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1652.0s)]
*  bodies so no one else would see. He didn't take pictures. I wish he had, but well, I guess, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1657.52s)]
*  I don't know. Do I wish he had? I don't know. But you understand why. But he said, I saw this with [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1663.68s)]
*  my own eyes. And what you saw in the film is this huge man who's so brave, fought terrorists, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1669.44s)]
*  himself crying because he didn't get there early enough to save those women. But the good news is [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1675.04s)]
*  while the victims were killed, the good news is the first responders are alive and their testimony, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1679.92s)]
*  which is eyewitness testimony, meets the criteria of any international or global court. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1686.24s)]
*  Absolutely, crimes can be proven by eyewitnesses for sure. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1692.48s)]
*  Cheryl, what is the response? What is the response in Israel? How do you judge what Netanyahu is doing [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1697.92s)]
*  both in reaction to the events, but then in reaction to these specific aspects of the events? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1706.0800000000002s)]
*  What are they doing that's different or what would you wish they were doing differently? Or [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1713.1200000000001s)]
*  can you just give us a sense of how people are processing this aspect? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1718.56s)]
*  I mean, look, we need peace. We need two sides and two leaders that are committed to peace, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1724.48s)]
*  like long-term peace. And there's a lot going wrong. But on this aspect, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1732.8s)]
*  someone said it in the film, you violate a woman, you violate a country. There's a reason sexual [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1739.9199999999998s)]
*  violence is used as a war crime. There's a reason it was used in the DRC and Bosnia and it's being [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1745.1999999999998s)]
*  used in Ukraine today because, and I can see it in your reaction. I mean, I watch y'all- [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1750.56s)]
*  It's to humiliate a people. It's to humiliate a country. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1755.36s)]
*  You humiliate, look at the three of you. You all don't cry a lot. This is traumatic because you [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1758.72s)]
*  all have mothers and daughters. You can feel what happens to a country and that's why this was done. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1765.92s)]
*  This was not an accident. This was on purpose. And unfortunately, it works. Sexual violence- [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1773.8400000000001s)]
*  I think for us to have a path towards peace, there has to be a degree, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1782.72s)]
*  despite the pain being felt, a degree of empathy for the other side's desires, the other side's [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1789.8400000000001s)]
*  pain, the other side's feeling that they were enacting a resistance against an oppression. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1798.24s)]
*  How does one side embrace that aspect having gone through this? How do we get to a point [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1805.2s)]
*  that a people can say, I have empathy for the resistance after feeling this sort of pain? And [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1811.92s)]
*  this is the age old story of war, eye for an eye, it never ends. It always goes on. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1819.04s)]
*  What's the right path here to hear the other side, to hear the kids on campuses, to hear the people [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1825.3600000000001s)]
*  in Palestine, to hear the world saying, we feel free Palestine after going through this? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1832.0s)]
*  Well, I can tell you what I believe. I believe we need peace. I believe we need two states. I [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1841.2s)]
*  believe that those states need to be run by peaceful leaders who want prosperity for the other side. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1845.52s)]
*  Look, I believe we should be able to look at anyone anywhere in the world, but certainly [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1851.68s)]
*  the Palestinian people living in Gaza and say any death is too much. One death is too much. No [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1856.3200000000002s)]
*  innocent lives should be killed. No women, no children, no innocent lives should be killed. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1863.0400000000002s)]
*  But I think also as part of that path to peace, there needs to be forgiveness, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1868.24s)]
*  but there needs to be a clear, clear articulation of what is not acceptable ever. And the sexual [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1872.6399999999999s)]
*  violence is not acceptable ever. If you were Netanyahu, what would you do differently? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1881.44s)]
*  I'm sorry for cutting you off. No, no. I mean, I don't have an answer to peace in the Middle [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1887.6s)]
*  East. I don't. I mean, I wish I did, but I do have a very strong view that we are not going to get to [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1892.56s)]
*  peace when we are apologizing or denying crimes against humanity and crime, mass rape of women. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1899.04s)]
*  But that is not the path to peace. The path to peace is not saying this didn't happen. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1904.88s)]
*  The path to peace is saying this happened no matter what side of the fence you're on, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1910.08s)]
*  no matter what side of the world you're on. If you're the far right, the far left, anywhere [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1913.92s)]
*  in the world, we're not going to let this happen again. And we're going to get to peace to make sure [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1917.52s)]
*  denial is not going to get us there. Why is the other side captivated so much of the youth in [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1922.08s)]
*  the United States? You're very close to Harvard. Maybe tell us what's gone on at Harvard over the [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1927.04s)]
*  last few years. How did we end up in this place where so much of the youth is so sympathetic [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1931.52s)]
*  to the Palestinian cause and not as moved as you are by the trauma experienced on the other side? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1937.12s)]
*  I mean, y'all are, I would throw that question right back to you. I know you've talked about, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1945.52s)]
*  you know, narratives and oppressor and oppressed. And again, polarization is where you can only have [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1949.84s)]
*  one view and you cannot tolerate anything that doesn't fit one view. And I don't know of anything [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1956.72s)]
*  that's that clear and that simple. I mean, I'll throw that right back to you. You all have been [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1962.24s)]
*  articulate on this and I think have a lot to say. Well, I mean, this, you said it earlier, Cheryl, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1966.8s)]
*  this tolerance for ambiguity, this ability, the cognitive dissonance to be able to hold in your [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1971.6s)]
*  head that the people of Gaza are suffering. Perhaps I guess the other side would say, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1977.36s)]
*  you know, they would, they would start down this what about ism. It's not my position, but [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1982.56s)]
*  what about what Netanyahu is doing? What about aid to people suffering Gaza? You've addressed that. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1986.32s)]
*  You don't believe anybody should suffer, but I just want to talk a little bit about [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1991.52s)]
*  this conspiracy theory that it didn't happen. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1996.8799999999999s)]
*  Also in the documentary, the savagery, you chose not to show the graphic photos that you saw and [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=1998.8000000000002s)]
*  that you're clearly traumatized by. And a lot of us New Yorkers had a similar experience with 9-11 [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2010.0s)]
*  and watching that up close. It is what terrorists do. Terrorists do these things to cause massive [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2016.0s)]
*  trauma, to make it impossible to deescalate. That is the sadism. That is the, that is the [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2020.5600000000002s)]
*  sadism. That is the pure evil of this brand of terrorism is to make it impossible for the [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2026.96s)]
*  good people of the world to unwind or deescalate. And it's, I think part of the process is accepting [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2033.92s)]
*  what happened and coming to some truth. And the truth can be there are people dying unnecessarily [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2042.0s)]
*  in Gaza. There are people starving in Gaza. There are children who are not getting food and water. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2048.2400000000002s)]
*  All of those can be true. And this horrific sexual sadism and violence that occurred is also true. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2053.12s)]
*  That was awesome. I couldn't have said that better. That was exactly right, Jason. That is [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2062.72s)]
*  exactly the point and the path. Sorry, please continue. I'm trying to make sense of this. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2068.0s)]
*  And I come to it with humility. This podcast hits certain notes with people and, oh, how can [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2074.48s)]
*  people in Silicon Valley or whatever discuss these topics? Listen, we're all discussing, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2081.52s)]
*  we're all trying to make sense of a very confusing world, but you made two choices in the documentary. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2085.44s)]
*  One was to leave yourself out of it. Largely your role in the documentary is, you know, to hug people [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2091.12s)]
*  and to cry alongside them and to witness the stuff. We talked for, I think, 90 seconds in the whole [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2096.88s)]
*  documentary. I think this was a important decision you made. I mean, then you made a decision, which [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2101.44s)]
*  I'm not sure if I agree with, which is to not show the photos. I am of the belief that people [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2106.4s)]
*  should see what happened on 9-11 as a New Yorker who witnessed it and my brothers in the power [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2113.12s)]
*  department. And I had PTSD from it. I think people have to see these things. You chose not to out of [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2117.12s)]
*  respect for the family should put a note at the end. Explain this choice because I know you must [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2121.92s)]
*  have struggled with it. And there are photos that you've seen of women with their breasts covered. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2127.92s)]
*  I don't want to say these things. I know it's very traumatic, but I believe people have to understand [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2134.0s)]
*  what's in these photos that you saw nails in women's private parts, breasts that have been [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2138.32s)]
*  cut off. This is undeniable. If you want to deny the rapes happened or whatever, you cannot deny [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2144.32s)]
*  the photos that you saw. He chose not to put them in. I understand that decision. Respect for the [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2148.8s)]
*  family. Is there not a take us into that decision? Because maybe there's a maybe you need to. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2154.4s)]
*  And the and the and the woman who chose to do the interview with you, she's so brave. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2161.12s)]
*  She said, I had to do this because I wanted to combat the denialism. And I don't know who [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2166.32s)]
*  the gray zone is that you know, the the and I don't know why people are giving it a ton of [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2170.64s)]
*  attention, but they you know, they are considered the first line of Wikipedia pages is a fringe [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2174.4s)]
*  website. So just leave it at that. I don't know if it is or it isn't. But that's the first one. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2178.48s)]
*  Is there not a case to be made for making a second version of the documentary that shows [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2183.68s)]
*  exactly these things so people can stop denying it because then they you would have to come to [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2190.56s)]
*  the place that these that the people who are one sided created fake images. Is that is that is that [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2194.56s)]
*  we're we're getting to in this conspiracy field filled world that the dozens of people you [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2203.2000000000003s)]
*  interviewed are part of a grand conspiracy and the photos are doctored. So just talk about that [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2209.36s)]
*  decision. You must have had an important meeting about that. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2214.88s)]
*  Look, we didn't really have a choice. I agree with you. I think the world seeing this [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2219.76s)]
*  would probably be necessary at some point. I do think the deniers will deny they'll say, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2226.56s)]
*  Oh, you can doctor any photo. So you're gonna have to believe the person who took them anyway, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2231.04s)]
*  we didn't have that choice. These photos are held by people who have taken a vow as part of their [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2236.8s)]
*  work as first responders of processing and getting bodies ready for burial that they won't show them. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2243.92s)]
*  It also you know, we've made this freely available on YouTube. So anyone can watch it. No firewalls, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2250.88s)]
*  you know, anyone can watch this thing. If you're over 18, they wouldn't meet YouTube standards. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2256.16s)]
*  So that would be taken down. I mean, we can't show them right now for those two reasons. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2261.92s)]
*  But I think over time, we the world may have to see some of them. But I also want to go back to [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2266.48s)]
*  what Shammat said, because there are not that there are photos, there are clear photos, and there [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2271.2s)]
*  are clear witnesses. But Rami story, he took no photos, and he will tell you why he took no photos. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2275.2s)]
*  He covered those bodies, so no one would see. So it's traumatic. And, and, and that's why Israel [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2281.8399999999997s)]
*  is documenting this or not Israel, actually, I shouldn't say it's someone in Israel is documenting [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2289.04s)]
*  this. But again, no matter what else you believe, I love the way you said it, Jason, you can [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2293.8399999999997s)]
*  absolutely believe I absolutely believe that every single person, particularly the private [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2299.52s)]
*  citizens, not the terrorists in Gaza should live in peace and harmony. They should, of course, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2305.7599999999998s)]
*  get aid, but they shouldn't need aid because they should have a thriving economy and a state that's [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2311.2s)]
*  their own. That doesn't mean sexual violence didn't happen because it is clear it did. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2316.32s)]
*  And the denial is crazy. I was in France, I did, I took some of the witnesses to different [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2322.48s)]
*  parliaments, including in the French Parliament. And Maurice Levy hosted this beautiful lunch for [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2328.16s)]
*  us. And there were all the people who work in civil society. And this woman stood up at this [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2334.72s)]
*  lunch, and she stood up and she said, I'm French. I'm not Jewish. I run a nonprofit that works on [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2339.12s)]
*  sexual violence and conflict. I've done this work for 30 years. No one's ever questioned my work ever [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2346.0s)]
*  until now. And she said, I think it's anti-Semitism. You look at that New York Times article, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2354.16s)]
*  and I know there's different views of the New York Times. I'm not defending the paper, but that [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2360.4s)]
*  article written by Jeff Gettelman and others, he has covered sexual violence for decades. He won [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2364.08s)]
*  a Pulitzer for his coverage of this in Somalia. A Pulitzer. I did a search. No one's ever questioned [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2370.8s)]
*  it before. Something is going on here. And it is a combination of narratives and polarization [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2377.76s)]
*  and anti-Semitism, which is getting us to a place where we lose. Yeah, sorry. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2383.6000000000004s)]
*  Let's explore that for a second. So when you see the videos, what you see [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2389.28s)]
*  are young people, but you see a lot of young women. And many of the leaders of these [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2394.6400000000003s)]
*  movements on campuses now, the spokespeople are women. The leadership seems mostly to be women. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2401.12s)]
*  Do you have a reaction to that? Do you have a thought on that when you see these folks and that [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2410.4s)]
*  they should be closer to this realization maybe than a man could theoretically overlook it or [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2415.84s)]
*  try to block it out? But it's actually the leadership of these organizations tend to be [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2423.6s)]
*  mostly women led. And they're basically like, let's keep going. And it's about this resistance. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2428.08s)]
*  How do you react to that? When you see that? It really depends what I see. Like when I see [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2432.24s)]
*  someone peacefully protesting and saying free Palestine. Sure. Why not? That's, that's good. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2437.2s)]
*  I want free Palestine. When I see people protesting and saying, you know, we need [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2443.6s)]
*  peace on all sides, we need a ceasefire. Of course we need we need a permanent ceasefire [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2449.04s)]
*  a permanent ceasefire. That last I'm for that. Ready? When I see people saying the rapes didn't [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2453.7599999999998s)]
*  happen, that's unacceptable. You know, you saw a student at Columbia, I saw it on video. I'm sure [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2459.68s)]
*  you did too. Screaming at a Jewish kid, go back to Poland. Right. Or October 7th is going to happen [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2464.7999999999997s)]
*  to you over and over. That's not okay. And so it really depends what they're saying. But again, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2472.48s)]
*  I'm hoping people watch this documentary so they can see it for their own eyes. I'm hoping people [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2478.08s)]
*  wake up and realize that they are capable of holding two thoughts at the same time. They just [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2482.8s)]
*  are. What's going to happen at Harvard? What's going to happen at the Ivy leagues? I don't know [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2487.6800000000003s)]
*  what's going to happen at any of these schools. But I'll tell you, I'm a parent of college age kids. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2492.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, I've got a kid who was in college for a year. I've got a kid going off this year in the [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2498.96s)]
*  fall. Colleges have a responsibility to keep our kids safe, full stop and protect them from hate, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2502.96s)]
*  full stop. And they have the ability to do this. They have the ability to do this. It's up to them. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2510.4s)]
*  Do you think Columbia has done a good job? Well, if you were president of Harvard, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2517.36s)]
*  what would you have done differently? So I'm not close enough. It's all merging together in my [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2520.48s)]
*  mind. I don't know exactly which protest has happened at which schools. But here's, here's [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2525.04s)]
*  what I would do. Yeah, I would have very clear rules, which by the way, all the schools have, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2528.64s)]
*  it's a question of enforcing them. Right. The schools that are letting this happen are not [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2533.76s)]
*  enforcing their own rules. Schools are actually, I think, look, free and open dialogue is important. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2537.6s)]
*  College is the place you should go to talk about the issues from all sides, to have thoughtful [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2542.7999999999997s)]
*  conversations, to have deep conversations, even maybe to have angry conversations. Yeah. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2548.96s)]
*  But not violent. I went to Berkeley. I went to Berkeley. It wasn't lunch without a protest. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2554.08s)]
*  I mean, that's like the daily thing you do there. You know, you go grab a sandwich and you go protest [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2558.08s)]
*  and go back to class. Like that was great. And I bet you had thoughtful conversations because [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2561.92s)]
*  that's what's made you you look out. Look how complex look at your views, David, you're able [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2566.72s)]
*  to articulate multiply complex views. And I bet some of that was from Berkeley, where you probably [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2570.7999999999997s)]
*  sat with your fellow students and talk to them. Right. That's not what's happening. I think things [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2575.2799999999997s)]
*  are very different. Yeah, I think things are very different. These colleges have rules. Some of the [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2581.68s)]
*  colleges there, most colleges have a rule that you can't protest in the president's office. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2586.8799999999997s)]
*  There are colleges where the faculty and administration when people are protesting in [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2591.12s)]
*  the president's office, they're serving them food. There are colleges that say you're not allowed [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2595.44s)]
*  to protest here. Go outside. But if you feel if you feel deep down in your heart that it's a matter [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2599.76s)]
*  of life or death, don't you feel justified that having an encampment setting up a tent living [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2604.7200000000003s)]
*  there showing that that degree of conviction is necessary because you're saving lives versus, hey, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2609.84s)]
*  I think something is a good idea. Let me go protest for an hour during lunch and then I'll leave. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2616.32s)]
*  It's never going to move the needle. The question I'm asking as a young person is how do I move the [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2620.16s)]
*  needle? And there's not a lot of ways that people feel empowered to move the needle. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2624.32s)]
*  So it seems rational to me to some degree that they want to go into these encampments and they [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2628.2400000000002s)]
*  want to do something strong and show their conviction. But again, I think that there's a [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2633.36s)]
*  question on how much truth or is anyone willing to see how much are folks willing to embrace the [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2638.8s)]
*  other side? How much are they willing to listen? I see very little listening, very little dialogue [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2643.44s)]
*  going on because then you put up a list of demands that are unneedable and you know, you deny any one [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2647.6800000000003s)]
*  to have a conversation and you deny listening to the other side and you take this hardened view [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2654.3999999999996s)]
*  that doesn't allow for progress. And I think it's the hardened views on all sides that's limiting [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2658.96s)]
*  progress entirely. Unfortunately, the youth have been subsumed by this and it's really frustrating [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2664.0s)]
*  to see because I worry about what that leads to. I think it's not necessarily the youth, meaning [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2669.7599999999998s)]
*  I think you're seeing it in some very specific places that cater to a very specific kind of [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2675.8399999999997s)]
*  youth. You see them at Columbia, Harvard, there are these specific Berkeley, UCLA that are bastions [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2680.96s)]
*  of privileged kids for the most part. These are extremely elite institutions that typically [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2687.52s)]
*  allow in kids that have been coached their entire lives to get into those schools. And I think that [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2694.4s)]
*  they're coming there with a lack of fulfillment. And it reminds me at some level of how people [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2699.92s)]
*  reacted to Occupy Wall Street, meaning there were a whole bunch of young people there that [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2709.04s)]
*  probably didn't even know what the whole Occupy Wall Street movement was about. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2714.8s)]
*  Yeah. Well, they set themselves up. It was a platform for whatever your grievance was. That [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2718.32s)]
*  was their stated mission. Yeah. And I think what they found a decade and a half ago or so was [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2723.04s)]
*  community in this weird way, right? The physical interaction of other people where you had this [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2728.72s)]
*  intimacy around a thing. I'm not condoning Occupy Wall Street just like I'm not condoning what's [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2733.6s)]
*  happening on campuses. But I think psychologically, what kids are looking for is that level of [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2737.6s)]
*  attachment. And to your point, David, something that they can feel strongly about. And I think [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2742.48s)]
*  they end up getting to the age of 18 and 19, not having felt strongly about anything, because they [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2748.48s)]
*  were working on playing nine sports and 14 instruments and all this other bullsh** to go [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2753.2s)]
*  to these schools. And then they get there and they feel a little empty. And sometimes negative [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2757.92s)]
*  things can fill the void. What I was going to say is I think the answer lies in what you're [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2763.6s)]
*  saying. David, you started out by saying, how are we going to get to progress? Well, screaming at [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2767.92s)]
*  each other is not going to get to progress. I don't have an answer for peace in the Middle East, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2772.48s)]
*  but universities play roles in getting there. Thoughtful, hard conversations. Let's look at [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2776.4s)]
*  the real history. Let's look at who the leadership could be. Let's look at what kind of leaders we [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2783.04s)]
*  need on both sides. Let's look at what the international community could be doing. Those [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2788.24s)]
*  answers could come out of universities. Some of those college students, if they weren't reading [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2793.12s)]
*  five things they don't understand, could help us get there. And I think these protests are getting [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2797.8399999999997s)]
*  in the way of the thoughtful dialogue. And I honestly think part of what happens with cancel [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2802.64s)]
*  culture, I don't want to listen to another view on all sides. Really, why don't you say, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2809.2s)]
*  I want to listen. My friend Adam Grant wrote a great book called Think Again. I wish everyone in [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2816.3199999999997s)]
*  the whole world would read that damn book. Think Again. Think Again means you might not be right [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2821.6s)]
*  about everything. Think Again means you need to listen to the other side. We're never going to [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2826.16s)]
*  get there without that kind of thoughtful dialogue. Well, yeah, that's exactly where I wanted to go [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2832.48s)]
*  with it, Cheryl, which is if you steal a man, if you look at their perspective and you look at [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2836.72s)]
*  the beauty of feminism and femininity, and you wrote a book, Lean In, and you are an expert on this, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2842.4s)]
*  and having compassion for people who are suffering is absolutely beautiful. It is the best of [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2850.08s)]
*  humanity. And I think it's the best of femininity and women is that they have this incredible gift [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2856.64s)]
*  of empathy that as men, maybe we are so far behind. And so it does not surprise me that women lead [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2862.88s)]
*  these organizations when they see suffering. And if you see children suffering, women are in a unique [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2869.04s)]
*  position in their life experience to understand the value of children, of family, and of suffering, [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2874.08s)]
*  and, you know, I can understand an impressionable young person seeing the videos coming out of Gaza [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2880.0s)]
*  of a baby dying in a bombing and collateral damage and being devastated and saying, you know what, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2886.64s)]
*  I have to fight for these poor children. It is completely noble in their mind. In fact, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2891.12s)]
*  it might be noble. I mean, it's in to fight for peace. And so, you know, I can understand their [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2897.52s)]
*  positions, and I don't actually disagree with them. But then you start looking at the reality [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2905.36s)]
*  of getting the hostages back. And if this was an American situation, and we actually have a [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2911.84s)]
*  corollary 9-11, we didn't go to Afghanistan to get hostages, we went there to get retribution. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2918.64s)]
*  So if America went there to eliminate this threat, and we also took out another country, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2926.96s)]
*  just for good measure, that wasn't even involved in it. You know, it's such a complex issue. And [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2935.68s)]
*  we're in the fog of war, I think everybody pausing for a second here, and just remember how confusing [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2940.88s)]
*  it was after 9-11, how confusing it was. And we had to figure out which thing these were Saudis, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2945.92s)]
*  these were this radical group, the splinter group, it takes a while to figure out what's going on [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2952.16s)]
*  here. And I do think on these campuses, they should allow them to protest, but there's outside [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2956.56s)]
*  agitators, that seems to me to be completely unacceptable to have 40, 50, six year old lifetime [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2963.04s)]
*  agitators on these campuses, allow these kids to, to protest, but to chase Jewish kids around the [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2967.52s)]
*  campus and then surround them and threaten them in 2024? I mean, I can't understand what's happening [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2975.68s)]
*  and how, how could an administration, Cheryl, allow students to threaten other students and [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2983.9199999999996s)]
*  not immediately snap a snap decision? It's a decision. You just said it. It's a decision. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2990.96s)]
*  It is a decision. Absolutely expelled. If a Jewish, a set of Jewish students surrounded a Palestinian [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=2997.44s)]
*  student, an Islamic student, a Muslim enchanted at them about what happened October 7th and made [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3003.6s)]
*  them feel threatened, expelled them as well. There's just some basic, basic rules of the game. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3010.64s)]
*  They're not enforcing. It's absolutely infuriating. But I just want to make sure I steal them on that [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3015.8399999999997s)]
*  other side. And you did, you know, I think very eloquently say you also agree with the suffering [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3019.7599999999998s)]
*  in Palestine needs to end. I know we're out of time. Can I say one thing? I really want to say [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3026.48s)]
*  attending Cheryl as much as you like. You have time. I really want to thank you all for this [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3031.68s)]
*  because two things happened in the last hour with you. One is that you were really passionate [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3035.68s)]
*  against the sexual assault and really clear. And as much as we need women to believe this, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3043.12s)]
*  we need male and male leaders. And so your voices, like I could feel the passion on this. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3048.56s)]
*  And I'm really grateful because that, that gives me hope. Like I am, it's such a dark moment. It's [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3054.3199999999997s)]
*  such a dark moment for democracy. It's such a dark moment for Jews. It's such a dark moment for women. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3059.76s)]
*  But this really gave me hope. And the second is your tears for Dave. Thanks. It's been nine years. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3064.5600000000004s)]
*  A lot of we've moved on. You have friends. I have a wonderful life that I'm so grateful for, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3074.96s)]
*  but the world still lost a really, really, really special person. And I, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3081.68s)]
*  I can see how much that means. I knew this, but there are very few things as you grow older that [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3088.96s)]
*  you realize in life that matters. And thank you. Friends are, that's it. It's just friends. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3094.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, at the end of the day, Tramoth, we're family and your friends. That's all you have. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3102.16s)]
*  I think about Dave frequently. And I just think at the end of your life, what you have [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3105.84s)]
*  is but a collection of memories and the memories we have with Dave, the laughter, the joy, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3114.7200000000003s)]
*  fake Tramoth, fake Tramoth. His wit, his insights, you know, we would be sitting at that poker table [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3121.92s)]
*  and it was like, we're all like 15, 16 year olds and we got this big brother who's 20. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3129.52s)]
*  And you know, we'd be bickering and laughing, whatever he come in and say, Hey guys, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3135.36s)]
*  how about this and this? So Tramoth and I would be jawing at each other. He'd say, Hey guys, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3140.7200000000003s)]
*  let's calm it down a little bit. And let's have a good time. Whatever. Thank you guys so much. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3143.76s)]
*  I have to go to my board meeting. This was, this was as deeply meaningful as it could have been. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3148.32s)]
*  Seriously. We didn't get to talk about anything business. I come to the summit, either come to [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3155.44s)]
*  the summit and you have a short video. We just need to know. Also, what's your view on crypto? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3161.6s)]
*  If you were to change any paragraph of the lean in book, we'll save all this for the sun. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3172.96s)]
*  Come really big hug. Thank you guys. And thank you for watching. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3177.92s)]
*  Wow. I need to take a deep breath here. Tramoth, Freberg. This was super emotional for me. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3183.8399999999997s)]
*  I didn't know if I could do it. I'll be honest. I have so many emotions, Tramoth, about day. If I [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3189.28s)]
*  have so many feelings about this situation, this is hard. When I watched the documentary, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3193.2000000000003s)]
*  I thought the most important thing is there are these, you said it, Jason, in the fog of war, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3199.2000000000003s)]
*  there are things that happen that are just wholly unacceptable. I remember when I was getting older, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3204.0s)]
*  I was getting older and I was curious, why did my family not go back to Sri Lanka? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3213.2799999999997s)]
*  What do the Tamils, which is a small minority, Hindu minority in the majority Buddhist population, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3221.2s)]
*  why did they feel so out of sorts? We were part of the Buddhist majority. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3227.2799999999997s)]
*  When you insert yourself into that struggle and understand where they're coming from, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3231.92s)]
*  it's jarring because you have to really re-underwrite, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3237.2s)]
*  okay, what are we fighting for? What are they fighting for? The most important thing that I [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3241.2s)]
*  got to is what is allowed because then you would see things. The unfortunate part of Sri Lanka's [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3245.44s)]
*  history was in the final parts of the war that ended it, there were some incredible atrocities [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3252.64s)]
*  that were committed. The United Nations and international court system tried to find justice [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3259.2s)]
*  for the Tamil minority population in what happened in those final hours of that war. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3267.28s)]
*  I don't think that they did for the most part, but it's just to show you that these things leave [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3272.4s)]
*  deep wounds that frankly can be reopened in a moment. It's very important that I think these [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3279.52s)]
*  things are, and I hate to say it so unemotionally, but documented. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3288.1600000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3292.3199999999997s)]
*  For those that don't even understand the Holocaust, if you go to the Holocaust Museum, [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3294.24s)]
*  if you're lucky enough to do it in Israel, I would encourage you to do it, but even in Washington, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3298.72s)]
*  you know the totality of what happened. There are certain places that document these important [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3304.3999999999996s)]
*  moments in history, and if this is one of those moments to the Israeli people, I just encourage [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3309.04s)]
*  them, please make sure that you minimize the mis and disinformation, as complicated as that [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3314.16s)]
*  may be to do. It is incredibly important so that you can create- [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3321.36s)]
*  And doing so does not dissolve empathy for the other side's cause or for the other side's [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3325.52s)]
*  motivations or objectives. Having empathy for the circumstances that happened here is the equivalent [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3333.6s)]
*  of having empathy for the plight of the Palestinian people and what they're dealing with today [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3338.96s)]
*  following October 7th. And I think that we need to recognize that both things can be true. We can [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3344.0s)]
*  have empathy for both sides. Yeah. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3349.44s)]
*  And by the way, humans have a way of making decisions, which I think is pretty predictable, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3352.16s)]
*  which is once you have a point of view, there are things that you believe are facts, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3358.56s)]
*  and then there's all this other stuff that you have degrees in which you believe that are [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3364.56s)]
*  essentially conjecture. The most important thing in really important debates is to move [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3368.8s)]
*  something from that gray zone into the box of facts. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3375.12s)]
*  So to speak. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3378.72s)]
*  And that is the only way that causes people to re-underwrite their principal views. It doesn't [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3379.68s)]
*  matter what topic we're talking about. So the more that we're able to document and actually [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3385.12s)]
*  make these things unambiguous, I think it actually has a really important role to play in how these [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3390.7999999999997s)]
*  young people view what it is that they're a part of. I'm totally pro-protesting. I'm totally in [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3396.08s)]
*  support of standing up for the things that you believe in. I'm not in support of overlooking [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3402.88s)]
*  atrocities. I mean, it's well said, Jamath. And the response I can tell you to this episode and [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3408.8s)]
*  the response I got for just tweeting, hey, this is an important documentary to watch, is the what [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3417.84s)]
*  abouts it, about ism, the other side, and documenting what's happening in Gaza. And we have this search [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3423.6800000000003s)]
*  for truth right now, which is very difficult because institutions have a lot of self-inflicted [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3429.92s)]
*  wounds. We live in an age of conspiracy theory, you know, and there are reports of crisis actors, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3437.84s)]
*  you know, in Gaza, creating fake deaths and fake videos. So now you have one side saying, oh, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3446.32s)]
*  the people of Palestine or Hamas are the numbers aren't correct of the number of people died, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3454.7200000000003s)]
*  the suffering is not correct. These images aren't correct. The fog of war is going to be thick for [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3460.32s)]
*  a while here, folks. And it's going to take us a while and Jamath is exactly right. You got to [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3464.32s)]
*  document this. You got to get to some ground truth. You got to get to some common facts. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3467.5200000000004s)]
*  So we can all objectively look at those common facts. And you know, listen, it's a shame David [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3472.2400000000002s)]
*  Sacks couldn't make it today, but he's really missed here because, you know, we have that same [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3476.96s)]
*  thing with the war in Ukraine. It's very hard for us in this current media landscape where we're [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3480.88s)]
*  quoting from news sources and anonymous Twitter accounts, fake videos is going to get worse with [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3489.36s)]
*  AI. It's going to be harder and harder to find the truth. And this is where your own personal [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3496.08s)]
*  morality, ethics, and I'm not sure who brought this up during our talk because I'm emotionally [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3500.7200000000003s)]
*  spent. I got to be honest. It's a little hard for me to collect myself here, but man, you know, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3506.32s)]
*  you have to have some basic moral principles here. Children, women, rape, sexual assault, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3513.1200000000003s)]
*  we all can agree on this. You said this in the week after October 7th, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3521.6000000000004s)]
*  Freeburg, you had a very powerful moment on the show that you don't want to have to decide between [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3526.0800000000004s)]
*  between October 7th being horrific, and children dying in Gaza being horrific. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3532.4s)]
*  And you don't want to have to be painted with one side or the other you want to [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3539.52s)]
*  believe as a moral person that all suffering needs to end. And we collectively as a species [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3543.6s)]
*  in 2024 on this planet can work together to just agree that certain things should never happen. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3552.08s)]
*  And to try to resolve these horrible conflicts. I'm so spent right now. And it was just very [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3560.8799999999997s)]
*  difficult for me to watch that documentary. I don't know where we go from here, gentlemen. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3566.3199999999997s)]
*  We're taking a 10 minute break and then maybe doing one or two new stories. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3571.7599999999998s)]
*  Take a break. We'll come back. Let's take five to 10 minutes. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3574.56s)]
*  All right, everybody, welcome back to the program. Yep, it's not easy to do a pivot here. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3577.52s)]
*  But we collected ourselves took a deep breath. And you've all been asking for a science corner. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3592.32s)]
*  And so there's a really important story that Freeburg has been educating us about on the group [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3598.0s)]
*  chat. There's a startup that just open sourced an AI gene editor. Yes, you heard that right. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3604.24s)]
*  Open source gene editor powered by AI. It's called ProFluentBio. Am I correct? ProFluent? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3608.0s)]
*  Yeah, Berkeley based startup ProFluentBio. Great. Have we talked about CRISPR and gene [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3615.12s)]
*  editing before on the show or no? I think we have mentioned it, it would be good as a primer [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3619.6s)]
*  for you to just explain from first principles, what is CRISPR, why it's important, and then get [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3623.68s)]
*  into this. So there's debate around who discovered CRISPR cast systems first and found their [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3628.24s)]
*  application. But generally, who side are you on the Jennifer Dutton side or the MIT? Is it [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3633.6s)]
*  easy? I'm an open source guy, which is why I'm excited about this topic today. Because I don't [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3639.92s)]
*  give a s***. I think things that are in nature are in nature. And I don't think you should be able to [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3643.7599999999998s)]
*  patent. I don't think you should be able to patent stuff that you discover in nature. So [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3647.2799999999997s)]
*  let's step back for a second. Freeburg explain what CRISPR is to somebody who's heard the term, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3650.64s)]
*  but doesn't actually know in your unique ability to explain science. Yeah, so CRISPR cast CRISPR [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3654.3199999999997s)]
*  cast CAS, cast proteins, CAS proteins are proteins that can go in to a cell. And they have what's [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3660.48s)]
*  called a guide RNA, little piece of RNA attached to them that allows that protein to find its way [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3672.08s)]
*  to a specific point in DNA in that cell, in the nucleus of that cell. And when that protein hits [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3678.8s)]
*  that specific location, it cuts it like scissors. And so the protein finds a part of the DNA it's [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3685.6s)]
*  looking to cut, attaches itself, cuts the DNA and a cut is made. And so this capability was [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3691.12s)]
*  discovered actually in bacteria. And it was an evolved system that bacteria developed to actually [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3697.36s)]
*  protect themselves from viruses. So the CRISPR cast complex emerged through evolution, where [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3704.4s)]
*  bacteria started to figure out that they could cut up viral DNA. So they made these proteins, [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3711.68s)]
*  these proteins would attach to viral DNA and destroy the viruses that came into the [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3717.12s)]
*  other bacteria cells. So scientists, arguably from Harvard, from Berkeley, and from other places [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3722.64s)]
*  around the world, in the early 2010s, started to do research and identified ways that we could [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3728.0s)]
*  leverage these proteins that we were discovering in nature to do targeted DNA editing in human [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3734.3999999999996s)]
*  cells and plant cells and other cells. So rather than them just being used as a defense mechanism [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3741.28s)]
*  by bacteria, that we could harness these proteins and make them useful to go in and do specific gene [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3746.0s)]
*  editing. Now, why would we want to do gene editing? Gene editing, if done precisely enough [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3752.32s)]
*  and efficiently enough, would allow us to go in and fix genetic diseases in humans, for example. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3759.1200000000003s)]
*  It would allow us to take T cells and reprogram them to go and attack cancer cells back in the [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3764.72s)]
*  human body. It would allow us in the case of agriculture, which I'm very close to and what I [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3771.68s)]
*  work on every day, to figure out ways to make specific changes to the genes of a plant, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3776.16s)]
*  to make that plant grow in higher yield or change itself to be disease resistant or drought [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3781.2s)]
*  resistant or other features that might be helpful to agriculture and to humanity. So gene editing [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3786.56s)]
*  became this amazing toolkit that emerged around 2012, 2013 and just blew up on the market. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3792.16s)]
*  The main original foundational patents, which are now mostly held after a lot of litigation [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3798.64s)]
*  by the Broad Institute, which is there's this joint patent arrangement with the Broad and MIT and Harvard, [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3804.64s)]
*  are being used in medical applications, they're being used in agriculture applications, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3812.3199999999997s)]
*  they're being used in all these different tools, but they're patented. There's royalties, there's [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3816.0s)]
*  fees, all this stuff. And in the years that followed, many other cast proteins started to [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3819.52s)]
*  get discovered. All these different types of proteins were discovered. And the reason you [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3824.8s)]
*  want to use different proteins is you want to improve the efficiency. So how frequently or how [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3828.8s)]
*  good are these proteins at editing the cell and eliminate off-target effects, meaning the protein [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3832.96s)]
*  isn't making cuts or making changes to other parts of the DNA that you don't want it to. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3839.28s)]
*  So there's been this search underway for the last decade for new cast proteins and developing new [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3843.68s)]
*  cast proteins and dozens have been discovered. People are trying to patent them. People are [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3847.84s)]
*  trying to make them do special things. They can only change one letter. All these different tools [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3852.48s)]
*  are emerging. So we went from having absolutely no ability to do gene editing just over a decade ago [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3858.4s)]
*  to suddenly having all of these different tools that could do gene editing really efficiently, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3864.1600000000003s)]
*  really cheaply, really affordably, really scalably, and more precisely. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3869.04s)]
*  So this company, ProFluent, they actually used an AI model, what they call a protein language model, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3873.12s)]
*  to create and train an entirely new library of cast proteins that do not exist in nature today. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3879.92s)]
*  So they basically took 26 terabases, 26 trillion letters of assembled genomes and metagenomes. This [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3888.3199999999997s)]
*  is from various species and start to simulate new cast proteins that could be useful to replace [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3896.24s)]
*  the ones that are on the market today or improvements on what's in the market today. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3904.24s)]
*  And they found one that they called Open CRISPR-1 and they made it publicly available under an open [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3908.16s)]
*  source license. So any startup, any research lab, any individual, any scientist can use this particular [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3914.56s)]
*  cast protein to go in and make edits without having to deal with patents and IP and claims on [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3922.08s)]
*  who owns what that they found in nature. And this particular protein that they identified is 400 [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3929.36s)]
*  mutations away from anything that they've seen in nature. So basically the AI model started to learn [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3936.88s)]
*  what sequence of DNA generated what structure of protein that was really good at being a gene [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3944.32s)]
*  editor. And they started to discover and iterate on building new ones. And the AI started to predict, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3950.96s)]
*  hey, this would be a good gene editor. This would be a good gene editor. And they came up with [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3956.88s)]
*  dozens of new gene editing molecules that don't exist in nature today. They identified one that [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3960.64s)]
*  they then sequence, they created it, they put it in a lab, they tested it, and it turned out to be [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3965.36s)]
*  much better than a cast nine. So they use an AI model to find a new guide RNA. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3970.7200000000003s)]
*  To find a new cast protein. So the guide RNA is just RNA. That's like the key. Think about [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3980.96s)]
*  a CRISPR cast system has two components. One is the cast protein. That's the giant protein that [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3988.88s)]
*  goes in and cuts DNA. And attached to it is what's called a guide RNA. That guide RNA is the specific [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=3995.04s)]
*  letters. And those specific letters are like a key and a lock. They go attached to a particular part [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4001.2s)]
*  of the DNA. And then that giant protein cuts in that exact spot. And so what everyone's been [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4005.36s)]
*  working on is new proteins. And they've been trying to find new cast proteins that aren't [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4010.4s)]
*  going to go do off-target cutting, that aren't going to make mistakes, that are going to be [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4014.4s)]
*  perfect at making the exact cut you want to make. So everyone's always trying to improve the [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4018.32s)]
*  efficiency and reduce the off-target effects of these systems. And so what they did is they [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4022.56s)]
*  tried to create a new protein that doesn't exist by learning from all of these other cast proteins [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4026.56s)]
*  that exist in nature today and identifying the three-dimensional structure of them and allow the [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4031.92s)]
*  model to predict a cast protein that might actually be better than anything that's found. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4036.64s)]
*  So it works around every single existing patent. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4040.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, that's going to be tested in the courts later, I'm sure. But they open-sourced it. So [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4044.48s)]
*  they're not claiming any IP on it. They're not making any claims on it with the patent office. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4048.08s)]
*  And they're saying, look, it's free and available. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4052.08s)]
*  I'm on the same page as you. This was occurring billions of years ago. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4053.7599999999998s)]
*  And it just took us billions of years to actually observe it occurring naturally in nature. It's [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4059.3599999999997s)]
*  absolutely ridiculous that a patent would be granted on that. Now, the implementation of that [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4063.52s)]
*  in a commercial use case, that's fine. Be able to have it. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4068.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is happening, I guess, in the psychedelic space with psilocybin, MDMA, and some of those. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4070.56s)]
*  That's such a leap. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4077.92s)]
*  No, no, I'm just saying there are drug companies now that are realizing the efficacy at Johns [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4079.12s)]
*  Hopkins, Stanford, where they're doing these. And then they're trying to figure out how do [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4083.92s)]
*  we take something that's occurring naturally, psilocybin in mushrooms, referred to colloquially [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4087.2s)]
*  as magic mushrooms. And then how do we bear hug this so that we can patent it? How can we own [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4092.48s)]
*  the implementation of it, as you're saying? And so it's fascinating to me taking nature [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4097.36s)]
*  and trying to patent nature. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4103.52s)]
*  There's a simple truth to all this, which is every single life sciences lab on earth is using [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4105.52s)]
*  this technology today. It has absolutely revolutionized life sciences. It has changed [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4112.0s)]
*  everything. It has reset the trajectory of human health, of agriculture, and of industrial [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4117.44s)]
*  biotechnology. Those are the three major markets where gene editing is useful. It is changing [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4122.879999999999s)]
*  everything. And so it is already a ubiquitous tool. We basically created software engineering [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4128.0s)]
*  for DNA, for life, with this capability. And so this system that these guys just published on, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4133.919999999999s)]
*  I think is a really wonderful manifestation of how AI is allowing us to open source and create [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4138.799999999999s)]
*  improved tools. And it's really important for humanity. And so I think it's just great to see [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4145.28s)]
*  happen. Yeah. Okay. Two questions for my baby brother with the science brain. Number one, [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4152.639999999999s)]
*  the LLMs here, how, maybe you speak to the efficacy of LLMs when applied to this vertical, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4157.5199999999995s)]
*  because it's a constrained data set, I believe. So it feels to me analogous to [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4166.88s)]
*  code. Whereas like, human language, images, videos, you know, building an LLM around them, [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4171.4400000000005s)]
*  you have like, pretty large corpus. It seems to me code is constrained, a video game is constrained. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4176.88s)]
*  And of course, maybe maybe gene editing is constrained. I'll let you answer that and the [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4182.72s)]
*  LLM component here. And then maybe you could speak to what this will do to the startup community, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4186.64s)]
*  being able to leverage this open source tool, have startup started to pop up around this yet? Is [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4192.56s)]
*  there a .org.com kind of equivalent here where you have wordpress.org, open source version of [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4198.64s)]
*  WordPress, wordpress.com, the hosted paid version. And are we going to see a bunch of .com versions [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4204.320000000001s)]
*  of this and different startups take it whichever way you like the two questions. I'm not super [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4209.68s)]
*  familiar. I've met the profluent guys a couple of times. I'm not super familiar with what their [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4214.96s)]
*  business model's going to be. But I hate that startups are worried or feeling covered by [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4219.28s)]
*  the patent landscape associated with CRISPR cast systems and that they can't build novel [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4232.639999999999s)]
*  products and move humanity forward. Okay. So it's a blocker for humanity. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4239.679999999999s)]
*  I'm hopeful that we do see more of these open source like tools become available and ubiquitous [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4244.0s)]
*  is almost the equivalent of having Linux where everyone can now, you know, as an operating system [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4249.36s)]
*  or HTML being standard code. I don't know if you remember to use before HTML five, a lot of people [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4255.84s)]
*  were using macro media flash. Oh, of course. Yeah, it was a huge blocker. Yeah, it was a huge blocker. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4264.0s)]
*  So you had to pay the license fee to create flash content. And then you had to, I don't know if they [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4269.679999999999s)]
*  sold consumer plugins. Well, yeah, and then you can get rug pulled, right? They could change their [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4274.32s)]
*  mind. And they were trying to make money on both sides. And so in order to show Microsoft and [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4278.16s)]
*  active to try to be a blocker and own the open source. So in order to put it, yeah, in order [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4282.8s)]
*  to put multimedia on the internet, you have used to have to pay license fees. And then HTML five [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4287.04s)]
*  basically created multimedia capabilities native to the HTML, which is open source. And so everyone [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4292.88s)]
*  could do it. And I think that it's really important that we see that happening with gene editing. I [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4298.16s)]
*  think all the applications of gene editing should be patentable and protectable. But the core tools [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4302.4s)]
*  are so powerful and important that I think it's very difficult and hard to see how we are [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4307.12s)]
*  accelerating humanity's progress by keeping these things at bay. And it's really great to see open [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4313.68s)]
*  source tools like this hit the market. Okay. And I think it's really important. And I think it's [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4319.5199999999995s)]
*  really amazing. Tell me about the LLM site here, the large language model being built around this [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4324.32s)]
*  data, how, what's the efficacy of that going to be like? And is my analogy of a constrained [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4330.48s)]
*  data set, meaning it will be able to perform at a higher level, like we see with code and then [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4336.8s)]
*  copilots for code. Well, they created their, their own LLM. They call it a protein language model. So [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4341.92s)]
*  they took all of this genome data that is generally very publicly available. There's a lot of this [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4349.92s)]
*  stuff published in open genome databases. You can download it, ingest it, and use it for whatever [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4355.2s)]
*  purposes you want as a life sciences researcher. So they took 26 trillion base pairs of data and [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4360.72s)]
*  basically use that to train their model. And then using that train model, they then started to [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4367.76s)]
*  run inference on it to say, come up with cast systems that are novel, that could theoretically [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4374.56s)]
*  have efficacy greater than what we see in nature with the natural cast systems. And then the model [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4380.400000000001s)]
*  started to output all of these novel proteins. Then they started to test them. And they found [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4385.6s)]
*  that this one worked really, really well after testing in the lab. So actually here's a great [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4390.24s)]
*  image. So here you can see basically in training the model. So it's, it's a little bit technically [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4394.32s)]
*  complicated what they did in the steps to generate this system. But ultimately the system yielded [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4399.84s)]
*  something that they could then create, put in a lab environment and in the lab environment, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4404.96s)]
*  test how well it worked. And what they showed was that it actually worked better than cast nine, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4409.36s)]
*  which is the primary gene editing protein use today. So, you know, pretty powerful set of steps [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4414.32s)]
*  and all unlocked by, again, freely available data and building their own model. And now ultimately [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4419.28s)]
*  open sourcing the best output of it. So, okay. Amazing job. If you missed any of those graphics, [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4426.639999999999s)]
*  you're listening to the podcast, go to YouTube and search for all the podcasts. If you want to [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4434.0s)]
*  see those graphics. All right, gentlemen, this has been another amazing episode of the all in [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY&t=4438.24s)]
