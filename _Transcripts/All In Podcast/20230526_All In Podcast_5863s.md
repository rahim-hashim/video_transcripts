*  Look at John Quincy Adams here. Yeah. Hey, hey, Quincy. How you doing? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=0.0s)]
*  hair [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4.9s)]
*  John Quincy Adams needed a wig to achieve this look he did he did I did it all natural [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=6.76s)]
*  I mean, it's a lot. It's a it's a look you're like some movie star from the 1970s [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=11.3s)]
*  We're still working. Do me a favor pull up a picture of Graydon Carter for a second and then put that side by side with sax [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=17.02s)]
*  Let's see just zoom in on that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=21.96s)]
*  Facts this is where you're headed by the way, you're headed to crazy town [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=24.6s)]
*  This is where you're headed. You can just poof it out on the sides and you get a little woof swoop on the top [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=29.12s)]
*  Bracy's this is where you're headed [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=34.88s)]
*  eccentric sax [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=37.4s)]
*  Pull up a picture of Steve Bannon's hair. He's a wise statesman [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=38.88s)]
*  I think this is what happens when you get too close to power [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=42.68s)]
*  You get more eccentric with your hair. So like too much power equals crazy hair now [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=45.34s)]
*  This is my theory Graydon Carter too much power of Vanity Fair he went hair crazy now you look at Bannon [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=49.86s)]
*  You get me a Bannon photo here. You start to see they go longer. They go [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=55.46s)]
*  Wafty they just they get volume and they're just like fucking I'm just I'm not gonna cut it [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=60.620000000000005s)]
*  I'm gonna let it go wild and of course that the old thing. He's the penultimate, but you look at Trump's hair [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=66.02s)]
*  This is where it gets truly crazy. This is where your head is X [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=71.42s)]
*  You keep getting this close to power [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=75.14s)]
*  This is where your hair is [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=77.78s)]
*  Glad this podcast never broke up because where would we get this amazing insight from J Cal if not for keeping this all together [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=80.26s)]
*  This makes it all worth it. It's very true. It is true. You get like eccentric and you get crazy hair [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=86.58s)]
*  This is men get too close to power and the hair gets wild unchecked power [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=92.38s)]
*  Unchecked hair. We had a good meeting last night. We had an all-in-summit meeting. I said free bird. Give me a call [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=97.18s)]
*  Let's catch up on this stuff. He's like, I'm in the bath right now with my candles and I'm like, yeah [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=102.06s)]
*  Okay, whatever. That's cool. He's like no no and he presses the video button and then I'm exposed I [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=106.84s)]
*  Kid you not to the most bubbles I've ever seen in a bubble bath [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=113.72s)]
*  I like bubbles and he is peeking his head out from over the bubbles and he's like look which had exactly [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  And I got his toes pointing out and I kid you're not there's six candles around the bathtub [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=127.56s)]
*  Like this is like the prince of panic attacks he had to come down for his phone call with me [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  So now when he has a phone call with me, it's so intense and everything's getting so intense with the summit that he has to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=138.26s)]
*  Do self-care? Yeah, I have to be emotion emotionally ready. He's self-caring your wife wasn't anywhere to be found [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  In the bathtub with the candles. I take a bath every night. Who are you romancing yourself or what? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=150.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think he was romancing the spreadsheet with the profit life of all its summit [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=155.73999999999998s)]
*  I have about 18 minutes of self-care every day 18 seconds, man. All right, let's get the show started in three two [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  Hey everybody welcome to episode [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=183.44s)]
*  130 maybe of the all-in podcast [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=185.6s)]
*  We're still here cooking with oil with me. Of course the dictator himself Chamath Pali hapateeha [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=190.28s)]
*  Principatic attack Sultan of science the queen of kinwa David Friedberg and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=197.0s)]
*  the power broker [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=202.36s)]

*  David sacks the Emperor of his new Republic [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=207.2s)]
*  Anybody have any interest anything going on interesting this week any interesting [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=212.06s)]
*  Moments for people on the national stage [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=216.34s)]
*  No, okay. Let's get right into the docket first around the docket [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=218.98s)]
*  Ron DeSantis governor Ron DeSantis announced his bid on the internet. Yeah on something called Twitter spaces and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  It looks like almost 10 million viewers have seen it so far across all the different spaces and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=231.54s)]
*  Donald Trump wasn't too pleased. He said Rob [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  my big red button is bigger better stronger and it's working truth because [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=241.62s)]
*  When Elon fired up the Twitter spaces it went to six hundred fifty thousand viewers in under five minutes [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=246.78s)]
*  And then blew up everybody's phones. My phone was melting [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=253.32000000000002s)]
*  I could have cooked an egg on the back of it the Twitter app crashed so many times [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=257.12s)]
*  but then sacks with his meager following of a half million people or something then [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=260.86s)]
*  Restarted the stream and so 15 minutes of technical snafus [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=266.9s)]
*  relieved and then there was a [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=271.74s)]
*  Announcement and I'll let you take it from there sacks [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=274.14s)]
*  You're gonna take you behind the scenes take us behind the scenes [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=278.18s)]
*  Just behind the scenes. How did it come together sacks? Oh, yeah, even better [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=282.02s)]
*  Yeah, the way it came together is I think the DeSantis team were interested in potentially, you know doing something different for their announcement [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=286.02s)]
*  He also did an appearance on Fox News afterwards and I think he did a town hall [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=294.09999999999997s)]
*  but I think they saw an opportunity to break new ground here in terms of presidential announcements by doing it on Twitter spaces and [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=298.24s)]
*  so the DeSantis campaign connected with Twitter and [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=305.94s)]
*  Elon and I agreed to kind of co-host the space [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=309.58s)]
*  And with him and he did his announcement now [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=313.14s)]
*  You're right [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=316.7s)]
*  We had about 15 minutes of technical difficulties because the interest was so intense at the time [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=317.38s)]
*  The room crashed it had over 700,000 people in it and there were it crashed because so many people were trying to get in it [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=322.66s)]
*  I think there was well over a million people trying to get in it [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=328.26s)]
*  So you normally don't have this kind of interest. I think this is by far the biggest [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=331.14s)]
*  Twitter space the the engineers there told me that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=336.18s)]
*  the previous order of magnitude was more like a hundred thousand not a million and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=339.14s)]
*  Then you combine that with the fact that Elon's account has over a hundred million followers [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=343.06s)]
*  And that basically led to a new level of scale and you guys understand that [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=347.46s)]
*  When you get to a new level of scale as a platform, there's always going to be some yeah some challenges [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=351.7s)]
*  So in any event the engineers were there trying to figure out how do we you know solve this and we realized the simplest thing to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=356.62s)]
*  Do it speed to restart the room on my account instead of Elon's and [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=362.82s)]
*  Then Elon joins a coast and we brought to San Jacinto and it all worked perfectly at that point [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=367.17999999999995s)]
*  The audio was brisk we had over 300,000 people in the room [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=371.7s)]
*  There was also another room that had been set up by Mario Nawal who's like a big Twitter spaces host and [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=375.4s)]
*  He had hundreds of thousands of people on there and then he had live commentary [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=383.04s)]
*  From people he invited and so this ability to fork Twitter spaces into many different rooms and each room gets to decide [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=387.28s)]
*  Who they want to be their hosts and their speakers allows you to do live commentary and in a way that you can ever have done [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=394.64s)]
*  Before so it was really innovative. I think [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=401.44s)]
*  Super innovative and for people who don't know Twitter spaces was really a rush job at Twitter [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=403.84s)]
*  They did that in reaction to Clubhouse. They it's just it's still basically a beta product that predates Elon being there and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=408.52s)]
*  It doesn't have yet [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=416.6s)]
*  The infrastructure or scale of the code base [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=418.68s)]
*  I don't think like YouTube and twitch do which you know have been working on this problem for I don't know 15 years [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=420.84s)]
*  Maybe the live products over the observations. Yeah, go ahead [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=426.8s)]
*  The first is I thought DeSantis did a really good job just rolling with the punches [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=430.24s)]
*  Okay [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=434.8s)]
*  Because I think whether he wins [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  You're not going to look back on this moment as the defining moment of the campaign nor whether he loses. Will you say that this was? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=439.48s)]
*  Where it was it all the beginning of the end instead what this was was a really seminal moment. I think in [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=446.8s)]
*  further divorcing [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=454.32000000000005s)]
*  Ourselves away from the mainstream media [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=456.32s)]
*  And you know that it was that important because Biden tried to troll [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=459.4s)]
*  The whole thing Nick you can show this link [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=464.68s)]
*  This link works and I actually think this is a really terrible idea by the Biden team because never respond basically [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=468.24s)]
*  Acknowledges how important the moment was [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=476.48s)]
*  And the fact that even the president of the United States was grinding the link [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=479.24s)]
*  And couldn't get in because there was so much interest is really important and I think what it speaks to is the fact that [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=483.92s)]
*  We are now [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=491.71999999999997s)]
*  Showing credibly that you don't need to listen to four channels to shape your consciousness [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=493.71999999999997s)]
*  And you can just go straight to the source and what SAC said is right if you now have a [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=499.84s)]
*  moderated [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=505.64s)]
*  forum [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=507.2s)]
*  That then gets put out to 50% [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=508.48s)]
*  That then gets put out to 50 or 60 different Twitter spaces all at the same time [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=511.08s)]
*  Framing and reframing it gives people a chance to come to their own conclusion in a totally unique way. So I think it was [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=518.12s)]
*  Really really an important moment for [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=526.96s)]
*  Citizen journalism and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=531.56s)]
*  Podcasting and audio formats and all of the things that I think we've been a small part of but I think that [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=534.12s)]
*  it's really must have tilted the mainstream media and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=540.76s)]
*  It tilted the establishment and you can see that in Biden's tweet. Yeah going direct. Yeah, so that was the first thing second thing [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=544.36s)]
*  I think the Sanchez did a really decent job in rolling with the whole thing and being [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=550.76s)]
*  Super cool and just being committed to the process and I think that says a lot about him as well [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=556.6s)]
*  Which was again, it's a question mark and I've said this before the big money guys [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=561.64s)]
*  Got close and then took a step back. So [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=566.8s)]
*  This could be a very good moment for them to reevaluate because I thought he did a very good job [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=569.5s)]
*  So I agree. So, you know, I was there I was live [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=574.0600000000001s)]
*  I was seeing what was happening behind the scenes when DeSantis came on after we you know [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=576.3000000000001s)]
*  I have 15 minutes technical difficulties. There wasn't a hint of anger. There wasn't a trace of irritation [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=580.4200000000001s)]
*  There wasn't any freaking out that we were potentially ruining his presidential announcement [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=585.94s)]
*  The guy was completely calm and more than that. He was in good spirits [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=591.74s)]
*  If you listen to the recording [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=595.98s)]
*  You know, he's happy. He was great. It was really good. I mean, and then of course, it was very substantive [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=598.9000000000001s)]
*  He spoke in a very articulate way about all the issues [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=605.0600000000001s)]
*  When congressman Thomas Massey came on to make a comment or question [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=608.14s)]
*  he was telling a kind of amusing anecdote about when they were in Congress together and [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=612.26s)]
*  Massey was one of the only members of Congress who had a Tesla [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=617.26s)]
*  But he comes from Kentucky so I think his license plate said Kentucky coal on it. Okay, why coal? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=621.6600000000001s)]
*  So anyway, you know the guy was in good spirits [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=627.02s)]
*  And so I think it does say a lot about what he would be like as a president cool under fire [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=629.7s)]
*  Doesn't get thrown off his game, you know again not an angry guy, you know [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=634.94s)]
*  Which I think will be a real contrast with let's say some of the other people in the race, you know [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=639.22s)]
*  Trump was sort of angrily truth thing during the whole thing, you know [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=644.3000000000001s)]
*  So I think it was a pretty strong [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=648.2199999999999s)]
*  The act of posting to truth social exactly. So the contrast between [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=650.2199999999999s)]
*  The personalities could not have been stronger now to the other point the term off about the traditional media [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=654.6999999999999s)]
*  You're right about what they were saying [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=660.8599999999999s)]
*  If you look at that the headlines this morning from traditional media outlets that really started [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=663.02s)]
*  Within minutes of the the technical difficulties the New York Times called the announcement of fiasco [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=668.78s)]
*  NBC News called it a meltdown [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=675.1400000000001s)]
*  Politico called it horrendous and you know why I mean if you know what I call that [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=677.5s)]
*  winning I [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=683.5s)]
*  Mean if they're losing their cool [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=685.1800000000001s)]
*  That's clearly they feel threatened by the fact that a major presidential candidate chose to go direct [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=687.86s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal headline is a scientist looks to rebound after botched Twitter announcement [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=695.22s)]
*  But again what they fail to acknowledge is and I'm not a dissent to supporter per se [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=699.94s)]
*  I'm open-minded to him, but I haven't decided one way or the other [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=703.58s)]
*  But this is a guy that managed to get millions of people in a nanosecond [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=706.0600000000001s)]
*  To be activated to hear what he had to say that is different than basically giving talking points and having surrogates [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=710.82s)]
*  Blather through Fox or CNBC or CNN to hundreds of thousands of people [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=717.5s)]
*  This is a really important moment. I think what happened. Okay, we got all the positive just to finish that point [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=724.0200000000001s)]
*  So if this was a political rally a traditional political rally that had started 20 minutes late [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=728.7800000000001s)]
*  Would anybody have said that was a disaster that happens all the time [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=733.82s)]
*  No, it was the crashing that made people be like all my phone crashed, you know, I was using the app [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=736.58s)]
*  I got crashed out of the app, but I had my phone did not crash [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=741.74s)]
*  So yeah, that's what I'm saying the app crashed a couple of times because your phone did not crash [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=744.44s)]
*  Yeah, but any event look this was at the end of the day [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=748.7s)]
*  This was a an event that started 20 minutes late. Once we started on my Twitter account in my Twitter space. It worked perfectly [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=751.7s)]
*  There's no problem [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=758.5400000000001s)]
*  And that's the recording that you can go on Twitter now and listen to we had about 300,000 people [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=759.5400000000001s)]
*  Contemporaneously in my Twitter space. I think Mario had a couple hundred thousand [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=765.22s)]
*  But if you look at the numbers today, there's already 10 million views for this thing [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=768.74s)]
*  Three to ten million on the replay and then that's what you have to look at replay because the world has moved [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=776.1800000000001s)]
*  to asynchronous like this was three o'clock in the afternoon in [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=781.02s)]
*  Silicon Valley and six o'clock. When was it in the afternoon? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=785.7800000000001s)]
*  In the afternoon, so you have a hysterical overreaction by the traditional media [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=789.46s)]
*  I'm simply don't like a that Elon is disirmeeting them by letting the politicians go direct and then B [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=793.5400000000001s)]
*  He's restored the platform being a free speech platform [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=800.34s)]
*  So they jumped on this the first second they could try and portray as a disaster [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=802.7s)]
*  But you know, there was an article in political this this morning and they were asking voters in Iowa what they think about it [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=807.02s)]
*  And they're like, huh what you know, it's not it's an elite thing. That's not yes [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=812.46s)]
*  Not even on the writer Freberg we heard all the positive here any constructive feedback on it or thoughts on it generally [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=816.98s)]
*  No, look, I mean I [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=824.22s)]
*  Would love to see all the political candidates engage in long-form discussion like this [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=826.3800000000001s)]
*  So that an audience can really get a sense of who they are and what they think in a direct way and an uninterrupted way [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=833.0200000000001s)]
*  And in a deeper way sort of like the conversation we all had with RFK last week and sacked it with DeSantis [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=841.22s)]
*  yesterday and I would love for [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=846.7s)]
*  the voters [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=849.1s)]
*  To engage in that content to better understand the candidates rather than key off of short talking points and short ads [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=850.5400000000001s)]
*  I think one of the saddest commentaries on modern democracy is that you can spend a dollar to buy a vote [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=858.1s)]
*  That all of these campaigns functionally try and raise capital [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=865.3000000000001s)]
*  To go and do advertising and that the advertising creates these little 30-second soundbites that actually change people's opinions and [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=869.94s)]
*  It's a really sad it will it they otherwise they wouldn't spend the money and I think it's a really sad state of affairs that [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=877.94s)]
*  We spend money to change people's opinions by shortening everything to a sound bite [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=885.5s)]
*  Instead of doing what maybe would have happened a long time ago, you know, we often talk about [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=890.9s)]
*  The town square if you lived in a village with 60 people and someone was gonna run for the mayor of that village [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=895.62s)]
*  You'd all go to the town square. You'd hear that person have a debate have a discussion you talk with them and that [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=900.6600000000001s)]
*  dialogue would inform your decision about who you're gonna vote for but you know with 300 million people in this country and [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=905.6600000000001s)]
*  You know short attention spans and jumping around from one thing to another [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=912.46s)]
*  There aren't a lot of great forums for any of us to really engage with candidates [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=916.1s)]
*  Particularly on the national level and make a better informed decision hearing from that person directly instead [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=920.26s)]
*  Everything is about driving narrative and chopping things up and getting the sound bite and driving the emotional reaction [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=925.66s)]
*  And I think one of the greatest things that's happening right now [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=931.4599999999999s)]
*  That you know could be a great benefit for this modern democracy is the sort of stuff that we've been doing on our podcast and RFK [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=934.62s)]
*  coming on board [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=941.2199999999999s)]
*  Like last week and what sacks did with Twitter and I really hope that more [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=942.5799999999999s)]
*  Politicians do that and that more people engage and consume that sort of content to make their decision and ignore the idiotic sound bites and the stupid [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=946.02s)]
*  30-second ads and the nonsense that you know third parties use to try and drive narrative [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=953.38s)]
*  So yeah, look, I mean, I think that's generally the positive trend that that I took away from it Jake [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=959.34s)]
*  I have some notes for sacks [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=964.42s)]
*  I'm always you know careful not to be too critical [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=966.02s)]
*  You know in the moment because I don't people will weaponize them and say oh Jason said this because you know [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=969.5s)]
*  It's Elon and he's team Elon or he's friends with sacks [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=974.9s)]
*  but I think [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=978.34s)]
*  Everything said so far this tweaked the media a great start [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=980.42s)]
*  The thing that I think was there were probably one or two misses here that I think you can build on sacks since you were [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=984.22s)]
*  very involved in the campaign with de Santis I [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=989.78s)]
*  Think it wasn't the free-for-all that Elon had said it would have been right? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=993.66s)]
*  So he pitched it as like hey [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=999.3s)]
*  This is gonna be uncensored and everybody's gonna get to ask hard questions and that didn't happen and you know, I think that is [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1000.5799999999999s)]
*  In stark contrast to what Trump did because I was doing the media analysis of this [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1008.26s)]
*  And so I think the follow-up needs to be where he actually takes questions [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1012.8199999999999s)]
*  Not from fans not from people who are already voting for him [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1016.86s)]
*  But really, you know a little bit more of the cantankerous people [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1020.02s)]
*  The people who maybe are voting for Trump the people who are maybe in the biting camp [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1023.78s)]
*  And that's what was the masterstroke Trump's [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1028.3799999999999s)]
*  CNN town hall he went into the you know [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1031.98s)]
*  The Lions then or what most people perceive was gonna be the Lions then and he took on all-comers [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1034.8999999999999s)]
*  He fought hard and that one was I think a bigger win. I don't think de Santis that was not a presidential announcement [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1040.1399999999999s)]
*  So just to be clear. Yes. This was a launch event declaring that he's running so in that context [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1047.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so you want to compare it to what these things usually are which is a guy standing at a podium [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1052.62s)]
*  Yes in front of his supporters compared to that. This was much more interesting dynamic and engaging [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1057.6200000000001s)]
*  I agree with you that at some point he's getting to step into the Lions Den do a town hall on a place like CNN [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1063.66s)]
*  And I think he probably will I think he did. Yeah, I think he did a town hall or here [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1068.6200000000001s)]
*  I think he actually did a town hall in Florida later that night [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1072.76s)]
*  So yeah, I agree with you. It just wasn't that kind of event now to the point about involving more people [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1076.3400000000001s)]
*  You know, one of the things I learned hosting this thing is there were literally thousands of people raising their hands [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1081.56s)]
*  Yes, you can't store it. I was scrolling through this in real time in the app [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1086.98s)]
*  I wanted to call them more people but it was just there was no way to do it [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1091.06s)]
*  This is something at scale they need to add to the interface which is [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1095.82s)]
*  Maybe pre populating a list sorting it by the number of followers whatever and this is my second point about this [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1098.98s)]
*  So I agree with you as an announcement. This was lightspeed ahead as like a full court, you know, like sharp elbow thing [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1104.34s)]
*  It didn't hit that note, but it can and that's why I think the follow-up [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1110.6200000000001s)]
*  You know having if DeSantis wants to come here and have like a two-hour discussion [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1113.5s)]
*  We kind of get into it a little more that would be I think really good for him [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1116.8s)]
*  Because I think he's got the potential to win over moderates and I don't think this won over moderates didn't win over [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1120.14s)]
*  Anybody who was in you know the left or in the moderate left and that was one of the things I noticed [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1125.82s)]
*  Is my second point about it is what a great group of listeners if you look at who showed up to listen [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1131.66s)]
*  Bill Ackman [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1139.14s)]
*  Michael Dell could you know what you see you know you source by your followers [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1141.18s)]
*  So but I think it's sorts it by the number of followers they have it sort by your followers who then have the most followers [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1145.3000000000002s)]
*  So you're gonna see it's a bit of a echo chamber that way. Okay feature. Okay, sure, but they were still very [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1151.38s)]
*  prominent people in the prominent people follow you [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1158.1000000000001s)]
*  Okay, but they weren't coming to follow me. They were coming to listen to this [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1162.5800000000002s)]
*  My point is still the same Michael Bell Ackman were coming so but that's why you saw them because they're your followers [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1165.5800000000002s)]
*  We all understand that they still showed up for this in the middle of the day [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1170.62s)]
*  I think that is really interesting and that yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's yeah [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1174.06s)]
*  That's all my point is it's really interesting that powerful people showed up for it full stop socks [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1177.86s)]
*  I have a question for you. What sorry Jason whenever you're done. Oh, yeah, and then I just had a couple of other ones [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1181.82s)]
*  Elon was a bit underutilized in this format [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1186.6999999999998s)]
*  And that's you know a challenge when you have Elon in the room because people want to ask Elon questions [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1188.98s)]
*  So this is something I think he's gonna have to you know contend with people wanted to hear Elon asked questions [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1193.98s)]
*  Then the people who are were asking the questions wanted to ask you one question. So you do get like a little bit of [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1199.98s)]
*  How to utilize Elon in this format? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1206.7s)]
*  I heard a lot of fact channel from important people like I wanted to Elon ask a question or maybe the two of them get [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1208.66s)]
*  Into it so for a follow-up one getting some people, you know [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1213.8200000000002s)]
*  Who maybe don't traditionally get to ask questions because let's face it in traditional media [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1217.38s)]
*  The only people get to ask questions are these anchors on news channels? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1222.38s)]
*  I want to hear Michael Dow or Bill Ackman ask a question [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1225.58s)]
*  That's the opportunity in Twitter spaces maybe letting Elon ask a tough question then a follow-up or you know [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1228.46s)]
*  Like we did here with RFK. I would have been totally open to that. I just couldn't manage it [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1233.32s)]
*  There was just so many people in the room. I didn't see Ackman actually [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1237.18s)]
*  I mean, I totally believe he was there but I didn't see only criticism people had of you sexes [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1239.94s)]
*  You're a major donor and you stack the deck was the most cynical version of it with like five people who were just super effusive [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1243.54s)]
*  But this is his launch party. So I think in that context [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1249.86s)]
*  I [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1252.66s)]
*  Would have called on Bill Ackman if I known he wanted to speak but I can see whether he raised his hand or not [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1254.22s)]
*  No, I didn't see him in the room. So what I was just to call on Bill Ackman and he's like guys [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1258.7s)]
*  I don't want to talk. I don't want to put him in that spot [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1262.54s)]
*  Can we get him on this pod so we can grill him about abortion and fiscal policy? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1264.94s)]
*  Who Bill Ackman? I don't know. I look I don't speak for the campaign, but I can put in the request [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1268.8200000000002s)]
*  You put 150 dimes in get him on hold on [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1275.1000000000001s)]
*  Can you can you tell us the actual tick-tock of how this whole thing came to be the campaign? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1277.5800000000002s)]
*  Within the last week or two had the idea of should we explore doing it on Twitter spaces? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1282.42s)]
*  and I think they were open to doing it and [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1287.38s)]
*  Sax didn't know about it when I put it in our group chat. Sax was like he is yeah, you found out about it [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1291.22s)]
*  I was being facetious. I was being facetious. Okay, okay. I thought you didn't go [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1295.8400000000001s)]
*  No, sometimes Elon will just tweet something without telling anybody. I just go to know [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1299.18s)]
*  I mean I help look the the Santa's people reached out to Elon and Twitter [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1302.5800000000002s)]
*  They also reached out to me about it and we discussed it and they were excited breaking new ground [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1307.2s)]
*  Different and I think they deserve credit for that. Can I ask a follow-up question just on the dissent this thing himself? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1312.2199999999998s)]
*  Because you've seen him up close [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1317.58s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1319.6999999999998s)]
*  why Schwartzman Griffin Petter fry [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1321.6599999999999s)]
*  Stepped in took a half step back [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1324.6999999999998s)]
*  And do you know what it's gonna take for them to just lean in and just make this effective complete so that he's really well-financed [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1326.4599999999998s)]
*  To beat Trump. I don't know what their issues are, but I did see I don't know this what's his name Petter fry or whatever [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1332.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I don't I don't know him but I did see a press article and he was referencing [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1337.48s)]
*  Book bannings so that to me just showed that he was buying into some, you know crazy left-wing [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1342.1s)]
*  I think that was the best part of and I asked I asked this answer about that [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1348.62s)]
*  So by the way for people that was the one thing that was new news for a lot of people was the book banning [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1352.4199999999998s)]
*  Can you explain the issue and the spin and the clarification on book banning in Florida? It's very simple [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1358.6599999999999s)]
*  They haven't banned any books in Florida [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1364.8999999999999s)]
*  The question is what books are taught in the curriculum and what's in the school library and some of these books were [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1367.1s)]
*  positively [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1374.46s)]
*  Pornographic, I mean they had so on to Santa's had an event where somebody was actually reading what was in these books and [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1375.58s)]
*  The mere reading of what was in the books actually got labeled on social media by the algorithms [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1382.62s)]
*  So there was a lot of stuff that's just not appropriate for kids [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1388.54s)]
*  No one is restricting your ability to buy or read whatever books you want in the state of Florida's ridiculous [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1391.8999999999999s)]
*  There's a legitimate question about what's in the curriculum by the way [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1397.06s)]
*  I remember when we had debates on campus [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1401.3s)]
*  About this is back a long time ago like the late 80s early 90s when they were throwing dead white males out of the curriculum [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1404.9399999999998s)]
*  You know Plato Aristotle Shakespeare people like that [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1410.4399999999998s)]
*  The people on the right who were opposing that never made the argument that this was censorship [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1413.7s)]
*  Everybody understands that when you're dealing with a curriculum you have to make choices. You can't teach everything [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1419.74s)]
*  So the question is what are you gonna limit it to? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1424.9s)]
*  And I think that when people actually dug into some of these books they realized that they're not appropriate [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1427.8200000000002s)]
*  So in any event his answer was along those lines that you know, you should go listen to it for yourself [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1434.0200000000002s)]
*  But I think that he did address that issue. I think he's kind of exposed it as a [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1439.1000000000001s)]
*  You know left-wing media narrative and I think he deconstructed it and I think that was helpful because I think there are a lot of [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1444.98s)]
*  Centrists who all they've heard about DeSantis is that he's banning books or you know [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1451.22s)]
*  Or the Disney issue which we also asked him about and we covered that I think so [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1457.0s)]
*  Yeah, the yeah, we talked about some of these controversies the issue here just to summarize it is the left is framing [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1462.4199999999998s)]
*  the [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1470.3799999999999s)]
*  Banning quote-unquote but just the not inclusion of certain books which are graphic that have sex in them [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1472.14s)]
*  From certain age groups in schools as part of a curriculum [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1478.66s)]
*  So they're saying these books are banned in Florida the more accurate way to say it is these books are not being used in curriculum [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1482.3000000000002s)]
*  You know for these age groups the parents if they want to buy them can buy them and then can read them [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1490.18s)]
*  So this is where this conversation is kind of breaking down [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1495.6200000000001s)]
*  And I think is a complete waste of time all parents want control over at what age or what stuff their kids are exposed to [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1498.74s)]
*  And so there is a thoughtful discussion to be had there and maybe the discussion is [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1505.98s)]
*  Should decide right? Well, yeah, of course, but it's not even a conversation. It's a hoax. It's a it's a fake media narrative [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1510.58s)]
*  they're trying to pin on him and [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1516.1200000000001s)]
*  DeSantis has been the subject and victim of these types of fake media narratives, which are deliberate [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1517.7s)]
*  I'm a conversation they're trying to disqualify the guy and they did this it this goes all the way back to Kovat when he opposed [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1523.82s)]
*  Lockdowns and kept schools open and they called him death Santas [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1530.86s)]
*  So the media has had it in it for this guy since the beginning because he refuses to go along with their narratives on things [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1534.54s)]
*  This is the same reason they hate Elon is Elon is defying their narrative control. So you put you put these guys together [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1541.6599999999999s)]
*  Okay, hold on even before the technical difficulties [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1548.1399999999999s)]
*  Let's be clear the media's heads were exploding that DeSantis and Elon were gonna be in the room together [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1550.76s)]
*  Look at the Vanity Fair article. The headline was DeSantis announcing with Elon because David Duke wasn't available [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1556.48s)]
*  Okay, the Atlantic was saying that this whole Twitter space was a hate group. I mean literally so these people were losing their minds before [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1563.0s)]
*  we even got into the technical difficulties and then they pounced on that that there was a [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1571.96s)]
*  20 minute delay they pounced on that as some sort of fiasco, which it wasn't will DeSantis [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1576.3200000000002s)]
*  Cut spending and cut our taxes [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1582.2s)]
*  We cut spending we didn't get into that [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1585.3200000000002s)]
*  So have you ever had a conversation with him about balancing the budget and federal debt? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1587.52s)]
*  Do you know his position on cutting like long-term capital gains and taxes position on that? I can't [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1591.68s)]
*  Let me give you the elevator pitch. I mean the nutshell for DeSantis is he calls it the Florida blueprint [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1597.96s)]
*  He's saying look at what we've done in Florida. Look at what we achieved at Florida. Let's take Florida nationwide [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1603.12s)]
*  Florida has had a great economy [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1608.6399999999999s)]
*  budget zero because I don't that's a state that's [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1611.36s)]
*  If you have zero tax you have my book [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1616.04s)]
*  Dictator has spoken if people want to look up this issue [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1621.1599999999999s)]
*  there's a book called gender queer and there's a story about in the New York Times and [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1623.4399999999998s)]
*  It's um, you know, it's a graphic novel about coming of age for a non-binary person, which is fine [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1627.84s)]
*  Great, but it's it's very graphic. It's a graphic graphic novel [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1633.72s)]
*  It has explicit scenes and these kind of books most parents would say I would like to wait [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1637.52s)]
*  I want a graphic novel on cutting my taxes to zero. Okay. There you go. It's called [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1642.76s)]
*  To write it come on guys overall great job and [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1648.52s)]
*  Yeah, get him on the pod here and we'll have a great discussion with him [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1653.0s)]
*  Yes, that's a great job, please invite him to our pod [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1656.5s)]
*  I think you know, we each have our own issues with or else we're just gonna go with the other Republican candidates Nikki [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1660.68s)]

*  Yeah, I think I think it'd be great to get Nikki Haley. That's a no. That's a no. Just say no [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1671.42s)]
*  No, no, I'm gonna put in the ass to the Sanchez for sure. All right. Well, that's great [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1675.72s)]
*  Yeah, it would be great people want to hear from more folks [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1680.5s)]
*  So a lot of other news going on I think a good place for us to go to next [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1684.6000000000001s)]
*  Maybe do we want to do the debt ceiling defense spending or Nvidia? I think those go together in my opinion [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1689.92s)]
*  Okay, great. We'll go with the Sultan of Science US debt ceiling is [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1696.5600000000002s)]
*  At thirty one point four trillion currently Treasury Department recently warned the federal government [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1700.64s)]
*  Could be unable to pay its bills as soon as June 1st [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1706.48s)]
*  Fitch put the US credit rating which is the highest rank of triple a on negative watch. So negative watch means [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1710.0s)]
*  It's trending towards bad and that it's imminent that they might lower it due to this debt limit deadline [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1717.36s)]
*  It seems like we're not making much progress every couple of days [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1724.04s)]
*  we seem to swing one way or the other the stock market has kind of shrugged it off and [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1727.8799999999999s)]
*  The last time the US credit was downgraded was in 2011, but we avoided that [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1733.8s)]
*  Chamath what's going on here? What do you think the eventual outcome in is there a chance that these [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1739.08s)]
*  Knuckleheads who represent us are going to default and cause chaos [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1745.1000000000001s)]
*  Or do you think this is all kabuki theater and we're gonna wind up in the same place [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1749.42s)]
*  Which is they raise it and make some modest concessions August 5th [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1754.02s)]
*  2011 [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1758.26s)]
*  the SMP downgraded [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1759.38s)]
*  The United States from triple a to double a plus, you know what happened? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1761.8600000000001s)]
*  Absolutely fucking nothing. Okay [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1767.54s)]
*  so I [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1770.3400000000001s)]
*  Do think that this is another opportunity for the little red riding hoods to get their panties in a bunch [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1771.78s)]
*  But these downgrades don't mean much of it to there [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1779.74s)]
*  I think that these third-party credit rating agencies are not particularly that [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1791.26s)]
*  Accurate and sophisticated. They don't know anything that you don't know [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1797.14s)]
*  They're not getting access to Moody's gave SGB and a rating the week before it went into receivership [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1801.74s)]
*  This is my exact point none of these companies know what they're doing [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1809.02s)]
*  These companies are in the business of putting a letter on a document and then selling access to that document [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1812.06s)]
*  So if you're gonna trust these guys to know what they're saying [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1818.84s)]
*  Either right or wrong independent of what side you are outsourcing your decision-making to the wrong body [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1823.34s)]
*  So whether it's S&P fit your Moody's I would tell you to ignore it and [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1829.76s)]
*  Come to your own conclusion. I think that this [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1834.44s)]
*  budget ceiling thing is happening now every couple of years and [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1838.0s)]
*  It seems like the real thing we should be talking about is whether Biden's going to use the 14th amendment and just ram a budget [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1843.28s)]
*  through [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1849.06s)]
*  Explain that's yeah. So under under the 14th amendment the president of the United States [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1849.96s)]
*  Has in their discretion the ability to make sure that the United States can pay their debts and [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1855.2s)]
*  That wasn't necessarily thought of as a way to work around the debt ceiling impasse [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1860.76s)]
*  But because Congress refuses to pass any structural laws that allow [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1866.04s)]
*  The budget to ebb and flow with tax receipts we get in caught in this situation [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1870.76s)]
*  Again, roughly every handful of years. So what Biden could do is he could say the 14th amendment [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1875.96s)]
*  Gives me the right I'm gonna pass a budget via executive order [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1882.24s)]
*  From a game theory perspective. What that does is it forces Republicans to sue Biden? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1886.84s)]
*  Take him to the Supreme Court and say this is unconstitutional [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1891.84s)]
*  The problem with that is that that probably really does tank the economy in the way that it creates enough uncertainty [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1896.24s)]
*  where capital markets freeze up and [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1902.8s)]
*  Liquidity just absolutely goes away. And again liquidity has been shrinking for the last 18 months anyways, so it get even worse [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1905.36s)]
*  So I think the brinksmanship right now between McCarthy and Biden is basically that veiled threat if Biden effectively isn't gonna get something done [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1911.92s)]
*  I think he's gonna test the 14th amendment now [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1920.2s)]
*  If the 14th amendment turns out to be a reasonable way in order to pass a budget the good news is [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1922.92s)]
*  Not just for Biden but for any future president including Republican presidents will not have to be held hostage by Congress [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1928.6s)]
*  They will in the 11th hour be able to pass a budget that works [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1936.28s)]
*  The implications of that though is that now you will not get consensus and [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1939.84s)]
*  whatever is happening in that moment you'll see more of so if you have a [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1944.44s)]
*  Spending president they'll just continue to spend and if you have an austerity president [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1948.76s)]
*  They'll continue to cut and that'll have implications on either side [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1953.28s)]
*  Sacks you think this is over issue is a 14th amendment or do you think it's a valid use of it? No, it's not gonna fly [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1956.76s)]
*  I mean, it's true that the 14th amendment has some language about [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1964.16s)]
*  The full faith and credit of the US shall not be compromised [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1968.3600000000001s)]
*  However, it's never been tested or tried so no one exactly knows what it means [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1971.44s)]
*  Progressives are now saying that the language means that buying could just keep spending without the debt limit being raised [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1976.5200000000002s)]
*  But buying himself through cold water on this [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1982.0800000000002s)]
*  He said that he didn't think he had that authority and even Lawrence o'Donnell the other night [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1984.8400000000001s)]
*  He was a big progressive on the media. He was saying that the Dems were gonna take this tack [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1990.0s)]
*  They needed to do it months ago before they started negotiating on a debt limit increase [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1994.68s)]
*  So it's too late now in other words if you're gonna take that position [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=1998.62s)]
*  Why would you have negotiated that you're you the president are effectively conceding? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2002.36s)]
*  You don't have that authority when you start negotiating. So I think it's too late to invoke the 14th amendment [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2006.46s)]
*  They're gonna have to raise the debt ceiling that being said [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2011.92s)]
*  I think they're gonna be able to Reuters had a report this morning that there are only 70 72 billion [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2014.34s)]
*  Apart now in their positions, which is a relatively small amount. So my guess is they're gonna they're gonna work this out [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2019.52s)]
*  Now what should the fate of the debt limit be moving forward? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2026.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean the thing that's so stupid about our budget process is we spend the money and then argue about whether we're gonna pay the [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2029.8400000000001s)]
*  Credit card bill the way that the debt limit should work is you raise the debt before you spend it [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2035.82s)]
*  Congress should have to vote first on whether they want a deficit or debt spend [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2042.6000000000001s)]
*  Then you decide how much you're gonna spend so this thing this vote needs to be moved up before they spend it [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2047.56s)]
*  and I think if you did that it'd be a lot harder for the politicians to spend money because [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2052.64s)]
*  You know if you had an up-or-down vote very early on saying should we even be in deficit? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2057.44s)]
*  I think a lot of people would say no, we're not and we're not in a war [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2062.68s)]
*  so why why would you deficit spend if we bring any thoughts in the debt ceiling if not, we'll go on to the [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2065.64s)]
*  The government accountability vis-a-vis the defense spending [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2070.88s)]
*  I mean look we're running a two trillion dollar a year deficit and it's forecast to continue to be at that level for [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2074.4s)]
*  several years and [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2082.1200000000003s)]
*  It's gonna take pretty [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2083.6400000000003s)]
*  Radical [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2086.7200000000003s)]
*  Changes and how we tax and spend to make up that gap. So, you know, this is a [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2087.88s)]
*  problem that is gonna continue and repeat and [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2094.76s)]
*  It does beg the question, you know, would you want to buy bonds from an entity that's [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2099.0800000000004s)]
*  generating four trillion in revenue and spending six trillion and has a plan to do that for the foreseeable future and it's only [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2105.32s)]
*  You know seeing its economy or its underlying [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2112.48s)]
*  revenue base grow by 2% a year [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2115.44s)]
*  it seems like you know, that would be a very hard startup to fund and [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2118.28s)]
*  It would be a very difficult growth investment to make particularly in an environment like this. So [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2122.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm just pointing out that this is a becoming a more kind of [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2128.44s)]
*  Systemically risky situation for the US that you know, we spend the way we do [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2132.88s)]
*  And we have to keep coming back to having these debates about it's as appropriate or not. And now they've narrowed down [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2138.96s)]
*  The way that the Republicans seem to be kind of going about getting this done this deal done is they're only focusing on the you know [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2144.36s)]
*  roughly 15% of the overall [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2150.0400000000004s)]
*  federal budget and they're saying we'll kind of make some tweaks in in that in that little range there and [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2152.36s)]
*  Save some save some pennies save some nickels [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2156.96s)]
*  But we've got a much more fundamental problem to deal with which is how do we stop running these deficits and running the debt up? [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2159.32s)]
*  But I mean, I don't sound like I'm gonna sound like a friggin [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2165.36s)]
*  No, I think you're right at some point [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2169.56s)]
*  Yeah, the inflation is here and the crowding out of private investment and private borrowing is now occurring because the government borrowing is so big [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2172.36s)]
*  I mean art or Treasury our government debt of what three two trillion? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2180.96s)]
*  That has to be financed somehow and all that money is going to finance government instead of being put to other uses [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2184.68s)]
*  So I think that the downsides already here. You can't run two trillion dollar deficits every year. That's unsustainable now. I think that [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2190.16s)]
*  You guys reference what happened in 2011? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2198.16s)]
*  That's worth this discussing for a second because I actually think that what was agreed to in 2011 was excellent [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2200.6s)]
*  Obama and the Republicans in Congress agreed to a thing called the sequester [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2206.48s)]
*  Where they agreed that they would freeze both defense and non defense discretionary spending [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2210.7599999999998s)]
*  until they could get their act together and agree on what the budget should look like and [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2217.44s)]
*  So the theory was the Republicans agreed to the pain of freezing defense Democrats agreed to the pain of [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2221.7999999999997s)]
*  Freezing non entitlement social spending and that's how the deal was cut [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2229.36s)]
*  I actually think that made a lot of sense and I think we should have kept operating under the sequester until we got to a balanced [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2233.18s)]
*  budget but [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2238.68s)]
*  The reason that broke quite frankly is because the lobbying power of the military industrial complex is so great in both the Republican and Democratic [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2239.88s)]
*  parties that [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2247.84s)]
*  They basically wanted the sequester overslept. Just keep raising the defense budget [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2249.36s)]
*  I think it's just that there's never been a degree of accountability for the spending that's being done because of this assumption that will [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2253.0s)]
*  always be able to pay our debt and will always be able to take on more debt and I think that you see [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2259.04s)]
*  The other conversation the other topic that we were going to talk about was this [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2265.12s)]
*  Lack of accountability and defense spending that you know, we should play the John Stewart clip [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2270.48s)]
*  You know where I think who is he interviewed the undersecretary of defense or something? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2275.8s)]
*  What is her title? Deputary Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks was discussing a defense budget [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2280.1400000000003s)]
*  When I see a State Department get a certain amount of money and a military budget be ten times that and I see a struggle [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2286.0s)]
*  Within government to get people like more basic services [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2293.04s)]
*  I mean we got out of 20 years of war and the Pentagon got a 50 billion dollar raise [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2296.56s)]
*  like that's shocking to me now I may not understand exactly the ins and outs and [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2300.92s)]
*  And the incredible magic of an audit [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2306.2400000000002s)]
*  But I'm a human being who lives on the earth and can't figure out how [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2309.44s)]
*  850 billion dollars to a department means that the rank and file still have to be on food stamps like to me [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2314.92s)]
*  That's fucking corruption. I'm sorry [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2322.12s)]
*  And then there was a story that came out this week according to Bloomberg the government accountability office [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2326.4s)]
*  Disclosed that the Pentagon is currently unable to account for hundreds of thousands of spare parts for the f-35 jets [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2331.48s)]
*  the Pentagon's never passed an audit and it's accepted and [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2337.12s)]
*  It's acceptable in the same way that it's acceptable to never [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2341.6800000000003s)]
*  Balance the budget to always spend and give everyone what they want and to find ourselves in you know [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2347.52s)]
*  This kind of late stage problem where we've gotten away with it for so long that both of those [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2353.92s)]
*  factors whether it's the [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2359.2400000000002s)]
*  Downgrade on the rating whether it's the fact that we end up in these battles over whether to raise the debt ceiling every couple of years [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2361.92s)]
*  Or whether we can't pass an audit all of these factors are symptoms of the same underlying problem, which is that there is no [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2369.32s)]
*  accountability for you know how we operate the [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2376.6800000000003s)]
*  You know the kind of fiscal condition of the the federal government, you know, the other thing it leads to is all these optional wars [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2380.12s)]
*  So let me give you an example. So all of these wars are always they're all free. Yeah, they're all off book [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2385.7999999999997s)]
*  So I take Ukraine we've appropriated what 130 billion. That's not part of the defense budget [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2391.2799999999997s)]
*  We have 800 billion in the defense budget [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2396.2799999999997s)]
*  But then we just stacked 100 billion or so for Ukraine on top of that and it's off book [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2398.52s)]
*  Now if we said the reason we're funding Ukraine is because it improves the national defense the United States [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2402.24s)]
*  Why wouldn't that just come out of the defense budget if you force people to make actual choices actual decisions and they could say okay [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2408.48s)]
*  We could spend a hundred billion on Ukraine or we could spend a hundred billion on [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2415.6800000000003s)]
*  Stockpiling tanks or f-35s or whatever for the United States now you actually force some prioritization decisions [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2420.28s)]
*  But because the wars are always off book [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2426.76s)]
*  They're just additive you just tack them on and we did that with in Afghanistan. We did that in Iraq [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2429.64s)]
*  We spent something like eight trillion dollars and that was just added to the national debt [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2434.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we can't afford these anymore. It's becoming clear to everybody that there has to be some accountability and Chamath [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2439.0s)]
*  I guess is [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2444.92s)]
*  Seems like there's a couple of unpopular stances to take when you're running for office [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2446.1600000000003s)]
*  One of them is Social Security [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2450.08s)]
*  Retirement age as we saw in other countries like France where people are arguing over 62 64 years old whatever it is [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2452.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and so these entitlements [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2458.6800000000003s)]
*  Job requirements if you want to get unemployment and then of course defense spending you seem un-american [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2461.64s)]
*  if you don't want to take care of old people you seem un-american and [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2466.8s)]
*  you know [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2470.52s)]
*  Weak if you don't want to support the government. Is there a path towards [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2472.04s)]
*  celebrating an [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2476.92s)]
*  Administrator as CEO an executive who tells honest truth to the American people which is hey [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2478.5600000000004s)]
*  We've been on a binge. We've been going on vacation. Nobody's looking at the bills and we need to have a staycation [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2485.5600000000004s)]
*  We need to cut costs. We need some austerity here. Is there a path for [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2492.28s)]
*  Somebody Ron DeSantis Chris Christie [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2496.48s)]
*  RFK whoever it is to win over the American public to win over moderates with an austerity and [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2499.2400000000002s)]
*  A balance the budget message or is it just too unpopular to even bring that up? I just think that you guys [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2505.6800000000003s)]
*  don't [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2511.8s)]
*  Psychologically understand how to get what you want. I [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2513.8s)]
*  Think the best way to get what you want which I would want to which is a healthy economy where there's accountability for spending [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2516.88s)]
*  is to not look at expenses and [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2525.88s)]
*  all of this talk is always about expenses but to look at revenue and [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2529.44s)]
*  Limit revenue more drastically and I think the best way to limit revenue [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2533.8s)]
*  Dramatically at the federal and state level is to just minimize [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2539.5600000000004s)]
*  Taxation as much as possible and I think that is something that Democrats and Republicans have a hard time fighting [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2543.36s)]
*  Nobody wants to raise their hand and say I want new taxes. Nobody says that [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2550.1200000000003s)]
*  Right, and I think that if you attach that to some sort of spending guidelines [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2554.92s)]
*  Like what David says with a sensible foreign policy you just end up spending a lot less you want to fight a foreign war? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2560.48s)]
*  Okay, great. Well, you know what? It's part of the existing budget. Let's go figure out why we want to do it [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2566.64s)]
*  We want to have more accountability and defense spending. Okay [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2571.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, look the defense budget is a half of what it used to be because we just have half the revenue [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2574.08s)]
*  I think that if you start to go and talk about austerity and cutting Social Security and health care benefits [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2579.0s)]
*  It's literally a non-starter people close their eyes. They plug their ears and you get nowhere [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2584.52s)]
*  Now separately, I think the step even before you look at taxation [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2590.52s)]
*  So minimizing government revenue is to figure out how to refinance [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2595.04s)]
*  So if you're a homeowner and you got a mortgage in the 80s, you were paying 12 14 15 16 percent [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2599.1s)]
*  If when rates kept going down you were the people around you didn't have the common sense to refinance that [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2606.44s)]
*  That was negligence [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2614.08s)]
*  Similarly, we're in a position today to refinance our debt wall and push out these maturities past a hundred plus years [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2617.08s)]
*  We are the only country that has a viable stable economy that looks like it can still continue to thrive at scale [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2624.4s)]
*  Take advantage of that you lose nothing by giving us the optionality [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2631.84s)]
*  generating some hundred-year debt refinancing a bunch of this short-term stuff and then second [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2636.7200000000003s)]
*  Inflation helps us and [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2642.0s)]
*  It helps us because it allows us to inflate the value of these dollars that allows us to pay off our short-term maturities. So [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2644.3599999999997s)]
*  These are two practical simple things that are uncontroversial [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2651.04s)]
*  that should happen today and [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2655.68s)]
*  Then separately I think you need to look at [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2657.92s)]
*  Minimizing revenue and then you can cut expenses. But if you flip them around, I'm just telling you [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2660.7999999999997s)]
*  I want any of this to happen, but I'm telling you nothing will change and you guys will [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2666.46s)]
*  Still be crying wolf in five years. It'll still be the same [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2671.6600000000003s)]
*  It'll just be a different debt to GDP number that gives you anxiety speaking of anxiety free break your response [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2674.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't agree. I think we need to balance the budget and I think that if we don't we what don't you agree with? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2678.94s)]
*  Financing pushing out hundred-year. No, no, I don't reducing revenue solves the problem [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2685.82s)]
*  I think that and by the way, one of the problems with a [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2690.1600000000003s)]
*  democracy chamom is that [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2693.78s)]
*  You speak about it as if everyone [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2696.38s)]
*  Benefits from a tax cut [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2699.2200000000003s)]
*  Generally, there's some disproportionate benefit to a tax cut and that's why it's less likely to happen because the majority will benefit [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2701.42s)]
*  By keeping taxes high for a minority whether that's some corporate minority or whether it's some wealthy [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2709.5s)]
*  Individual minority and that's why I think the opposite is more likely to happen [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2717.1800000000003s)]
*  Which is we're more likely to see taxes go up in order to bridge the gap to continue to fund programs that everyone wants [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2721.82s)]
*  Everyone wants an and they don't want an or and as a result [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2727.2400000000002s)]
*  They'll kind of continue to seek revenue because there are other places to get revenue that don't affect me [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2730.48s)]
*  Meaning it doesn't affect the majority and I don't mean me personally [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2735.42s)]
*  I'm just speaking about a voter and a voter would say if there's a way to tax other people [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2738.44s)]
*  For me to get the things I want they will vote yes for that and that's ultimately what the system ends up finding [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2742.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think that's what's more likely to end up happening. That's all facts [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2748.54s)]
*  Yeah, look, I mean I agree with part of both of what you're saying which is I agree with free break that we need to balance the budget [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2752.1800000000003s)]
*  There's no excuse for running peacetime deficits. That's large. We're really gonna regret this one day on the other hand [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2759.1800000000003s)]
*  I agree with Jamal that if you just try to solve the problem by raising taxes, the politicians will just keep spending [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2764.54s)]
*  I mean you have to starve with a beast I think in order to control it [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2770.5800000000004s)]
*  But at least that's been a view I think for a long time. Do you agree with Jamal on that point? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2774.54s)]
*  Here's the thing you cannot solve this problem by [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2779.42s)]
*  Raising up to 70% tax rates like we had in the 1970s and I can prove it pull up this chart [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2783.46s)]
*  France is a good example of this too. So what you see in this chart here is this is federal CSA percentage of GDP [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2788.54s)]
*  What I see when I eyeball this is if you were to put a regression line on that it'd be at around 17% [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2795.54s)]
*  with a plus or minus of 2% and [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2800.42s)]
*  The times when you get up to 19% [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2802.86s)]
*  Or a little bit close to 20% or we have great economic conditions or money printing [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2805.6200000000003s)]
*  So the Clinton era from was a 92 to 2000 was an economic boom and we got up to almost 20% [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2810.7400000000002s)]
*  but we've never ever been able to get more than 20% of [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2817.78s)]
*  GDP and federal tax receipts even during the 1970s when the top marginal rate was 70% [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2822.46s)]
*  What happened? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2828.5s)]
*  Why is that the people's doing economic activity it curtails investment and economic activity [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2830.7s)]
*  This is yeah, that was documented for hundreds of years taxation doesn't solve this problem. I don't disagree [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2836.28s)]
*  You can only get so much blood from a stone and the reality is is that when you try to [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2843.34s)]
*  Tax rich people in a confiscatory way. They spend a lot more on lawyers and accountants to figure out [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2848.3s)]
*  How to structure their income in a way that you yeah [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2853.38s)]
*  Or they tap out, you know [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2857.26s)]
*  like if you're paying 50 60 percent taxes like what's the incentive to go to work and [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2858.6200000000003s)]
*  If you're sitting on a big nut, you can just be like, you know [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2863.3s)]
*  You know [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2865.82s)]
*  And I'll just I'll just enjoy my life a little bit more because each incremental dollar [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2865.98s)]
*  5060 percent's going to taxes and then I have to pay my team and you just sort of [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2870.02s)]
*  I asked a question on Twitter, you know [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2874.6200000000003s)]
*  because we all talked in our group chat about the [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2877.2200000000003s)]
*  concept of passing a balanced budget amendment which would be an amendment to the US Constitution that says [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2879.5800000000004s)]
*  You know the Congress has an obligation and the executive branch has an obligation [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2884.14s)]
*  To generate a budget surplus [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2889.18s)]
*  you know every every year and [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2892.54s)]
*  You could have a balanced budget amendment that provides certain exemptions to this like in a year of war [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2895.18s)]
*  For example where Congress declares an emergency or declares a war and in those cases [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2902.54s)]
*  Theoretically like if there's some sort of emergency that we have to address and overfund you can kind of resolve to this [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2908.2599999999998s)]
*  But man, I said might [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2914.14s)]
*  But you know, we've been we've been at war [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2916.3799999999997s)]
*  For something like two out of every three years since the Cold War ended [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2918.98s)]
*  How many of those war sacks were voted on by Congress is the other issue, you know [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2922.5s)]
*  Well, what happened is we did the the authorization for the use of force [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2926.7s)]
*  I think goes all the way back to was it like 2001 [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2930.8199999999997s)]
*  Whereas basically we declare a war on terrorism in response to 9-eleven and they use that authorization [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2934.54s)]
*  To go into Afghanistan, which I think was understandable then they use that same one to go into Iraq [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2940.46s)]
*  then they use it to go into Syria and only recently only a few months ago do they actually [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2945.26s)]
*  repeal that use of force as a way to keep [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2950.58s)]
*  Authorizing new wars so they really should go back to Congress for every new war [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2953.82s)]
*  But the problem is, you know free work [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2958.02s)]
*  I agree with you that we need to have a balanced budget amendment [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2960.14s)]
*  But it's gonna contain a caveat or exception for war and we're just in at war all the time now [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2962.54s)]
*  Sure, but I think that there's ways to create some mechanism that forces that issue to actually come front and center as opposed to being what you're arguing [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2968.46s)]
*  Which is hey, it's always on the back burner [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2975.3s)]
*  Therefore it's always bubbling over and maybe you draft it in that way [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2976.66s)]
*  But what was surprising to me was just the incredible negative sentiment [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2979.86s)]
*  I got from so many people who are so [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2983.14s)]
*  Deeply have this deeply held belief that the only way to support growth in our economy is through federal spending and that that has become [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2985.2200000000003s)]
*  The driver that has become the handicap of our country. It has become the handicap of our economy [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2992.18s)]
*  It has become the handicap of our people and as a result in a handicap because it means that we now have this [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=2997.6s)]
*  Instead of having an incentive to drive productivity through [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3003.44s)]
*  Private commercial and economic activity through innovation through productivity gains through business building [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3006.96s)]
*  It's now dependent on what we have now identified is a highly [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3011.7599999999998s)]
*  Unaccountable system of spending and that unaccountable system of spending ends up putting a lot of dollars into the pockets of cronies and [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3015.7999999999997s)]
*  The pockets of folks that aren't actually driving job growth or aren't driving productivity [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3022.72s)]
*  There are certainly programs that work but overall there's no level or degree of accountability that asks the question [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3027.08s)]
*  Did that program work? Did we spend a dollar and get more than a dollar back for what we spent? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3033.0s)]
*  There's no assessment of that whether it's a war or whether it's defense spending. There's always some kind of intellectual argument [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3038.36s)]
*  That's not true. I don't think that's true [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3044.84s)]
*  I think the OMB releases report after report saying that all of this stuff sucks and doesn't do anything [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3046.3199999999997s)]
*  Just nobody [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3051.4s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. I don't care. I think what you're saying is inaccurate. This is my point [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3053.4s)]
*  I think it's important to get the facts right what you are saying is not true [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3057.32s)]
*  They do do an accounting that accounting sucks. It shows that there's tons of waste nothing changes. So now what do you want to do? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3060.08s)]
*  David is the real question. What do you want to do knowing that we shouldn't spend on things that don't have a positive return? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3066.32s)]
*  This is my point. That's why we're now in this very difficult situation. That's not happening now. What would you like to do? [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3072.28s)]
*  Well, the reason it doesn't happen is because the way that [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3077.64s)]
*  Politics decides things has nothing to do with the merits of it. It has to do with special interest and lobbying [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3081.12s)]
*  I agree. I'm just saying what do you guys want to do now? Just reality for a second [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3085.76s)]
*  This is why I think our education system is like fundamentally betrayed the country because we just keep teaching people that somehow the government's gonna [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3090.6s)]
*  solve all these problems when really it's just a product of special interest lobbying for things and [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3096.28s)]
*  That's why we perpetuate these programs that don't work [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3101.2400000000002s)]
*  I think the best way to think about government spending is that in every dollar there's probably [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3103.36s)]
*  15 or 20 cents that actually does some good [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3108.08s)]
*  There's probably 15 to 20 cents. That's like on the margins break even and then the rest of it [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3111.0s)]
*  Which is half of it is wasted. That's probably roughly accurate, right? [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3116.8s)]
*  You get things like TARP which turned out to be pretty decent program [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3120.86s)]
*  There were things like the DOE loans that you know got things like Tesla into the marketplace, right? [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3124.84s)]
*  there's things like the [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3130.2400000000002s)]
*  IRA today that'll delever ourselves and create a peace dividend because we won't need to fight over resources and oil from other countries [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3132.16s)]
*  But the problem is that that represents a minority of the dollars [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3139.6s)]
*  Okay, now that we know that that's true and we've known that that's true for decades. I guess again [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3143.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm just asking a practical question. What do you guys want to do now play the ball where it lies? [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3148.08s)]
*  What do we do today? There's a couple things you could do [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3152.48s)]
*  First of all, one of the points I'd make is I think you're probably right in your assessment that 50 cents [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3154.54s)]
*  What you're calling wasted that money does end up somewhere it ends up in someone's pockets [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3160.08s)]
*  probably the pockets of the shareholders of some contractor or the donors of [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3164.3199999999997s)]
*  Individuals or employees class? Well, there's also there's also individuals that benefit but functionally [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3169.2s)]
*  What's going on is it's a system of wealth transfer and that's not necessarily bad. The question is is the [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3174.68s)]
*  Transfer of wealth happening to the right groups that we intend to support with these social programs [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3180.48s)]
*  Or is it not and I think taxes point which I think we could all probably align on if it's not and I think that's [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3186.08s)]
*  Probably a set of standards for accountability that we should probably try and create [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3191.56s)]
*  But where does that where does that money end up it ends up buying homes feeding people? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3196.12s)]
*  They're going to restaurants. You're buying cars. Not like there's like a fleet of mega yachts in America [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3200.88s)]
*  Well, I I guess what I'm asking is where even that leakage of 50% doesn't that just end up in the normal economy? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3205.48s)]
*  Yeah, it ends up supporting individuals [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3211.44s)]
*  And they buy [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3213.44s)]
*  Here is what I'll say but that's what I'm saying it is a wealth transfer [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3216.12s)]
*  It is a system of wealth where it ends up in people's pockets and that that system ultimately [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3219.16s)]
*  Benefits a lot of people in need and a lot of people that we as a society intend to support here in the US [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3223.0s)]
*  I don't think it just goes to poor people [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3229.12s)]
*  Yes, there's so much corporate welfare, I mean come on it's not all just going to needy people [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3234.28s)]
*  Special interests on some level we can accept the inefficiency of government [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3240.2s)]
*  I like your idea of constraining how much of a canvas they have to paint with and how many how much revenue? [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3245.5s)]
*  They bring in and I think what we have to accept is that the reason this country gets bailed out is because we have [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3252.3199999999997s)]
*  tremendous entrepreneurs an [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3259.04s)]
*  amazing capital allocation system a very fluid [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3261.16s)]
*  Market for building corporate corporations and capitalism is so vibrant here that no matter what happens [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3264.88s)]
*  We always seem to make the next Google uber [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3271.12s)]
*  Nvidia whatever it is Airbnb and I can tell you you know spending a lot of time traveling [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3274.8399999999997s)]
*  Meeting with people in Japan in UAE, etc [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3280.08s)]
*  They're all looking at the massive entrepreneurial drive that we have in the United States to build global companies and how we do it over [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3283.56s)]
*  And over and over again and the only countries that seem to be able to do this at scale [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3290.8s)]
*  You know maybe Sweden and some of the Nordics obviously China [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3296.6000000000004s)]
*  But other countries have not figured out how to build global corporations [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3300.32s)]
*  And and that is what bails us out every time is entrepreneurs [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3304.28s)]
*  Allocators take out the deficit is getting so big that we can't bail out that way think about it [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3307.84s)]
*  We have two trillion in deficit every year that is to Google's [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3312.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's an apple [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3316.48s)]
*  Every year we have to we have to address it, but the point is that's how we have bailed ourselves out [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3319.0s)]
*  Historically is massive capital allocation and entrepreneurship. I want to remind you guys what happened at the end of the 70s [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3325.0s)]
*  We had all these inflationary problems [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3331.28s)]
*  We had all of these taxation problems where people thought all of a sudden 70% tax rates [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3333.68s)]
*  We're gonna solve the problem what you guys talked about and instead the exact opposite thing happened, which was the guy that got elected [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3337.76s)]
*  Ronald Reagan and I just want to remind you what the electoral college was between him and Jimmy Carter [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3344.92s)]
*  489 to 49 like a bigger [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3349.7599999999998s)]
*  Just shellacking. I don't think we've seen in modern US politics to the guy [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3353.92s)]
*  That basically said enough with this we're gonna tone it all down and we're gonna cut revenues [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3358.52s)]
*  So I do think that people have an appetite for them and I think that you know [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3363.52s)]
*  The debt to GDP in 1998 was only 30% [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3367.96s)]
*  So we just have a lot less dry powder to work to do we got a lot of work to do but let me say this look [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3370.9199999999996s)]
*  Jamoth, I actually agree with what you're saying in this sense [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3374.9399999999996s)]
*  Okay, if you look at my simple chart of federal tax receipts as percent of GDP, okay [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3378.2999999999997s)]
*  The highest it's ever been in the history of the United States is [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3383.4199999999996s)]
*  19.75 percent in [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3387.7999999999997s)]
*  2000 we had the dot-com bubble [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3389.64s)]
*  Okay, that's the highest ever been and we had periods of high tax rates and low tax rates. It never went above 20% [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3391.16s)]
*  So the simple math here is you do a forecast of what do you think GPs can be over the next year you get independent [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3397.32s)]
*  Economists to do it and you say the federal government can't spend more than 20% of GDP because we've never extracted [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3404.12s)]
*  That we've never figured out a way to extract [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3410.32s)]
*  Your logic is perfect out of the economy the logic is perfect there your aggression is so it's very important because what your aggression says [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3413.84s)]
*  Is we're actually spending a lot of energy fighting over two to three hundred basis points at any given time, right? [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3420.32s)]
*  Yeah, and what we should be focusing on is more important. Why are we doing that? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3425.56s)]
*  Why are we spending so much time getting our pennies in a bunch over two to three hundred basis points? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3429.88s)]
*  And we need to stop wars increase our education system [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3433.68s)]
*  Stop the wars by the way and inspire people to start companies and make it easy to start companies [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3437.16s)]
*  The BIL the IRA and the Chips Act all three the biggest components in all three bills. This is Biden signature legislation is [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3442.2000000000003s)]
*  Creating energy independence for America, which will have an enormous peace dividend. You will not fight these stupid [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3450.2s)]
*  endless wars every single one of them goes back to oil right like [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3457.04s)]
*  With the exception of it's always about resources. Yeah, what is it never been about resources in modern history? [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3461.16s)]
*  Well, and now it's gonna be chips is the modern resource Nvidia shares jumped as much as 30% after reporting huge revenue guidance due to AI demand [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3466.4399999999996s)]
*  Q1 revenue [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3474.7200000000003s)]
*  7.2 bill up 19% quarter over quarter not year over year quarter over quarter [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3476.92s)]
*  Revenue beat analyst estimates by more than 600 million for people don't know Nvidia is [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3483.4s)]
*  Working on GPUs as opposed to CPUs the graphic processing units that are being leveraged in [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3489.04s)]
*  AI and there is a massive cycle going on [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3496.1600000000003s)]
*  There's a line out the door to buy these when you see Twitter going into AI Facebook Google and obviously Microsoft [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3499.12s)]
*  All the cloud infrastructure is moving from CPU to GPU. Yes free birth [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3506.88s)]
*  Well, I mean I was talking with the CEO and CFO of a major data center read and they shared with me [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3512.3199999999997s)]
*  That they're seeing more demand in the last couple of months [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3520.12s)]
*  Than they've seen in the prior 10 years [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3524.44s)]
*  Almost all of that data center build out demand. So they'll build data centers for software companies for internet companies [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3527.6400000000003s)]
*  is coming from [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3534.6800000000003s)]
*  You know GPU racks and these GPU racks are much more energy intensive much more costly [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3536.6800000000003s)]
*  But it's a pretty kind of significant shift underway that businesses that historically didn't even operate their own [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3541.52s)]
*  Data centers are now building out their own data centers have their own training systems to have their own infrastructure [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3548.28s)]
*  To be able to run AI [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3553.88s)]
*  applications and [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3556.6400000000003s)]
*  Tools, so it's a it's a pretty significant shift underway all of the growth that Nvidia is projecting and [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3558.36s)]
*  Highlighted in this earnings report yesterday is coming from their their data center line of products and it's a pretty significant [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3566.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know people have said they've never seen a beat like this or never seen enough a [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3573.1600000000003s)]
*  guidance update like this of the scale where I think the the street was looking for maybe a [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3577.12s)]
*  Seven billion dollar guide and on revenue for this and they basically came out and said they're gonna guide to 11 billion next quarter [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3582.24s)]
*  Which is just an insane bump [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3587.96s)]
*  For a 90 day outlook. I was told from one of their major customers that they had to beg [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3589.96s)]
*  like he's and beg for thousands of GPUs and [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3595.24s)]
*  Like the lobbying effort said there's a line around the corner to buy these and you need only use chat GPT or any [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3599.96s)]
*  Stable diffusion etc. And you see how long it takes to do [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3607.08s)]
*  Generative AI to use these products. It's like we're back to dial-up modem sacks [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3611.84s)]
*  We're literally we're waiting for a computer to give us an answer [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3616.88s)]
*  When's the last time that happened that we had to sit there and wait for it to do its job? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3621.0s)]
*  And I think this is the great renewal for America another amazing American company. It's only three decades old [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3625.08s)]
*  It's best years. It's best decades are in front of it. Obviously [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3631.48s)]
*  This is gonna be a massive boon for yeah, not only a video but for America or as I say [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3634.96s)]
*  Yeah, Nvidia has basically joined the trillion dollar club now in terms of market cap companies. It's really amazing [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3641.48s)]
*  I mean, I'm kind of kicking myself because this was the easiest buy ever [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3646.72s)]
*  Chat GPT launched on November 30th. We all saw that that immediately ushered in a whole new era in Silicon Valley [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3649.92s)]
*  There's a ton of VC funding that's poured into AI startups [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3655.72s)]
*  They all need to train models and those models need to use GPUs. So we all saw this coming and [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3659.84s)]
*  I'm kind of annoying with myself. I didn't [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3667.0s)]
*  Let me ask you a question [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3669.4s)]
*  So you say that you kicked yourself obviously the general statement that you know AI is coming and Nvidia is gonna be a beneficiary [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3670.6s)]
*  Or Nvidia's products are gonna see a boon make sense [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3676.72s)]
*  But when you look at the valuation of the business, they are currently trading at 70 times [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3679.52s)]
*  the next 12 months EBITDA [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3686.24s)]
*  So how do you think about valuation even at a trillion dollar market cap at a trillion dollar market cap? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3688.72s)]
*  They're trading at 70 times next 12 months EBITDA [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3693.8s)]
*  You know, this seems like they're doubling revenue every six months though, dude, they're doubling revenue [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3696.76s)]
*  How high does it go cuz at a trillion dollars, what's the right EBITDA level for a business to be worth a trillion dollars? [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3703.04s)]
*  Is it a hundred tens on grace? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3709.32s)]
*  Right. Is it a hundred? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3710.7200000000003s)]
*  But I mean, what's the number and then the question is if it's a hundred billion [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3711.6800000000003s)]
*  How many years does it take them to grow into that and you know, are you really paying the right price? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3714.52s)]
*  Are you paying a premium to get you know? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3719.1600000000003s)]
*  It's a momentum stop now and will be determined if they have competition so is there competition for this company Chamath? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3721.44s)]
*  You'd think there's a competitor that will emerge that you know [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3727.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, it's important to understand what a GPU is maybe so sure Intel had the run of the place for the first 40 years [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3730.96s)]
*  of compute [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3736.88s)]
*  Because it turned out that most of the things that we use it for Excel Microsoft Word a browser [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3738.96s)]
*  Operated well on a CPU [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3745.76s)]
*  Which essentially think about it as like a factory that takes in the first order and then puts it out first and first out and the [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3748.0400000000004s)]
*  Great thing about GPUs is that it can take multiple streams of work at the same time and work on them at the same time [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3754.6800000000003s)]
*  Right, so it's very parallel and has this level of parallelism [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3759.76s)]
*  That makes it very well suited for AI applications. I think the thing to keep in mind is that it is a [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3763.96s)]
*  Byproduct of a GPU that tries to also do other things and so as a result of that you are now seeing a [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3773.36s)]
*  lot of companies building their own silicon and most importantly [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3780.32s)]
*  All the big tech companies now have some pretty well evolved efforts underway [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3784.6800000000003s)]
*  So a lot of these companies have figured out how to do custom ASICs that can do this massively parallel processing and what you're now seeing [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3789.1600000000003s)]
*  Is chips that are designed against specific models that are optimized for them [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3795.96s)]
*  The other thing that you're also seeing is that some people are saying well, you know what? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3800.7999999999997s)]
*  For these massive models actually you should just run it all in memory [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3805.08s)]
*  And so you're having folks that are doing it in in massive arrays of FPGAs [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3808.44s)]
*  That was Microsoft first attempt at all of this. So what is the point of me telling you this? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3812.7999999999997s)]
*  I think that again we talked about this last week [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3817.52s)]
*  the biggest cheerleaders of this first [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3821.4s)]
*  Point of value creation has really been Wall Street and family offices that wanted to front-run [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3824.7599999999998s)]
*  Where the value creation was going to initially go and they've been right which is around chips [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3830.6s)]
*  But there was a tweet and Nick I posted it [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3835.0s)]
*  Maybe you can throw it up here that shows that if you compare this to the mobile internet [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3837.4s)]
*  There's always this [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3841.7599999999998s)]
*  Phased approach in terms of value creation where let's just say initially in a new market mobile a decade ago in AI today [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3843.44s)]
*  The first dollar of profits tends to go to the chip companies that makes a lot of sense, right? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3851.72s)]
*  because they're the ones that are in the bowels of [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3856.48s)]
*  Making the elemental capabilities possible and [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3859.2799999999997s)]
*  Then you transition that value and what free brick says is people realize say hold on the profit dollars are not going to accrue there [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3863.08s)]
*  Because again this beautiful principle of capitalism is that you can only over earn [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3869.72s)]
*  For a certain amount of time because then competitors emerge and say hold on [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3875.88s)]
*  I want to steal those profit dollars from you and take them for myself. So margins compress, right? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3879.88s)]
*  So in the end and videos gains today will be then spread across Nvidia [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3885.0s)]
*  Facebook will have their own chip Amazon will have their own chip Google already does [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3890.64s)]
*  Apple will have their own chip all the memory companies will be in this space, right? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3895.8s)]
*  So then the profits get smeared their multiples compress then where does the value grow to the device companies in the mobile internet? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3899.76s)]
*  Here, I think we still have to debate. What is a device company in the world of AI [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3907.04s)]
*  But the most important thing I think to remember is that where the real value gets accrued is [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3912.04s)]
*  Five six seven years later when the software and services companies show up and create a huge moat [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3918.36s)]
*  And those are the Google's and the Facebook's and the Apple's of the world. And so it's a really dynamic moment [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3923.6400000000003s)]
*  I think it's wonderful for Nvidia. It's an amazing story for Jensen [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3929.8s)]
*  who's been really at this game for a very long time, by the way, there's a [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3933.1200000000003s)]
*  Jensen has a lot of his own that is a sort of companion to Moore's law called Wang's law named after himself [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3938.0s)]
*  which you can read about [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3944.1800000000003s)]
*  which just talks about the variability of [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3945.9s)]
*  The compute capabilities of GPUs versus CPUs. So if you want to know that he should get some credit for that [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3948.48s)]
*  But I think it's great. I think we're in the [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3953.88s)]
*  Apple is also making their own GPUs. That's what when you hear the m2 that has GPUs in it [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3956.92s)]
*  So yeah, you're absolutely correct. We're in any one [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3962.0800000000004s)]
*  So we're gonna have a few quarters for sure of this hype [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3964.3199999999997s)]
*  Mm-hmm, and then the smart money will probably figure out where the next the lily pad is and then they'll go to the next [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3968.48s)]
*  We said you've we said [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3975.3199999999997s)]
*  Any other thoughts free break if we wrap that up on that [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3977.8399999999997s)]
*  I wanted to show this AI demo from Adobe Photoshop, you know every week or so we see something that's insane [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3980.3799999999997s)]
*  Incredible and this one was we shared in the group chat. But for those who put this out [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3986.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so what we see here if you're listening is you know [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3990.7999999999997s)]
*  taking a [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3996.56s)]
*  Photoshop creating an area and then instead of like cutting and pastes pasting or refining it [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=3998.04s)]
*  You're putting in a text prompt and saying oh but [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4003.32s)]
*  Expand the and make this widescreen or [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4007.48s)]
*  let me grab this deer out of a forest and then put it on a wet alley at night and [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4010.7999999999997s)]
*  Then you know, let me highlight this wall over here and put a sign and put a red arrow sign and [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4016.56s)]
*  It just generates it and it's doing this they made specific note when they launched this that all of this is done with stock photography [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4022.3599999999997s)]
*  They have the complete license to so they can monetize this without getting sued like Microsoft is currently being sued and [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4029.04s)]
*  Microsoft actually in addition to the github lawsuit [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4038.68s)]
*  It turns out Twitter sent a letter over to [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4041.52s)]
*  Microsoft as well. So incredible demo the producers here at all in as our production team grows [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4046.0s)]
*  Producer Brian made a little video here. Here's Chamath in before the Lora Piana days [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4052.84s)]
*  That's that's Tom Ford. Yeah, that's Tom for this is when bad air terrible hairs terrible. You look tired [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4059.7599999999998s)]
*  The watch [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4066.68s)]
*  Night my god, I played poker literally I walked into that to that CMBC [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4068.68s)]
*  God really went straight from the poker table to the brutal to the squawk [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4073.6s)]
*  Brutal wait no tie, but he's wearing a tie. Yeah, that's a Tom Ford [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4079.12s)]
*  Yeah, he said to you. He said you must try this without them without a tie. I said, okay [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4083.7599999999998s)]
*  Oh, you know you were talking to Tom Ford great. What a flex. You know Tom Ford is all right twice in my life [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4087.2s)]
*  I can tell you both stories. Okay. Well, hold on a second [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4092.3999999999996s)]
*  I add make a yellow sweater is the prompt here. Let's see if he goes to Burt [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4094.68s)]
*  From Ernie to Burt. There he is Sri Lankan Burt as we call him in the [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4099.4s)]
*  Quite get the borders, right? It looks like a worries Jersey. Oh, there you go. Pretty bad. Yeah [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4105.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4110.8s)]
*  Change my [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4112.8s)]
*  Change his hair. Can we can we have the hair be less insane? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4114.8s)]
*  I think the demo was bullshit change his hair. Can we can we have the hair be less in sync? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4119.84s)]
*  Less Hassan Minaj and more give him I understand why they call you a Z's. I'm sorry [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4125.4800000000005s)]
*  I think the you had the hair going the hair. Yeah, it's a lot of lift. I mean, what was that day? [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4131.14s)]
*  What is that? Is it putty? This is like eight years ago [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4137.64s)]
*  Is it but are you using clay or putty? What do you yeah? Yeah, it's like it's like a stiff [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4141.6s)]
*  It's like a stiff hair wax. I think it's hot hair wax. Yeah [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4145.8s)]
*  I've come such a long way since that much more much more stylish [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4149.84s)]
*  I mean look at sax's crazy hair as we as we probably did in the cold open my thought on the Adobe thing for what? [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4153.64s)]
*  it's worth is like I [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4158.68s)]
*  Mean, do they want a mulligan on this 20 billion dollar figma thing or dirt? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4160.46s)]
*  Do they get to see the ongoing? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4165.6s)]
*  Revenues that figmas generating either on a person. They're the company to Lena con all kinds of stuff [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4168.68s)]
*  It's a different product though [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4174.12s)]
*  I mean the AI stuff certainly has had an impact but I mean so much of the benefit of figma [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4175.28s)]
*  Is it's web-based it's collaborative. It's like people kind of use it online to make stuff together [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4179.76s)]
*  It's a little different than the other tools that they offer today. So you don't think it from September to now [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4184.56s)]
*  like [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4190.4800000000005s)]
*  Nothing changes. They should just close this thing at 20 billion or [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4192.280000000001s)]
*  Or they're half they're half big you think that they should pay a billion [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4196.16s)]
*  Break it up and then redo the deal at 10 and then it costs [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4199.52s)]
*  Nine remember not all breakup fees mean that you can break up for any reason [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4202.76s)]
*  So there's only there's limited outs on what you can pay a breakup fee to get out of it one of which could be [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4207.16s)]
*  anti-trust or regulatory [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4212.4400000000005s)]
*  but otherwise you may be forced to close in court if you don't have a [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4214.52s)]
*  Valid reason for terminating the deal. Their only hope is to get Lena con to [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4220.0s)]
*  Muck it up. Yeah some leaks come off this is your argument more that they bought figma top of market pricing [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4224.56s)]
*  Which no longer makes sense or is your argument that they're innovating so well, they don't need it [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4231.1s)]
*  I think it's a little bit of both but it's it's more that I [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4235.44s)]
*  Think this generative AI stuff allows you to refresh I tweeted this out [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4239.679999999999s)]
*  So Nick, maybe you can put it up there [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4243.96s)]
*  But I think the first thing is that your feature set can catch up pretty quickly [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4245.12s)]
*  So even if you set out a team and said just copy exactly what figma has with a copilot [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4249.759999999999s)]
*  Enabling 50 engineers. That's like 500 engineers cranking on something. I would be surprised if they couldn't just replicate the product and 10 [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4256.36s)]
*  That's the first thing then the second thing is I think that you've seen VC funding basically crawl to a halt and [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4264.22s)]
*  so the question there is how many of those companies are just going to stop spending because they're just not going to exist and [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4271.58s)]
*  Then the third thing is if we're sort of hashtag austerity [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4278.7s)]
*  People are going to look at everything. They're spending money on and try to be really [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4284.18s)]
*  Disciplined about it if you roll all those things together sacks. My thought is [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4288.66s)]
*  Maybe the deal still makes sense [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4292.8s)]
*  But does it make sense at 20 billion and does it then just create a whole [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4294.24s)]
*  Suite of shareholder lawsuits after the fact that are just going to say these three things and regurgitate them ad nauseum [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4297.44s)]
*  That's the curiosity I had well, so we're here. Let's talk a little bit about the state of [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4302.36s)]
*  Silicon Valley sacks we were talking offline after the show last week [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4306.88s)]
*  You've slowed down investment at your firm craft you're being thoughtful you're working on the existing portfolios [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4313.4s)]
*  How would you describe your activity so far in the first half of? [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4318.96s)]
*  2023 as a firm if you're so willing to [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4323.04s)]
*  Share them my take on what's happening in Silicon Valley right now or tech more generally is it's a tale of two cities [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4325.68s)]
*  It's the best of times for AI startups and the worst of times to everybody else [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4331.08s)]
*  The AI startups there's a lot of interesting things happening in there and money is being pushed at them by VCs. It's very frothy [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4335.24s)]
*  arguably bubbly [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4342.92s)]
*  But then at the same time if you're a pre AI company [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4344.68s)]
*  Maybe the one that raised a lot of money at a big valuation in 2020 or 2021 [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4347.96s)]
*  It's a pretty tough time. I don't know of any [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4352.6s)]
*  Startup, especially like later stage startups who are hitting their numbers. Everyone is reforecasting down. Everyone's missing [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4356.12s)]
*  I think that speaks to the larger economy is not doing that [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4362.64s)]
*  Well, I think the economists a year from now may say that their recession had already begun certainly feels like that [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4366.400000000001s)]
*  That's what drugs at the zone conference and I think that startups are absolutely seeing that in their sales right now sales are slipping [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4372.44s)]
*  It's taking longer [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4379.16s)]
*  Buyers are sharpening their pencils [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4381.44s)]
*  It's a really tough environment [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4383.599999999999s)]
*  I think for software startups that are actually trying to make sales [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4385.16s)]
*  AI starts are a little bit exempt for that because people are still investing based on the dream [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4388.4s)]
*  Not based on the metrics and I would say that we're very interested in AI and we're starting to make some investments [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4392.48s)]
*  But we also like to invest based on metrics not just on a dream [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4400.18s)]
*  And so we're being somewhat cautious about how we approach it [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4404.3s)]
*  So you make a small seed bet in somebody who has a dream if I can translate here [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4407.46s)]
*  But if you're gonna make a bigger bet a series a series B, you're gonna want to see some numbers on the board [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4411.18s)]
*  You're gonna want to see some product in my I think it's a really good way of putting it because I think the standards [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4414.96s)]
*  Change at each round and in at the seed stage you can absolutely just make a [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4418.820000000001s)]
*  Bet based on the dream or just based on a founder sure great founder going after the AI space [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4423.18s)]
*  Idea still a little bit to be flushed out. You can make that bet but 500k 750 [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4429.9800000000005s)]
*  They were even even like 3 million will do as a big seed round [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4435.14s)]
*  But but then when you get to series a and you want us to write a 10 12 15 million dollar check [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4438.42s)]
*  We kind of want to see some revenue [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4442.7s)]
*  Yeah, and certainly by the time you get to series B or series C [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4444.7s)]
*  We want to see like all the standard metrics. We want to see net dollar retention expansion all that kind of stuff [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4447.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's really hard for the later stage startups because they raised and this is the lesson if you're raising [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4453.9400000000005s)]
*  At three four five hundred million sacks correct me if I'm wrong here [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4459.3s)]
*  You're not you have to build into that valuation and let's face it that valuation a was never realistic [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4463.14s)]
*  It was overpriced and then B you got the headwinds and your customers are saying oh you want forty thousand a year for this [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4469.900000000001s)]
*  Last product will give you twelve and what position are you in to turn down the twelve? You got to take the twelve [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4474.900000000001s)]
*  And because you got three competitors who are gonna roll up and take the twelve so it's hard [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4479.740000000001s)]
*  Can I give you an update please remember I mentioned there was a startup in my portfolio actually my angel portfolio. Yes [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4485.86s)]
*  That's a play around the cram down and I think it's absolutely tragic because of what I learned which is the founders got crammed down [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4492.66s)]
*  too because a year ago they brought in a professional CEO and [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4499.94s)]
*  I think as a result of this they're probably gonna get nothing for ten years at work [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4503.82s)]
*  Whereas if they had just cut costs damn it and you know that the company has 32 million of ARR [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4507.94s)]
*  So imagine if they cut their objects to a million a month they could have run 20 million dollars of EBITDA [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4514.5s)]
*  Pivot to the private equity model sell that company for 150 million [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4520.5s)]
*  Half would have gone to pay off the investors and the other half would have gone a lot of would have gone to the comma [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4524.66s)]
*  They probably would have made 10 million dollars each and now they're gonna get zero because they burnt too much money [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4529.1s)]
*  Didn't want to cut costs they bought into the dream of bringing the professional CEO is gonna re-accelerate growth [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4533.1s)]
*  Never down out never does and so it's like so frustrating to me because I like feel so bad for these founders [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4538.26s)]
*  I wish they had called me a year ago [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4544.3s)]
*  And I would have been one of the guys pounding on the table just cut costs and then control your destiny listen [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4546.22s)]
*  Yes [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4551.5s)]
*  And here's the thing is if you're only growing 10 15 20 percent even 50 percent a year you're not a VC backable [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4551.860000000001s)]
*  startup [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4558.860000000001s)]
*  You are a private equity place. You got to pivot to that model of making your business work as a cash flow positive business [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4559.860000000001s)]
*  Yes, that's how you're gonna get an exit and you know if you're growing 100% plus a year [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4566.46s)]
*  You can continue to be VC back [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4570.58s)]
*  So it's so important for founders to understand whether they're even eligible for venture capital anymore [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4571.9s)]
*  And if they're not you have to make a different kind of model work if you want to see a return [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4576.92s)]
*  Yeah, and when this happens a cram down round [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4581.74s)]
*  Those founders if they want a refresh they have to prove their worth [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4585.78s)]
*  They're not just gonna get a refresh to keep the relationship going. This is 30 million dollars in revenue [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4590.1s)]
*  They don't need the founders anymore. Look these guys been working for 10 years [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4595.46s)]
*  Even if they got a refresh that have put in four more years of work [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4598.24s)]
*  And the other thing is this cram down round I think was way too big [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4601.12s)]
*  There is 25 million with a 3x lick preff [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4604.84s)]
*  Look preff 75 million off the top off the top [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4608.28s)]
*  Big is triple. Yep. Oh my god who this is where board governance is so important. Huh? [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4613.28s)]
*  Like I mean who is on the board of these companies? We [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4620.48s)]
*  Was not [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4623.92s)]
*  On the boards of these companies these are people who've never had to build a company and [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4626.76s)]
*  they may be educated or they may have been an exec at a company and then some VC who was [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4633.28s)]
*  feeversely raising funds just hired some dope put them on the board of this company and then just the stupidity compounds and trickles down [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4639.92s)]
*  It's so frustrating compounding stupidity [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4647.0s)]
*  Beginning of the beginning all of these people who have zero judgment are gonna fuck so many companies up [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4649.72s)]
*  It is the beginning of the beginning. Well, it's a month. It's not just the the bad board members [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4655.5599999999995s)]
*  It's the view for so many years that who you put on your board didn't matter [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4660.9s)]
*  I remember there was all these VCs who had a model where it's like well [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4665.0s)]
*  We don't take a board seat and they were selling that to founders as a positive as a feature as a feature not a bug [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4668.22s)]
*  and the reality is for a lot of [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4674.28s)]
*  VCs actually not being on the board probably is the best they can offer but you know that model works [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4676.5199999999995s)]
*  That model works when everything is up and to the right where like this model of board seats don't matter [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4683.96s)]
*  Governance doesn't matter that is a model in a boom where everything just keeps going up into the right [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4688.92s)]
*  But when you had a tough time [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4693.639999999999s)]
*  That is when you need a board member who's seen this movie before who knows what a cram down round is who knows [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4695.4s)]
*  What's gonna happen to you a year hence? Yep when you get [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4702.5199999999995s)]
*  Screwed into taking a three. You want the gray hair pilot, you know in the right seat to say hey listen [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4706.679999999999s)]
*  We're going to hear you want that hair you want that sex here. All right free bird [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4711.0s)]
*  You are always candid about your own journey. You've had huge wins climate.com from billy [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4715.5599999999995s)]
*  Raising funds, but you know, sometimes things don't work out [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4721.16s)]
*  What do you what's your take on some of these hard lessons of great ideas, you know? [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4723.96s)]
*  Spun up during this really hard market [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4728.92s)]
*  I mean, I think just to echo the point you guys are making in the last [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4731.8s)]
*  15 years [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4736.759999999999s)]
*  we've been in a [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4738.28s)]
*  College structurally inflated environment because of the zero interest rate policy since the oh financial crisis [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4740.12s)]
*  And everything's been up into the right or so much [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4746.759999999999s)]
*  it's been so easy to kind of inflate things fill up hot air balloons and go up into the right and [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4748.5199999999995s)]
*  Unfortunately, most folks who are working [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4753.38s)]
*  In the investor community that are sitting on boards weren't around for the dot-com crash the last time this happened [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4756.44s)]
*  And I think you know just to kind of echo your point why it's so challenging I think right now to figure out a way out [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4762.28s)]
*  There are there's a lot of failure going on [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4767.24s)]
*  in [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4771.0s)]
*  In silicon valley right now, you know sacks you talk a little bit about having paths for exit and options for sas companies [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4772.12s)]
*  But there are many [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4778.04s)]
*  Sectors in startup land that don't have those sorts of options in biotech in syn bio in fintech and direct-to-consumer [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4779.24s)]
*  E-commerce there's a lot of markets that and a lot of types of businesses [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4786.22s)]
*  That feel like there isn't a great way out and it's having a deep psychological toll [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4792.62s)]
*  on entrepreneurs on founders on ceos and everyone [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4797.5s)]
*  Is experiencing some degree of failure in this environment. There are very few folks who aren't feeling this acute pressure in this acute pain [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4801.1s)]
*  You know, I heard some pretty horrific stories this week from a friend of mine and someone who ended up in the hospital because of [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4808.62s)]
*  The pressure he was under [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4813.9800000000005s)]
*  And it's really trying and you know, even within our friend group [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4816.54s)]
*  I mean not not our direct friend group within our broader community of [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4819.58s)]
*  Investor friends [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4823.26s)]
*  There are very few people who aren't feeling this extraordinary pressure that they've got a book [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4824.780000000001s)]
*  That is declining in value and they don't know how to get out of the hole [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4829.5s)]
*  and you know that pressure is like [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4833.02s)]
*  Is generates deep questions [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4835.740000000001s)]
*  About one's ability and generates deep existential thought for entrepreneurs and investors about what the hell am I good at? [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4838.46s)]
*  and no one's really [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4846.7s)]
*  Talking about this out loud, but it is happening across the valley. We all have these thoughts [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4848.3s)]
*  We all have these dialogues as the failure begins to set in in the slow motion train wreck of a market that we've all been [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4852.9400000000005s)]
*  Talking about for weeks and months. How do you deal with it? Look, I mean [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4859.740000000001s)]
*  I just think that number one it's worth acknowledging and it's worth having the conversation that no one is alone [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4863.740000000001s)]
*  Going through this pain. It is not a one-off that these companies are failing [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4869.740000000001s)]
*  It is that we are all dealing with failure right now and we are all trying to figure out [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4873.58s)]
*  What is the best path forward? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4878.46s)]
*  And it is the kind of thing that you just have to work your way through and you have to persist through this pain [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4880.38s)]
*  But this existential question of am I good enough? Do I have the skill set? I thought I had [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4884.86s)]
*  Am I just an idiot? Did I blow it up emperor has no clothes all the kind of inner fear and turmoil that everyone's dealing with [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4889.9s)]
*  You're not alone going through it a lot of entrepreneurs a lot of investors are in the exact same place [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4896.78s)]
*  now [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4903.02s)]
*  With respect to going forward. I think having integrity with respect to how you handle these situations and having thoughtfulness about [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4903.9800000000005s)]
*  You know your reputation because this is not a one and done environment here in silicon valley [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4910.38s)]
*  Failure is part of the process [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4915.4800000000005s)]
*  And how you deal your deal deal with people deal with investors deal with entrepreneurs deal with each other deal with your employees [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4918.3s)]
*  During these difficult times says a lot about your character and your ability that when you do this the next time [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4925.34s)]
*  It will set you up for success [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4931.179999999999s)]
*  And you know as any great athlete will tell you [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4933.42s)]
*  You build muscle during the times that you're failing and then you're ready to go and execute the next time around [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4936.38s)]
*  So, you know, let's save it for the next quarter, but let's play well as best we can right now through this quarter [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4941.259999999999s)]
*  Chamath clearly you want to jump in here? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4947.42s)]
*  What are your thoughts on separating? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4950.3s)]
*  Your identity from your startup from your work and having a more balanced view of yourself so that when things go wrong [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4952.7s)]
*  Maybe you're not as devastated. You don't wind up in a hospital bed when things go wrong [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4959.82s)]
*  They go wrong in bunches just like when things go right they tend to go right in bunches [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4966.46s)]
*  I called freeberg last week and I was telling him a story [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4974.54s)]
*  about two or three of my businesses just all [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4978.78s)]
*  Just pounding eating dirt [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4982.62s)]
*  And what I said to him was and then we have a mutual investment that's doing pretty well [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4985.58s)]
*  And I needed to use the one that was doing well to make myself feel better about the three that were eating dirt [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=4995.099999999999s)]
*  And I said to him something he was like it's just like nothing is working. I feel like [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5002.0599999999995s)]
*  Literally nothing is working and a place to be the only thing that you can do in those moments is just realize [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5006.599999999999s)]
*  It would be so much worse to just be on the sidelines [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5013.18s)]
*  Oh, I like it. And I think that's all you can do then you go out hang out with your friends [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5017.26s)]
*  Go hang out with your family kiss your wife [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5023.1s)]
*  Have as good of a time as possible outside the context of work and then you just start the grind again [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5027.18s)]
*  But yeah, we are in a moment where in most companies there is something pretty [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5032.06s)]
*  Wrong [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5037.42s)]
*  It's either your burn [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5038.62s)]
*  Product your track customers team cap structure and riff cap table. Yeah, and by the way, that's always the problem [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5041.26s)]
*  but it tends to be [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5048.86s)]
*  Balanced by a few things in your portfolio that are always going well [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5051.26s)]
*  So that as an investor you can maintain some equanimity through the whole process [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5055.5s)]
*  But freeburg is right when there aren't enough of these positives and there's just a parade of terribles. You're just like wow this whole portfolio [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5060.78s)]
*  Is it all about to fail and then I get a massive wave of imposter syndrome of like what am I doing here? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5067.2s)]
*  And then I have to recognize holy shit. This is my 24th year [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5072.88s)]
*  Take a deep breath [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5077.12s)]
*  And it's great that it's that that exhilarating where I think it's back to 2000. I just emigrated here [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5078.64s)]
*  That's the conversation to Martha and I had beautiful talking about like a string of difficult things [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5084.64s)]
*  We were all dealing with, you know a couple weeks ago. We announced [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5089.68s)]
*  That we returned all the money to all our all our customers [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5092.4800000000005s)]
*  At canna which was this molecular beverage printer company i've been working on for a few years [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5095.52s)]
*  I plowed north of 30 million dollars of our capital into building this business. We had two term sheets last year [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5101.280000000001s)]
*  both of which vaporized [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5107.280000000001s)]
*  As the markets degraded it was really a brutal experience for me and these were very high valuations and we were [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5109.280000000001s)]
*  We needed funding to get the production line stood up to manufacture that device. So we were that close [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5115.120000000001s)]
*  amen and [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5119.92s)]
*  As the market went south pre-revenue hardware companies became less fundable and despite our reputation and a great working product and a [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5121.6s)]
*  Manufacturing ready prototype. We couldn't get it done [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5129.04s)]
*  It was a really kind of brutal experience to go through [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5131.4400000000005s)]
*  The nose even after you've had a lot of success in your life. Believe it or not [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5134.72s)]
*  You still get a lot of freaking nose [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5138.08s)]
*  And you get a lot of I don't believe you and then to just have to get to a point with this one was really difficult [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5140.160000000001s)]
*  And there's you know been other kind of frustrating experiences of late and then you know [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5144.64s)]
*  You kind of have a call one day with another [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5148.240000000001s)]
*  Investment and you're like, oh my god, this thing could be a home run [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5150.94s)]
*  And that just comes out of nowhere and you know as long as we kind of stay in it [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5154.879999999999s)]
*  As an investor and you keep you know as a builder and you kind of keep building [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5159.679999999999s)]
*  You don't know when that good knock on the door is going to come. Yep. You got to stay in the game [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5163.92s)]
*  You're building a business and one day you just nail a sale that you just weren't expecting or a partnership [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5169.2s)]
*  Or an m&a inbound or something that happens that you weren't expecting it pays for all the pain [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5174.96s)]
*  And all the loss and all the turmoil and all the downside. I always used to tell people [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5180.88s)]
*  For every you know, four days i'd be failing i'd have one day of success [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5184.96s)]
*  But that one day of success will get me slightly ahead of where I was at the start of the week [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5188.400000000001s)]
*  But 80 of it was failing. I mean right now it's like 19 days of failure and one day of success [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5192.400000000001s)]
*  But that one day of success the goal is you used to have a couple of those punctuated moments [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5197.12s)]
*  That are big enough that make up for all this stuff if you just keep grinding [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5200.8s)]
*  And if you just keep grinding as an entrepreneur you keep grinding as an investor and stay in the game [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5205.52s)]
*  You're describing living with the power law, yeah, there's a very relatable poker analogy in this [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5211.4400000000005s)]
*  There's a there's a guy that makes poker content. His name is jonathan little. He's great. He'll be at the angel summit [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5215.68s)]
*  He's wonderful. I've been thinking about hopping into one tournament at the wsop this year [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5220.88s)]
*  It's one of the big buying tournaments. So i'm like, let me just take a little tournament refresher [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5225.84s)]
*  And I was just looking for any content and I found his and he had this beautiful slide [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5230.32s)]
*  Which he said [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5235.599999999999s)]
*  If you are a mid-level poker player [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5237.839999999999s)]
*  You should expect to final table [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5241.92s)]
*  Every one in a hundred tournaments roughly [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5246.24s)]
*  And I thought about that for a second and I was like that's a one percent success rate [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5250.4s)]
*  Now if that is your 99th tournament [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5255.6s)]
*  You have to be pretty resilient to go through 98 losses where you don't cash [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5258.400000000001s)]
*  You don't make the money and you're just putting money out [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5262.8s)]
*  You're deep in a j curve and you're like is this ever going to work out for me? [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5265.4400000000005s)]
*  And so it's a really really good reminder that it is the grind [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5268.64s)]
*  Yep [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5273.4400000000005s)]
*  And I thought that was really interesting. You had a you had a single or double I guess [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5274.400000000001s)]
*  With call-in maybe you could talk a little bit about that experience and what decision you made there [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5279.36s)]
*  We were obviously investors who were a bit collected, but i'd love to hear your candid thoughts on why you decided to sell [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5283.92s)]
*  Yeah, we put together a great team and they built an amazing product [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5289.52s)]
*  I think it's by far the best sort of social audio product and actually they added video to it as well and podcasting features [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5292.32s)]
*  So it's kind of the synthesis of video and audio podcasting with social audio. We got acquired by rumble [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5299.36s)]
*  It's sort of like a base hit type acquisition [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5305.6s)]
*  It's it's a small deal relatively speaking [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5307.92s)]
*  But the team wanted to do it and then the main reason is because we got to hundreds of thousands of users [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5310.48s)]
*  But in the consumer space you really need to get to millions and frankly tens of millions is what it takes to have a successful [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5316.0s)]
*  Consumer product rumble does have tens of millions of users [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5323.28s)]
*  So the team wanted to find a home and there's a lot of synergy with rumble both companies [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5327.5199999999995s)]
*  Have a mission that's aligned around free speech rumble sort of the call it free speech alternative to youtube [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5333.92s)]
*  It's a video platform [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5339.44s)]
*  And what colin will do is give rumble studio capabilities. So it'll be very synergistic for all their creators to be able to create [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5341.2s)]
*  Content in colin and then post it in rumble [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5348.0s)]
*  So it's not you know, a huge outcome for anyone. It's sort of a push for the investors depending on where rumble stock ends up [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5351.84s)]
*  But look, it's just you can build a really great product and a great team [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5358.4s)]
*  But unless you hit that lighting in a bottle with distribution, you know, you won't get to the next level [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5361.2s)]
*  So i'm i'm happy about the deal. I think the team's happy about the deal [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5366.32s)]
*  And it's a good outcome for for everybody involved, but it's not you know, it's not a home run [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5370.08s)]
*  It's just it's more of a base head and that's what most these things are [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5374.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah getting used to a high failure rate and living inside the power law where one investment out of 30 or 40 or 50 [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5378.32s)]
*  Results in 90 of your funds returns for you know, that specific fund or so or maybe two wins represent 95 [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5386.96s)]
*  That's a hard thing for the human brain to handle as is the j curve as chamath [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5394.24s)]
*  You know points out correctly man [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5399.12s)]
*  You invest for two or three years and then you watch that all those things go down in value for two or three years [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5401.12s)]
*  Or the value i'm sure of the portfolio go down for two three years before it actually rebounds and goes back up. I remember [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5405.2s)]
*  Man, I had a run where everything I touched turned to gold and then mahalo hit 10 million in revenue and then boom panda update [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5411.36s)]
*  And it just goes up in smoke and you're like [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5417.759999999999s)]
*  What what just happened I I saw web logs 18 months after starting it I you know had the silicon eye report I just [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5419.92s)]
*  Uber investment everything I touched [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5425.6s)]
*  Went to the moon working. Yeah [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5427.68s)]
*  Yeah [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5429.280000000001s)]
*  And then it's just a very frustrating experience where you can't make something work and you know, like I should be able to make this [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5429.52s)]
*  Work, why isn't it working? [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5434.96s)]
*  There's a very heavy blanket of humility setting over silicon valley right now [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5436.24s)]
*  And I think all of us who have had strings of successes and repeat successes and you know [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5440.72s)]
*  Things that we touch have worked and we do all the same things and we do the right things and we do them the same [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5446.240000000001s)]
*  Way in the right way and it doesn't work and then it doesn't work again and it doesn't work again [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5451.200000000001s)]
*  It creates a very different psyche whether you're an entrepreneur building a business or an investor investing in businesses [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5456.160000000001s)]
*  That what used to be the case isn't the case anymore as the tides have shifted [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5462.88s)]
*  It's uh, it's it's it's a daunting challenge to work your way psychologically through this moment [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5467.68s)]
*  but you know [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5473.84s)]
*  Progress doesn't change innovation isn't going to stop technology isn't going to keep shifting forward [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5475.12s)]
*  And the opportunities to continue to build and innovate are not going away [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5480.24s)]
*  So I for one am deeply optimistic and excited about what the future holds [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5484.72s)]
*  But man, you got to put your freaking game face on right now to get through this. Yeah for sure [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5488.72s)]
*  Well, yeah, and I would say there's one other exogenous variable here, which is I don't think any of us realized how much [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5492.64s)]
*  Our sentiment was affected by one guy's decision [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5499.599999999999s)]
*  At the fed, yeah, like what interests are gonna be invisible hands the invisible hands [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5504.18s)]
*  You know what when there's a lot of money in the system, everyone feels great [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5509.14s)]
*  And all the portfolios look great and when the money is being sucked out of the system the buyers are buying and oh my god [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5512.66s)]
*  Like when the money is being sucked out of the system, everyone's results look terrible. Yep [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5518.26s)]
*  It's you know what? It's like before a tsunami the big wave gets pulled out and then this tsunami comes in [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5522.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's literally we're getting pulled out [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5527.22s)]
*  The money is being sucked out of the system like the tie before tsunami and the tsunami is going to be all the [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5529.38s)]
*  failures and bankruptcies [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5534.820000000001s)]
*  But what I would say is just in the same way that things weren't as good as they appeared to be [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5536.1s)]
*  During the asset bubble [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5541.3s)]
*  They're probably not as bad as they appear to be now. However, you have to give yourself time to get through this [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5543.54s)]
*  Sort of a recessionary cycle and it's so frustrating to me when founders don't want to cut [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIvDVy5lNHE&t=5550.26s)]
