*  poker Sean made octopus and left some raw octopus in a garbage bag outside and Joker and Joker ate it and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=369.88s)]
*  He got such terrible poisoning. We had to take him to the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=377.0s)]
*  To the emergency animal hospital where he stayed for like a week. That was by the way 17 K [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  But ever since he came back he's been completely incontinent [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=387.0s)]
*  So I was done that Nat and I now just wake up half an hour early and what we do now from 630 to usually [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=391.24s)]
*  645 is we're cleaning up some form of feces that he's left somewhere [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=397.96s)]
*  To go and find where did he take his let's go clean it up [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=402.88s)]
*  And the worst one was he once pooped through one of the greats [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=406.56s)]
*  With this really bad poo and I had to go and just fetch it all out. It was just this right in the great [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=411.52s)]
*  It's fantastic right in the yeah. So there you have it folks go adopt a pet [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=416.96s)]
*  There's your endorsement [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=420.92s)]
*  for the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=423.04s)]
*  $17,000 in veterinary bills and cleaning up all day long and [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=424.6s)]
*  Replacing carpets listen, we got a big docket today [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=430.04s)]
*  I know it's a bit early in the year, but I am going to add a new category [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=433.34s)]
*  We're proposing a new category. We'll love to hear your feedback on it for the 2024 besties [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=437.56s)]
*  most based CEO [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=443.08s)]
*  Lots of options to choose from right now, which we'll get into in a minute [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=445.24s)]
*  But there seems to be a bit of a vibe shift happening intact during peak zurp and cancel culture [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=448.8s)]
*  2019 to 2021 [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  era [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=456.32s)]
*  Seemed like CEOs were a little vigilant about what they would say, you know [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=457.48s)]
*  The Tim Cooks to Sundars, but something has clearly changed tech CEOs have gotten radically candid and fired their comms group [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=461.72s)]
*  Two great examples this week that we were talking about [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=468.56s)]
*  Jensen Wong the CEO of Nvidia had this awesome clip and speaking at Stanford's Graduate School of Business [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=472.12s)]
*  I think one of my great advantages is that I have very low expectations and I mean that most of the Stanford [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=478.28s)]
*  graduates have very high expectations people with very high expectations have very low resilience and [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=485.0s)]
*  Unfortunately resilience matters in success. I don't know how to teach it to you except for I hope suffering happens to you to this day [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=491.47999999999996s)]
*  I use the word the phrase pain and suffering inside our company with great glee boy [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  This is gonna cause a lot of pain and suffering and I mean that in a happy way [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=502.44s)]
*  Because you want to train you want to refine the character of your company you want greatness out of them and greatness is not intelligence [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=505.52s)]
*  It's greatness comes from character and character is informed out of smart people [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  It's formed out of people who suffered and then next up Palantir CEO Alex Karp called out the coked up short sellers [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=515.72s)]
*  See I love burning the short sellers like almost nothing makes a human happier than taking the glides of cocaine and [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=525.3199999999999s)]
*  Away from these short sellers who like are going short on a truly great American company [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=533.52s)]
*  Not just ours, but it just loved pulling down great American companies so that they can pay for their coke [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=539.36s)]
*  And the best thing that could happen to them is we will provide we will lead their coke dealers to their homes after they can't pay [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=544.24s)]
*  their bills [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=551.52s)]
*  Surely all short sellers. Yeah. Well, you know go ahead and do your thing. We'll do our thing. Hey have it folks, of course [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=553.88s)]
*  We had [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=560.7800000000001s)]
*  Elon's great [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=563.98s)]
*  Good for you at [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=566.46s)]
*  Some New York Times conference always candid and even Zuckerberg. He's been getting a little based [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=568.7800000000001s)]
*  He did a whole video about how the Apple vision Pro was when compared to Metisquest 2 [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=574.34s)]
*  He's got a little frisky on the social media [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=581.0200000000001s)]
*  Freeburg [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=584.5400000000001s)]
*  Is the vibe shift real? It seems like a lot of people are less worried about the fact that [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=585.86s)]
*  Cancel culture as they were three years ago [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=591.0600000000001s)]
*  so I don't know if it's just in Silicon Valley broadly in media and [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=594.74s)]
*  Broadly culturally there seems to be a move away from cancel culture mentality and people are speaking their mind [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=599.86s)]
*  Which is yeah, I think obviously positive and refreshing [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=607.9000000000001s)]
*  Saks you're a big fan of [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=612.22s)]
*  freedom of speech your thoughts on this [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=614.5s)]
*  Vibe shit is it is this related to cancel culture kind of ending and journalists just not being able [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=617.2199999999999s)]
*  To cancel people because they misspoke or were a little spicy in their takes [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=623.1s)]
*  Well, I like the fact that these CEOs are all being [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=628.1s)]
*  Colorful in their remarks and candid and interesting and that that's always a good thing [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=631.98s)]
*  In each of these cases, I kind of like what they had to say [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=637.18s)]
*  But I think that you might or we collectively might be reading a little bit too much into this [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=641.1s)]
*  I [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=646.6999999999999s)]
*  Mean at the end of the day what secret cows are they really challenging what real? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=647.62s)]
*  Dangerous truths are they speaking? What real risks are they taking? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=653.9s)]
*  I just don't put any of the things that they're saying or doing in the same category [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=656.88s)]
*  as say what Elon has been doing in terms of taking on the powers that be in terms of rolling back censorship and [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=661.9s)]
*  Promoting free speech on on X. I mean Elon I think has taken some real risks in doing that [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=669.9s)]
*  And you see that he's paying the price with all these government investigations and the voiding of his compensation package [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=676.3s)]
*  That I think is just in a slightly different category of true [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=683.8599999999999s)]
*  risk-taking by speaking truth to power or allowing the masses to speak truth to power [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=688.5799999999999s)]
*  Compared to what these other guys are doing and I'm not disparaging any of them [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=694.78s)]
*  But you know look at them one by one. I mean Alex Karp made a colorful joke at the expense of short traders. I [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=698.0799999999999s)]
*  Agree, but it's not really a risky remark [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=704.58s)]
*  Jensen Wang is giving some tough love to Stanford students [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=708.0200000000001s)]
*  He's giving them I think a good lesson of stopping so entitled go get some real-life experience [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=712.46s)]
*  Be resilient. Okay, great message. I saw the Zuckerberg clip liked it as well. He's basically [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=719.5400000000001s)]
*  Speaking from a place of passion about his own product and comparing it to Apple. Okay, great. That's what he's supposed to do [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=726.0600000000001s)]
*  I don't see any of those CEOs take again if you want to compare it to Elon [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=732.28s)]
*  Taking a really dangerous political stance. In fact, remember when Zuckerberg got dragged to Capitol Hill and gave that testimony [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=737.36s)]
*  And they demanded that he give that apology. He did it. I mean, you know, I thought that word was banned on this [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=744.8s)]
*  Anybody else could be dead you like I mean I thought he was just showing some humanity [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=756.24s)]
*  Which is you know kind of paradoxical look I get it in that moment [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=760.92s)]
*  But I'm just saying that like if you want to put it in the same category as Elon the thing to do would have been [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=764.36s)]
*  To punch back and I think in that moment [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=769.3199999999999s)]
*  It was who it was Josh Hawley the thing to do would have been to say no [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=772.04s)]
*  It's it's you who are exploiting the misery and suffering of all these people by trying to score political points. So anyway [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=775.0s)]
*  I don't know. It's super best. Yeah. Yeah, that would have been super base [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=782.5999999999999s)]
*  so all I'm saying is that it's one thing for [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=785.36s)]
*  These founders and CEOs to be colorful and candid or whatever. That's all great [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=788.6400000000001s)]
*  But have they really taken political courage your thoughts chamoff on based CEOs? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=794.5600000000001s)]
*  well, I think Jason the [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=801.76s)]
*  The takeaway I think you're almost on the right point, but not quite. I don't think this is based or not based [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=803.76s)]
*  I think the point is everybody is exhausted with the multiple layers of [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=809.6800000000001s)]
*  word [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=815.96s)]
*  Grambled gymnastics that people have had to play and they're like enough's enough [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=817.32s)]
*  I think the more interesting way to look at this is that there was a few year period [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=821.88s)]
*  where a lot of companies were under a lot of pressure and [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=828.36s)]
*  Folks felt that they couldn't say what was on their minds to really fix the problems that they saw [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=832.5200000000001s)]
*  Now you have you know [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=838.84s)]
*  both of the companies and the CEOs you pointed out are firing on all cylinders as far as anybody can tell from the [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=840.36s)]
*  Outside and there's a certain level of political capital that comes with that and they're choosing to spend it [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=845.84s)]
*  And I think that's the interesting takeaway, which is as these companies become [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=851.62s)]
*  Successful again as tech reemerges again from this multi-year malaise are folks going to [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=856.6800000000001s)]
*  Find their voice or not [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=864.0400000000001s)]
*  And I think that's the big point which is that it seems at least that we can see this next generation of winning companies [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=866.44s)]
*  Seems to have CEOs that will [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=873.76s)]
*  Take a different path. They'll be maybe closer to an Elon then closer to a politician. Yeah, it's I loved [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=876.76s)]
*  Long's comments just about his secret weapon is he has incredibly low expectations [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=884.2s)]
*  If you had said if you had said that comment a few years ago [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=889.08s)]
*  The whole pain and suffering thing would somebody would have said I felt triggered it touched my childhood trauma [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=892.64s)]
*  You know I had X Y & Z happened to me and it's not that those people don't have valid claims [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=898.76s)]
*  But they would have aired it in a way that tried to [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=904.48s)]
*  Get him cancelled effectively. Yeah, he would be out of touch [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=907.96s)]
*  He would be talking down to people to be a billionaire telling people like to suck it up [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=911.12s)]
*  What does he know in fairness? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=915.88s)]
*  I bet you there are people that felt that way even today when listening to his clip the thing that is different though [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=917.64s)]
*  Was the rest of us who also have had pain and suffering in our lives [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=923.16s)]
*  Retweeted it and was just like this is a hundred percent. Awesome. Yeah, I mean finally candid advice [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=927.34s)]
*  Elon used to always say happiness equals this was his happiness formula happiness equals [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=935.26s)]
*  Expectation reality minus expectations and so [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=943.86s)]
*  If your expectations are really high and reality doesn't hit it [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=947.7800000000001s)]
*  You're gonna be sad and if you keep your expectations low and realities, you know, okay or good [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=950.58s)]
*  Yeah, you could be happy in life, but Freiburg I just love of those quotes [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=954.66s)]
*  Maybe some thoughts about suffering and how hard it is. You're back in the CEO seat [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=961.06s)]
*  How's that been going for you? Generally speaking? How hard is it compared to being a capital allocator? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=967.42s)]
*  Curious I was gonna talk to you about that offline. Anyway, I probably have an unhealthy [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=973.02s)]
*  affinity for suffering I think that [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=979.5s)]
*  If you come from [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=983.6999999999999s)]
*  Certain [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=987.5799999999999s)]
*  Backgrounds you're sort of trained that that's the place [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=989.06s)]
*  that your [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=992.66s)]
*  unconscious tends to want to be [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=994.5s)]
*  And I think that that also some people call it chips on shoulders [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=996.54s)]
*  Some people call it motivation. I mean look at your friend Elon [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1001.9799999999999s)]
*  How much suffering he puts his himself through I? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1006.3399999999999s)]
*  Think it's a requisite to [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1010.14s)]
*  Greatness is you have to really find ways to sacrifice now if I've said this a lot [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1012.66s)]
*  There's a reason a lot of people that have had success in their career [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1018.06s)]
*  Don't end up being great entrepreneurs [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1021.5799999999999s)]
*  Because as soon as you're faced with failure for the first time it doesn't pattern match to what's happened to you historically [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1023.9799999999999s)]
*  I go to a good school. I get good grades. I go to Stanford. I get a degree [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1030.3799999999999s)]
*  Everything about every step you do you're told if you do X you will get Y [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1035.1799999999998s)]
*  Then you do X and you get Y and you repeat and at some point you're considered successful [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1039.18s)]
*  In your education in your career and so on if you then decide that entrepreneurship is the path for you [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1044.42s)]
*  You realize that entrepreneurship is that there is no if X then Y [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1050.74s)]
*  There is if X maybe Y maybe Z [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1055.14s)]
*  Maybe a hundred other things that will smack you in the face and that experience is shockingly different for people that have historically followed a path [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1058.74s)]
*  Of success of what's defined as success culturally socially and I think that that's really what he's speaking to [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1066.1s)]
*  If you've grown up where all of your expectations have not been met or many of the expectations have not been met [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1071.82s)]
*  You realize that persistence grit perseverance relentlessness [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1077.1399999999999s)]
*  These are the necessary traits to be successful in entrepreneurship [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1081.26s)]
*  And I think that I find myself much happier in that condition than in any other condition [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1084.6999999999998s)]
*  And it's why I'm actually very happy in the work. I'm doing right now [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1089.98s)]
*  yeah, I I [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1093.1s)]
*  Think that resonates a lot with me and all the entrepreneurs that I back they all have that chip and [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1095.1s)]
*  You got to be careful not to get caught up in the trappings and really focus on solving problems [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1101.86s)]
*  If you think about what a CEO does all day you hire the smartest team, you know [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1106.2199999999998s)]

*  The smartest people you could find to join your team can't fix so then your life becomes [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1117.2199999999998s)]

*  There's only a certain percentage of people who can do that day in and day out just relentlessly be faced reconcile [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1128.06s)]
*  How do you reconcile that statement Jason with? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1135.5s)]
*  the [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1139.18s)]
*  Proposition that people should become entrepreneurs generally I think that this really [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1140.38s)]
*  This really challenges me whenever people say I'm thinking about starting a company [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1145.46s)]
*  My first response is no don't like you have to be told over and over again [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1149.3s)]
*  To not start a company to test if they actually have the resilience and grit necessary just to take the first step of starting [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1154.3s)]
*  The company I have gotten that everyone should be encouraged to start a company and entrepreneurism is a is a career choice [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1160.32s)]
*  I think is a false notion. I think that most people are not psychologically equipped for being successful in entrepreneurship [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1166.3s)]
*  Yeah, you're 100% right and I've gotten in my later years as we run like founding university of these programs [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1173.18s)]
*  When people are applying and we only accept 10% into the programs and then only invest in [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1178.82s)]
*  10% of those so net net like less than 1% get funded [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1183.74s)]
*  You know, I'll ask them they're like, oh, can you give us money so I can get a co-founder? [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1187.3s)]
*  And I'm like, you know what you failed the first test of being an entrepreneur [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1192.62s)]
*  You know [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1196.54s)]
*  The first test of being an entrepreneur is can you convince two or three people to go on this crazy journey with you? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1197.1s)]
*  Because it's important and without money and you know people expect [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1201.86s)]
*  Oh, you're gonna just give them the money because they have an interesting idea and then I asked them what's your skill? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1206.1s)]
*  What do you do at the start? Do you sell the product? Do you build the product and a lot of people do not have the [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1210.1799999999998s)]
*  Wherewithal to add a skill that the world needs being a developer a UX designer a salesperson [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1216.54s)]
*  Whatever it is, right? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1223.3s)]
*  They don't have any skill and then they also have no ability to convince somebody else with skills to start a company [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1224.3799999999999s)]
*  If you can't have marketable important skills yourself that you taught yourself on your own [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1231.96s)]
*  Through sheer force of motivation and will and opening up YouTube which really isn't that hard people? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1239.6399999999999s)]
*  Like anybody can learn to code to be a UX designer to be a salesperson all this is on [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1245.24s)]
*  Some online course some book some YouTube video some podcast [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1250.9199999999998s)]
*  So just learn some marketable skills that a startup needs and if you can't do that, you shouldn't be a founder [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1254.6399999999999s)]
*  I think the point is that [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1260.08s)]
*  Everybody's capable of being a founder and anybody can and should start a company. It's just that very few can finish a company and [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1262.48s)]
*  that is the resilience part where [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1269.52s)]
*  there's just so many ups and downs and you have to be able to roll and survive and [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1272.1599999999999s)]
*  You have to just problem-solve constantly and yeah [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1277.9199999999998s)]
*  There are very few people that are cut out for it. You have to be comfortable with failure [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1280.8799999999999s)]
*  You have to be comfortable with expectations not being met. That's the important point that he's making [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1284.8799999999999s)]
*  I can't tell you how important it was early in my career [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1289.5s)]
*  I had several cold-calling jobs where I called called college kids. I called called alumni. I called called CEOs [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1292.54s)]
*  I had three different cold-calling jobs and [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1298.54s)]
*  Getting rejection after rejection failing in my life. I didn't get into any schools except for Berkeley [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1301.3s)]
*  Because Berkeley didn't take teacher recommendations to be teachers [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1306.74s)]
*  I did not do well in school and then playing poker taught me a lot [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1310.1s)]
*  Because playing poker you you lose hands you lose hands you lose hands you lose hands [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1313.42s)]
*  You have to just make sure that you're making the right decisions and over time the money will come to you the positive EV will [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1317.42s)]
*  Be there but failure and persisting through failure. I think was one of the most important [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1322.1000000000001s)]
*  Traits I had to develop before I was even ready to start a company because all that's happening every day is failure [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1326.8200000000002s)]
*  But I had my first magazine [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1332.72s)]
*  I didn't understand I had just printed photocopies up and I had like 2,000 copies of this magazine [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1334.0600000000002s)]
*  Silicon Island reporter and I didn't know how to get them in people's hands. So I just got a luggage cart [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1339.0200000000002s)]
*  Like a little luggage cart, I put them in the luggage cart and I walked around lower Manhattan and I just [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1345.18s)]
*  Dropped them off at internet companies and I dropped them off at cafes [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1351.3799999999999s)]
*  And then I went to all the village voice boxes and I just slotted them in in between the village voice and [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1354.86s)]
*  Miraculously people found it and then they would subscribe and you know, whatever it took was the approach [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1361.02s)]
*  Alright everybody, let's get to our second topic a mini topic [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1366.82s)]
*  But did opening I just get caught with their hand in the cookie jar or the training data cookie jar [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1370.58s)]
*  Open AI CTO was interviewed by the Wall Street Journal this week during the interview [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1376.46s)]
*  You probably saw this if you're on X it trended [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1381.3s)]
*  She was asked what data did opening I use to train Sora if you don't know what Sora is we talked about it here [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1383.34s)]
*  It's that incredible [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1388.1799999999998s)]
*  You know video create, you know type in a text prompt get a video back [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1390.46s)]
*  Model and let's watch this clip and then discuss it what data was used to train Sora [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1394.5s)]
*  We used publicly available data and licensed data [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1401.0200000000002s)]
*  so [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1406.0200000000002s)]
*  videos on YouTube [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1407.0600000000002s)]
*  I'm actually not sure about that. Okay videos from [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1410.9s)]
*  Facebook Instagram [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1415.5400000000002s)]
*  You know if they were publicly available [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1418.3400000000001s)]
*  Available available yet publicly available to use [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1421.6200000000001s)]
*  there might be [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1426.5s)]
*  The data but I'm not sure I'm not confident about it. Let me start with you Chima. What are your thoughts here and [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1428.02s)]
*  Just her not being super prepared there to answer a question or is this a cookie jar situation? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1436.18s)]
*  What do you think? I mean you got to think the CTO of an organization that [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1442.06s)]
*  Whose job it is to build models based on training data knows where the training data is from [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1446.5800000000002s)]
*  My interpretation of that answer is that she is hesitating because she doesn't want to make a statement against interest [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1451.9s)]
*  Right. I want to show you guys something. I had a friend of mine [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1459.2600000000002s)]
*  somebody we all know [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1463.3000000000002s)]
*  who's [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1465.3000000000002s)]
*  Deep in the heart of this AI stuff [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1466.7s)]
*  He was he came to my office and he showed me this one really interesting thing, which is when you [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1469.74s)]
*  Launch chat GPT and if you go into the microphone [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1474.66s)]
*  But you say nothing so you just wait a few seconds turn on the microphone wait a few seconds and turn it off [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1478.74s)]
*  I'll just do it right now just to show you it comes back and it says thank you for watching [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1483.3000000000002s)]
*  Which is typically what it shows you [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1487.38s)]
*  When you ought to watch a bunch of YouTube videos [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1490.74s)]
*  Now why is that interesting? Well if you say nothing [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1494.5s)]
*  Right. The model has clearly then is guessing that whenever you watch a video [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1499.1000000000001s)]
*  It's probably the next best thing to translate that into is thank you for watching [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1503.42s)]
*  Which would mean that the training happened on a bunch of content where thank you for watching was the next obvious thing so that when there's [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1507.5400000000002s)]
*  Silence and the most obvious place where that happens is in YouTube. I don't know [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1515.7800000000002s)]
*  I thought that was an interesting little thing that he pointed out to me. I don't know if anybody's actually explored this but [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1519.9s)]
*  If it is true and Google decides they have an issue with it, that's not true [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1525.5400000000002s)]
*  I think it's fine. I don't know why this is a controversial thing [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1528.9s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's obvious she's kind of lying on camera [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1533.02s)]
*  She definitely knows where the training data came from and it feels like see see why I mean, I mean what YouTube is public [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1536.42s)]
*  So what's wrong with watching YouTube to teach a model? [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1543.02s)]
*  Well, you'd have to get a license to make a derivative work as we've seen in YouTube [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1547.3400000000001s)]
*  So I think it's a good thing that YouTube is public. I mean, it's a good thing that YouTube is public [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1551.02s)]
*  Well, you'd have to get a license to make a derivative work as we've seen open AI has been doing that [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1555.22s)]
*  They're in a lawsuit right now with the New York Times and they failed to negotiate their license [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1560.3600000000001s)]
*  So I think the assumption is they're making a derivative work [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1565.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean they've licensed other people's data, right? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1568.46s)]
*  Yet to get access to it. That's not publicly available. You can go to YouTube downloader and download all this data [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1572.66s)]
*  You know, it's crazy [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1577.42s)]
*  I heard from someone at Google that under the terms of service Google's not allowed to trade on YouTube data [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1578.42s)]
*  Remember my I made this point a couple weeks ago about how important YouTube data is [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1584.1s)]
*  I think there would be this really ironic handicap that Google's done to itself [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1587.66s)]
*  Where anyone else can access and download and watch YouTube data to train models, but Google cannot [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1592.18s)]
*  I don't know if there's any clarity on that, but it's a pretty crazy fact pattern [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1597.7s)]
*  But yeah, YouTube's on the internet and I feel like anything that's on the open internet should be watchable by these models [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1601.42s)]
*  I don't consider training models to be generation of derivative work. That's my decision [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1606.38s)]
*  And that's a position that opening eyes taking the other side of that position because they're going around licensing data sacks [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1611.1599999999999s)]
*  Any other thoughts here about this crefluffle? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1617.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, look I kind of agree with both you and freeburg in terms of the part that I agree with freeburg [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1619.72s)]
*  I think that this issue is kind of more of the same of what we've been talking about for a while [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1624.9599999999998s)]
*  Which is clearly open AI trained its model on publicly available data that was available on the on the internet [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1629.22s)]
*  I agree with freeburg that [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1635.6799999999998s)]
*  Fair use doctrine should be applied to that. I know that you have a different point of view on that Jake [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1638.2s)]
*  I don't know if we need to rehash that I understand that you don't think fair use should apply in any event. I [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1642.32s)]
*  think it's pretty clear that [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1648.76s)]
*  Open AI train sorry using you know available data on the internet and that probably included [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1651.08s)]
*  YouTube the part where I agree with you jcal is that I don't know if I would [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1657.1599999999999s)]
*  Say that she's lying per se but I think she's probably concerned [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1662.44s)]
*  That if she comes right out and answers the question as directly as she could [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1667.6399999999999s)]
*  That it could be a problem for them in all these lawsuits that they're now facing, you know again, I think that I [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1673.6799999999998s)]
*  Would take the side in those lawsuits that fair use should be allowed [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1679.6399999999999s)]
*  But I think that probably she is being careful here because they are facing so many lawsuits about this training data [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1682.56s)]
*  It's gonna be pretty clear to him off [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1689.6799999999998s)]
*  I think what the courts will decide here [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1692.28s)]
*  Which is whose opportunity is it to make a Sora in the world if Disney owns a massive collection of IP and [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1694.28s)]
*  Somebody should be able to use that IP to make derivative works [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1701.44s)]
*  Should it be Sora or should it be Disney itself? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1704.68s)]
*  And so I think the journalists know full well what they're doing [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1707.68s)]
*  And now the journalists have their hooks into this for a very real reason the journalists are also content creators [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1712.68s)]
*  You know two sides forming [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1719.9199999999998s)]
*  Journalists worry that these folks are not technical enough to make this decision and you know when it goes into a court [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1721.9199999999998s)]
*  How is a judge really gonna understand the nuances of this to make it to make a call or the jury? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1728.52s)]
*  It's gonna be a big education process. Yeah. Yeah or the jury. Yeah [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1734.6799999999998s)]
*  Speaking of AI vertical AI startups are starting to make some noise [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1738.52s)]
*  We all know about large language models. We've talked about them here. If you listen to this program, you know about opening I Google's [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1742.6799999999998s)]
*  Gemini previously known as Bard and proper Claude all this stuff their general purpose [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1749.08s)]
*  They've been trained on the open internet as we were just discussing so they can answer questions about almost anything [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1754.12s)]
*  And yeah, sometimes it's correct. Sometimes they're incorrect, but it's showing promise [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1760.6799999999998s)]
*  There is another school of thought here that's emerging in startups vertical AI [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1765.26s)]
*  these companies are kind of taking a job title a [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1770.36s)]
*  Role in society and they are building vertical apps Harvey is AI for lawyers [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1773.96s)]
*  A bridge is doing an AI note taker for doctors saves them hours a day according to them [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1779.8s)]
*  Tax GPT is an AI tax assistant and Sierra's AI for customer support. That's Brett Taylor's new startup this week a [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1786.6399999999999s)]
*  Startup called cognition debuted a tool called Devin [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1794.32s)]
*  They're calling it an AI software engineer the demos went viral on X [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1797.2s)]
*  You've probably seen them all over the place and in the news if you watch it [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1800.5600000000002s)]
*  You can see Devin fixing bugs in real time fine-tuning an AI model building apps and and and people are speculating [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1804.2s)]
*  Devin was built on GPT for from open AI. That's not confirmed [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1811.6000000000001s)]
*  But according to the CEO Devin was built by tweaking reasoning and long-term planning into an existing LLM [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1816.72s)]
*  Here's how it ranks against other major models on coding benchmarks [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1823.88s)]
*  They're building all these benchmarks to test each language model and as you can see it's [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1828.42s)]
*  According to this chart and according to their data doing much better than just a generic language model [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1833.5s)]
*  It kind of makes sense schmaltz. Did you see these demos this week? I think I saw you on the group chat talking about it [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1840.3000000000002s)]
*  And what was your take on? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1845.9s)]
*  These role-based vertical startups. Oh, I think this is so powerful. I mean [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1848.3000000000002s)]
*  It's incredible because we're measuring this progress in like what week over week [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1853.94s)]
*  feels like that, yeah, I [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1858.5s)]
*  think the point that you should take away is that the [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1860.78s)]
*  Most of these very difficult in [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1865.42s)]
*  impenetrable job types [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1869.6200000000001s)]
*  For the average person if you said to them, hey become a developer. That's like a complicated journey, right? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1871.38s)]
*  It's just gonna be now like [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1878.9s)]
*  A [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1881.9s)]
*  command line interface where you just kind of describe in English what you want to do and [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1883.18s)]
*  All of this stuff will just happen behind the scenes and it'll be totally automated. So that'll grow [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1887.5s)]
*  the number of people that [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1892.74s)]
*  Can use these tools at the same time. It'll make the developers I think even more [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1895.7s)]
*  valued because you're gonna need people in the guts of these models and [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1901.18s)]
*  In the code that it generates because it's not always gonna work perfectly [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1904.98s)]
*  There's always gonna be some kind of hallucination some stuff is not gonna compile now the demos that they did though were incredible [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1908.5s)]
*  They were able to find errors. They were able to remediate errors in code. I [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1914.62s)]
*  Mean, I just I think it's really really special. So you you've been on [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1918.82s)]
*  Copilots for the past year talking about that. This is slightly different. We're moving from hey, here's a copilot somebody helping a developer [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1924.14s)]
*  To hey, here's a developer working and now they have a supervisor [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1931.42s)]
*  So, what do you think of these sort of role-based agents and how quickly we went from year one? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1936.02s)]
*  Copiloting to okay now they're the pilot and we're sitting in the copilot seat watching them fly the plane [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1942.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, well look first of all everyone's working on autonomous coding or working towards that [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1948.7s)]
*  This is like one of the core most obvious use cases of LLMs because code is text and it can also be run through a [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1953.54s)]
*  Compiler to debug it so you can also get to in theory you can get to high levels of accuracy yet [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1961.64s)]
*  Although in the example that you gave Jason this new product was only at 13% [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1967.16s)]
*  So there's still a long way to go, but the potential is clearly there [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1972.2s)]
*  So a lot of companies are working on some variation of this idea [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1976.16s)]
*  Devon is I guess you call it an agent first approach and I think that's very cool for generating new [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1983.1000000000001s)]
*  Software projects but where I think this gets much trickier and is much more difficult [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1991.12s)]
*  Is when you're working in existing code bases and just to talk my own book for a second [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=1996.1999999999998s)]
*  We're an investor in a company called source graph [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2001.8s)]
*  They have a product called Cody and their whole approach is context first as opposed to agent first [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2003.6799999999998s)]
*  It's all about getting the copilot to work inside of existing code bases [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2008.4799999999998s)]
*  So different companies are coming at this from different approaches get up copilot [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2013.2199999999998s)]
*  I think is kind of more like Cody where it's all about making an existing code base [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2016.88s)]
*  More useful whereas Devon again is starting with I think net new code bases, but that's gonna demo really well [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2022.4s)]
*  And so that's what you're seeing is like these really cool demos in any event the larger picture here [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2028.88s)]
*  Is that we are gonna get better at better at? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2033.88s)]
*  coding [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2037.64s)]
*  Autonomously, I guess you could say and I don't know if it gets ever gets to a hundred percent where you don't need coders anymore [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2039.0400000000002s)]
*  But it's gonna make coders much more productive over time you're gonna get this huge [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2044.2s)]
*  Multiplier effect on the ability to write code and that's really exciting for a bunch of obvious reasons [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2049.92s)]
*  Freiburg we've been tracking this evolution from you know [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2056.12s)]
*  Gmail guess the next word test the next phrase guess the next sentence to co-pilots now [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2060.0s)]
*  We have these role-based agent base [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2066.16s)]
*  Solutions that startups are pursuing [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2070.56s)]
*  What's next if we follow this thread what would the next evolution here be? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2072.96s)]
*  well, the big push has been for this notion of a GI to replace a human and [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2078.52s)]
*  I think what we're seeing is [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2083.7999999999997s)]
*  Software that [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2088.32s)]
*  replaces a specific [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2090.7599999999998s)]
*  Human doing a specific thing like being a lawyer being an accountant [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2093.14s)]
*  Being an art director if you think about the internet when the internet [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2098.08s)]
*  Which was like networking software and the capabilities that arose from the connection of all these computers [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2102.56s)]
*  During the internet era the innovation was everyone tried to create a business model [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2107.72s)]
*  Which was how do you take an existing vertical business and put it on the internet? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2112.16s)]
*  I think what we're seeing in this era is everyone's taking a vertical human and creating a vertical version of a human [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2116.08s)]
*  in the AI era and [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2123.2s)]
*  So I think like the the success will probably accrue to one [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2125.3599999999997s)]
*  Company that replaces one set of core human services like being a lawyer being an accountant [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2132.08s)]
*  you know being an artist in whatever way and [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2138.16s)]
*  That that ends up being [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2141.68s)]
*  the specific vertical tool that people will use [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2143.9199999999996s)]
*  To automate and scale up their ability to do that task in an automated way because I think that there's like a great deal of [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2147.7599999999998s)]
*  Capability that emerges in the fine-tuning and the unique data that certain people may have to make that one tool better than the rest and [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2156.12s)]
*  Therefore everyone will end up using this one lawyer service [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2163.12s)]
*  Or this one accounting service or what have you so I definitely think that's kind of what we're seeing [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2166.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious where this is going. You got co-pilots assisting a developer or a lawyer [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2170.56s)]
*  Then the next or writer then they got the next phase. Okay, you've got a peer [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2177.12s)]
*  So you're doing peer programming or somebody's kind of working alongside you you're checking their work [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2181.48s)]
*  Hey, maybe they're even checking your work seeing if you have bugs [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2185.56s)]
*  Where this is gonna be next year is there's gonna be a conductor [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2188.64s)]
*  There's gonna be somebody who has a role or a piece of software has a role where you say [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2191.2s)]
*  Hey, you're a CEO of a company. You're a founder a product manager. Here's your lawyer. Here's your accountant. Here's your developers [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2196.66s)]
*  Here's your designer and now you will coordinate those five people now [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2203.48s)]
*  Imagine how that changes startups when you as an individual have a [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2208.32s)]
*  Conductor working with you and says you know what? I don't know if I agree with this legal advice [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2212.88s)]
*  That's coming in in relation to the tax advice and maybe we should not even add this feature to the program [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2216.86s)]
*  Let's talk to the product manager the agent product manager about taking that feature out [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2222.94s)]
*  So we don't have these downstream legal issues and we don't even have to file taxes in this area [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2227.28s)]
*  It's gonna get really interesting next year when they have a conductor [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2231.96s)]
*  The other way it may go Jason is you have a lawyer that has 50 associates working for them through the AI [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2235.04s)]
*  So you don't replace the lawyer [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2242.36s)]
*  You don't replace the software engineer the software engineer levels up and now the software engineer has 50 engineers available 50 agents running [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2244.28s)]
*  Doing tasks for them turn your do still you do still need humans with domain expertise and creativity to think through architecture to think through [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2251.6800000000003s)]
*  Process and to make sure that the AI agents are doing their job [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2260.08s)]
*  So I think what it creates is extraordinary leverage for people and organizations [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2263.68s)]
*  Which is why generally economic productivity goes up people don't lose jobs [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2267.6s)]
*  They level up in this phase the the OPEC's of companies will probably be cut in half [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2271.24s)]
*  At the limit I think Jason is actually [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2278.08s)]
*  Absolutely, right [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2281.8399999999997s)]
*  I think you find that there'll be millions of companies with one person and then a whole layer of software and conductors and agents and bots [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2282.52s)]
*  That's the future. Yeah, so you won't have these engineering people that person should be running their own company [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2290.0s)]
*  And so you'll just have millions and millions and millions and maybe billions of companies and I think that that's really [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2295.96s)]
*  exciting not all of them will work many of them will fail and a few of them will be ginormous and [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2302.36s)]
*  It'll be up to the person who can [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2307.96s)]
*  Navigate and be a conductor as you said, you know [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2310.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's gonna be really interesting the solo entrepreneur movement of last couple years [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2312.96s)]
*  There were all these kind of like independent hackers building one item like Phil Kaplan did with [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2317.4s)]
*  Distro kid he said like two or three people working on that got very big, you know [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2323.1200000000003s)]
*  I was telling you guys about that slopes app. I showed you I reached out to the founder of that [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2327.1600000000003s)]
*  I was like, hey tell me about the business like it's enough of a business to support one person or two people like there [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2331.56s)]
*  Will be a lot of these apps or services one conductor and [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2336.28s)]
*  Yeah, it makes what half million a year three million a year whatever [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2340.44s)]
*  It's enough to support one two three people working on it [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2343.24s)]
*  But previously, you know you'd be going to the venture community like oh, what did it take a modern app company? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2346.12s)]
*  Sax to kind of build an Android in a an iOS app just you know [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2352.04s)]
*  Five ten years ago if we were funding one ten years ago, what would the footprint look like? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2357.8799999999997s)]
*  For you know a consumer app company if you're gonna go all the way back to like the late 90s during the dot-com era [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2363.6s)]
*  I remember that [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2370.16s)]
*  With PayPal just to launch [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2371.88s)]
*  Really? What was an MVP we had I'd say a dozen developers and it was pretty expensive and we had to set up our own colo [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2374.76s)]
*  There was all this infrastructure that all got distracted away with AWS. Then you move to the mobile era and the app stores provide [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2382.1600000000003s)]
*  There's just a lot more developer tools more APIs. Yeah, it was well as distribution, but it's far easier to code these apps [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2391.2000000000003s)]
*  So definitely things have gotten easier and easier that's the trend if that's the point you're trying to make it's certainly [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2397.92s)]
*  Never been easier to get started in creating something if you're a solo developer [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2404.08s)]
*  Yeah, that being said I think that depending on what you're trying to do [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2409.12s)]
*  It's still usually the case that if you're trying to do something interesting and profound [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2413.4s)]
*  You're gonna need a small team of developers and a couple million bucks to get you started [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2419.04s)]
*  Yeah, it used to be rule of thumb I think 12 people for an app company get two or three working on each platform couple designers [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2424.36s)]
*  couple testing and [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2430.52s)]
*  Design UX you get to 10 12 people to run a modern one. Alright everybody next issue [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2433.76s)]
*  the house just passed a [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2440.44s)]
*  Bill that would either ban tick-tock or force a sale talked about this bill being proposed last week and things had [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2442.84s)]
*  Moved really slowly on the tick-tock ban now [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2450.2s)]
*  They're moving really fast on Wednesday the house passed the bill with a bipartisan vote of 352 [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2453.08s)]
*  265 making this one of the few subjects that members of Congress can agree on [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2458.8399999999997s)]
*  Biden has also signaled his intent to sign the bill into law should it pass the Senate passing the Senate that could be an obstacle [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2463.7599999999998s)]
*  Democratic jury leader Chuck Schumer [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2469.72s)]
*  Has signaled a lack of interest in the subject and said he'll review the bill with committee chairs before deciding on the path forward [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2471.8799999999997s)]
*  Arguments for and against the bill have centered around a few main points reciprocity. We talked about that here [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2477.7999999999997s)]
*  you can't use Instagram acts or any of our [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2483.64s)]
*  Domestic social networks in China and if they won't allow us in their country [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2486.72s)]
*  Why should we give them unrestricted access to ours stifling debate? [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2491.0s)]
*  Progressives fear this isn't really about national security [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2494.64s)]
*  their position is [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2498.72s)]
*  Mainstream politicians are hoping to shut down political discourse [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2500.72s)]
*  Particularly among the youth who are mostly on tik-tok [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2504.4s)]
*  particularly pro-palestinian and anti-israel discourse which [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2508.24s)]
*  Seems to flourish on tik-tok versus other platforms coincidentally [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2512.4s)]
*  Joe Biden launched a tik-tok account last month and his comments were instantly flooded with pro-palestinian [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2516.72s)]
*  remarks some calling him genocide Joe [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2523.64s)]
*  Third argument over each some sex [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2527.92s)]
*  I think you've pointed out that the language in this law is a bit vague. It needs to be tightened up [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2531.1s)]
*  Maybe the president could go after companies supposedly aligned with foreign interests who aren't our esteemed [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2536.58s)]
*  Patriot and friend Keith Raboi argued with you sacks on this on X [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2543.1s)]
*  And then there are guys like Trump in Vivek who I believe are flip-flopping based on securing bags Vivek called [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2547.54s)]
*  Tik-tok digital fentanyl and [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2554.62s)]
*  Trump issued an executive order calling for bite dance to divest tik-tok in 2020 now. They're both opposing the ban and [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2556.7s)]
*  Interestingly both Trump and Vivek have ties to the Republican megadona Jeffrey. Yes [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2565.1s)]
*  Who is a major shareholder in bite dance with a reported 15 to 30 billion dollar stake? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2570.98s)]
*  He gave Vivek five million bucks who knows what Trump's gotten [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2577.14s)]
*  But they said they're back in love sacks you had this big back-and-forth with Keith Raboi on X [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2582.02s)]
*  Are you in support of the divestiture or not? I haven't been able to track exactly where you're out of this [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2588.42s)]
*  Well, I think my take on this and I'm gonna have to revise and extend my remarks from last week because I didn't know as [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2596.14s)]
*  Much about the bill. I hadn't actually read the language yet [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2602.02s)]
*  And now I have and my take on this is that the bill poses a significant risk of being [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2604.74s)]
*  Patriot Act 2.0. So in other words [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2611.54s)]
*  You know a threat to the security of the United States is basically hyped up some part of it may be real [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2615.06s)]
*  Some of it may be threat inflation and then we give the intelligence community and the government new powers [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2621.1s)]
*  Which can then be abused and that's exactly what happened with the Patriot Act. They ended up spying on Americans now [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2627.38s)]
*  What is the potential abuse here? This is the thing that I've debated with Keith [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2633.3s)]
*  And there's also other people who I respect a lot and Keith by the way is a very talented lawyer in addition to other things [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2638.54s)]
*  being a successful [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2645.54s)]
*  founder and [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2647.3799999999997s)]
*  investor an [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2649.22s)]
*  Investor and then you know, I saw that cigar and Jenny whose show I was just on thinks that the bill is just fine [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2650.3799999999997s)]
*  So look there are people very legit people who disagree with me about this [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2656.3399999999997s)]
*  But I went last night and I read this bill like four times to try and like parse the language [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2661.2599999999998s)]
*  And I've just come away concluding there's no [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2666.2599999999998s)]
*  The way I see it [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2669.7799999999997s)]
*  There's no way to argue that this language isn't vague and could invite abuse and you really have to dig into it [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2670.9399999999996s)]
*  But let me just kind of walk you through I think a key part of it. So [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2678.22s)]
*  first of all [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2682.4199999999996s)]
*  This bill doesn't just ban or force the divester of tick-tock. It goes after [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2684.14s)]
*  What it calls foreign adversary controlled applications now, what is a foreign adversary? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2690.9s)]
*  There are four countries that are defined as foreign adversaries. It's basically [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2696.6600000000003s)]
*  Russia China Iran and North Korea. I'm not super worried about that list of foreign adversaries [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2701.7400000000002s)]
*  Growing because that does take a bunch of procedural hoops to go through it [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2708.1800000000003s)]
*  What I am concerned about is when the bill talks about what makes a company [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2712.34s)]
*  Controlled by a foreign adversary and if you go to that language, which is then definition [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2718.4s)]
*  So, you know what frequently happens with these bills is that a lot of the meat is actually in the definitions [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2724.48s)]
*  You have to look at this very carefully it says here [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2729.3599999999997s)]
*  The term control by foreign adversary means with respect to a covered company that such company or entity is and then there's three categories [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2732.08s)]
*  The first category is a foreign person which can also mean a foreign corporation [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2739.42s)]
*  That's domiciled in or is headquartered or has its principal place of business [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2743.6s)]
*  Or is organized under the law of foreign adversary country. So that would be like bite dance. Okay, bite dance is a Chinese company [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2747.52s)]
*  Okay, then it says or it can be an entity [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2754.16s)]
*  Where 20% of the ownership group is in that foreign person category? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2758.08s)]
*  So that would be like you let's say you had a US company [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2763.52s)]
*  But 20% of the company was owned by I don't know Chinese VCs or by bite dance [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2766.92s)]
*  Okay, that would also be a controlled by a foreign adversary [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2773.6s)]
*  then you get to the provision that I think is the most problematic which is [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2778.2s)]
*  it's a person subject to the direction or [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2781.84s)]
*  Control of a foreign person or entity the novel language here is where it says subject to the direction of [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2785.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay, it's not just saying under the control of it's saying subject to the direction of in my view. That's very vague and [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2793.96s)]
*  A [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2801.28s)]
*  creative [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2803.0s)]
*  Prosecutor creative attorney general could try to say well, wait a second if Elon has a major [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2804.32s)]
*  Tesla factory in [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2811.04s)]
*  Shanghai is he subject to the direction of the Chinese Communist Party because they could influence him they could leverage him if [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2813.28s)]
*  Donald Trump is accused on virtually a daily basis of being a Russian asset is he subject to the direction of [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2821.4s)]
*  Vladimir Putin David from just tweeted very recently that he said not only Trump with the entire Republican Party that [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2830.16s)]
*  Works for Trump is under the direction [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2837.3199999999997s)]
*  That's like a partisan hack though. That's not like actual factual in a court, right? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2840.04s)]
*  So this would have to be proven factual in the court. Okay, do you think or no? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2844.52s)]
*  Well, the AG could open an investigation [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2849.64s)]
*  Based on the theory that for example Trump owns true social and Trump is under the direction of a foreign adversary [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2853.48s)]
*  ie Putin because the mainstream media continues to [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2861.32s)]
*  Normalize this idea and spread this idea on virtually a daily basis [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2865.16s)]
*  So the point is that look first the AG would open an investigation you think about the sledgehammer [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2868.96s)]
*  type of remedy here that an [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2875.6s)]
*  Elon or a Trump or a you take rumble for example, which is also accused of being a Russian agent [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2878.6800000000003s)]
*  They could be forced to divest the company or to have it be banned [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2886.56s)]
*  so it gives huge I think new powers to [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2891.1600000000003s)]
*  the [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2895.88s)]
*  Executive branch to pursue political opponents and political enemies [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2897.08s)]
*  Whether they actually win in a court of law down the road is kind of secondary because they can vex and harass [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2900.7599999999998s)]
*  Their political enemies using this power. So my point is that at a minimum I think this language needs to get cleaned up [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2907.84s)]
*  I think it is way too vague and [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2914.22s)]
*  You still have the issue of whether it's a good idea or not to force the banning or divestiture of tik-tok [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2917.96s)]
*  But this bill goes way beyond it again. It creates this [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2924.0s)]
*  Novel category of foreign adversary controlled applications [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2927.88s)]
*  Which also like I said includes websites and that means not just foreign companies but domestic [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2931.88s)]
*  Companies as well that are said to be under the direction of a foreign actor [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2938.44s)]
*  So again, I I don't know how anyone can look at this language and not say it's too vague [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2941.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's easy enough tighten it up [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2948.24s)]
*  And if it was tightened up you'd be in favor of the tick-tock man [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2949.96s)]
*  Or divestiture I should say I keep saying ban you would still want the Chinese government to not have control this or or by dance [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2954.02s)]
*  Yeah, I still have very mixed feelings about the idea of just the the tick-tock ban because look you're talking about an app that 100 [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2960.38s)]
*  million Americans use [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2968.18s)]
*  For something like 90 minutes a day so people obviously get a lot of value out of this I've yet to see the the hard proof [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2971.3s)]
*  That this app is under the control of the CCP [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2978.7999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I know that allegation was made I can understand why they spied on journalists already. Yeah, but [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2981.96s)]
*  It's it's very unclear to me that they have the goods on that and I do think that [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2988.16s)]
*  Depriving Americans of the right to use this app that they clearly enjoy and love [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=2993.94s)]
*  Based on a threat that has yet to be proven that makes me [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3000.04s)]
*  I'm deeply ambivalent about that. If we were to look at say media channels newspapers [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3004.7599999999998s)]
*  There has been rules about foreign ownership of those. Do you believe tick-tock kind of falls into that as sack said? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3010.8399999999997s)]
*  Americans are enjoying this in a massive way hundred million plus 90 minutes a day. The statistics are crazy that actually I think argues for [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3017.7599999999998s)]
*  You know not having a foreign adversary own this or have access to it. We wouldn't allow them to own CNN [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3026.64s)]
*  Fox New York Times Martian Post, etc. We have rules against that already [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3032.6600000000003s)]
*  So are you in favor of this tick-tock divestiture? Yes or no [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3036.58s)]
*  Yeah, okay [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3043.2200000000003s)]
*  Freberg [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3046.78s)]
*  I like to hear I like to hear him expand on that [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3048.78s)]
*  I'll tell you before I tell you why I'll tell you a quick story [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3052.7400000000002s)]
*  Two or three months ago after Joker was sick we started to make his own dog food, right? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3057.1s)]
*  so to have like a super bland diet and we had the service that was sending us food and we got rid of it and [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3062.7799999999997s)]
*  We would just make it ourselves and part of the meal [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3069.42s)]
*  Was like some raw apples and carrots that I would that I would cut up and I would always complain to that. I'm like I hate [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3074.3399999999997s)]
*  Peeling these apples or whatever slicing them and taking the core out just just said that [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3081.6600000000003s)]
*  for the next month and a half all I got was apple coring utensils on tik-tok and [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3087.9s)]
*  She was like, oh, you know, we should get rid of XYZ food service and she would just get plastered with these ads and [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3094.6600000000003s)]
*  It was just a reminder to me that these apps are constantly listening now. That's a benign example [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3101.38s)]
*  But my phone is on my desk when I'm talking about some really important stuff [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3107.1400000000003s)]
*  Again important related to me both personal and professional where there's lots of money on the line. There's moments where [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3112.5800000000004s)]
*  for certain parts of my business like with crypto we have like 19 layers of [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3120.34s)]
*  People that have to you have passwords upon passwords upon passwords to do stuff. The phone is always there [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3126.5s)]
*  It was just a reminder to me so I deleted tik-tok it's gone [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3131.94s)]
*  Which sucks because I would relax with that app at night like, you know, I would have 15 20 minutes where I would be impressed [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3135.54s)]
*  It's super fun. It's a great app. I have to be honest with you. I love it [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3141.54s)]
*  but as a consumer [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3147.34s)]
*  That was a decision I made as a business person what I'll say is [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3150.1400000000003s)]
*  It is inconceivable to me [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3155.9s)]
*  That our voice signatures [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3157.98s)]
*  Aren't being mapped and there isn't a massive [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3161.1800000000003s)]
*  Sort of file and repository that is understanding what we're all saying [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3165.26s)]
*  And it's then further inconceivable to me that there isn't a service [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3171.02s)]
*  That's an identifying that this is probably David Sachs and this is Chamath and this is freebird and we're not really all that important [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3175.9s)]
*  But let's take a better example [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3183.42s)]
*  This is the President of the United States this is or the waiter that works for the president who has his phone in his pocket while he's [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3185.42s)]
*  Sitting inside the you know, the the the residences of the White House [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3193.5s)]
*  So I think it's happening. I think they're not the only one though. I think there's American companies that are doing it, too [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3198.14s)]
*  And so I think that we need to start somewhere [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3206.38s)]
*  Until we can have our apps in a market [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3209.6600000000003s)]
*  They shouldn't have their apps here [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3213.5s)]
*  And I think that should be the end of it completely reasonable. I think i'm going to disagree. I think a couple points [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3216.06s)]
*  I don't believe [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3223.42s)]
*  In the notion of like reciprocity for reciprocity sake [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3224.94s)]
*  China blocks access to u.s content. Does that mean the u.s government should block access to international content? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3229.1800000000003s)]
*  I think the answer is no because this country is different than china. We have [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3235.58s)]
*  Afforded ourselves freedoms and liberties that don't exist in other countries freedom of choice [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3240.62s)]
*  Freedom of speech freedom of the press and so on so I don't think that the government should be restricting access to content [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3246.2999999999997s)]
*  Because another country restricts access to our content. I think that we should make decisions [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3252.62s)]
*  Based on what's right for the citizens. What's right for the country? What's right for national security? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3257.74s)]
*  Based on what's right for the citizens what's right for the country what's right for national security. What about spying apps? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3261.9s)]
*  So that's a that's that's my my next point. So I do think that if there is a case [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3267.6600000000003s)]
*  To be made that there is spying or data acquisition that's going on through these apps [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3271.7400000000002s)]
*  We're not talking about rice noodles over here, you know, we're talking about [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3276.78s)]
*  And so I think if if that's true then I would imagine that there are [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3280.7000000000003s)]
*  Multiple paths to alleviate that like move all the servers to the u.s and separate the entity force a sale [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3284.54s)]
*  You know like I think I don't think that it's necessarily [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3290.2200000000003s)]
*  Appropriate to say that there aren't other courses or other options available [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3293.6600000000003s)]
*  To try and prohibit what should generally be prohibited [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3298.3s)]
*  Which is spying on american citizens [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3302.2200000000003s)]
*  and capturing data that people [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3304.94s)]
*  You know haven't [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3307.5s)]
*  Opted into being captured [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3308.78s)]
*  I do believe that citizens and people should have the right to decide if they want to have their data used [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3310.14s)]
*  To be able to access an app. I actually am not a big believer [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3315.26s)]
*  That we should be paternalistic in the government sense and saying [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3318.72s)]
*  Having the government come in and say here's an app and we have determined [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3321.92s)]
*  That it is not good for you because this data is being used in a manipulative way against you [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3326.24s)]
*  I think that citizens should be afforded transparency and make a decision about whether or not they want to participate in that [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3330.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't think citizens have the sophistication to understand what foreign adversaries [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3336.0s)]
*  Again, we only have four so they were named there for a reason are doing with our data and I don't think that they should [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3340.72s)]
*  Have to be forced to choose. I think that you know, this is not dissimilar to how the FDA says [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3346.8s)]
*  You're not qualified to decide whether this drug is good [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3351.52s)]
*  We will tell you and people are okay with that because you are saying this is part of the government infrastructure [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3354.32s)]
*  That's full of experts who know the totality of a subject [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3359.76s)]
*  And so the problem is in order for anybody to make a reasonable decision [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3363.52s)]
*  You'd have to share so much as to just completely blow up a bunch of national security, which is not going to happen [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3366.5600000000004s)]
*  Well, look, I think we can have audit rights and we can have rights that protect our citizens [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3371.76s)]
*  I think that that's appropriate. I i'll also say my final point on this. I think that [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3375.12s)]
*  Whether it's intentional or not [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3380.48s)]
*  This sort of action leads to inevitable cronyism and regulatory capture [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3382.96s)]
*  Who does this benefit if tick tock gets banned in the u.s. It's going to benefit meta. It's going to benefit instagram [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3387.6s)]
*  It's going to benefit a few other, you know social networks going to benefit elon at twitter [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3393.6s)]
*  There's a few folks that are going to benefit pretty significantly if tick tock is banned because all those users are going to migrate [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3397.92s)]
*  I will also say by the way that many thousands of people make their living on tick tock like it or not [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3403.68s)]
*  It's a big income stream for a lot of people in the u.s [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3409.8399999999997s)]
*  And a really important part of their livelihood and just to be clear here. This is not about banning tick tock [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3412.48s)]
*  This is about divestiture [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3417.12s)]
*  Then if it's not divested then it gets banned [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3419.12s)]
*  So if you just think from first principles here, why wouldn't they divest why would yeah? [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3421.68s)]
*  This happens all the time keep this the reason is [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3427.04s)]
*  This is a incredibly powerful tool under no circumstances [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3430.48s)]
*  Would the chinese government ever allow us to have this kind of reach into their populace? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3434.88s)]
*  And if you want to judge a person you can just look at their behavior [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3439.6s)]
*  Citizens in china live [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3443.26s)]
*  Either in a complete police state where everything they do is tracked every transaction [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3445.28s)]
*  Facial recognition every step they take every purchase they make is tracked or you're in a literal concentration camp [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3450.72s)]
*  That's how the people of china live today [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3458.32s)]
*  We are their adversary they have noted that were their adversary [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3461.28s)]
*  Under what circumstance would you think they would treat us any differently than they treat their own citizens? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3465.6000000000004s)]
*  It is absolutely insane [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3471.28s)]
*  That anybody would take the side of the ccp on this you are asking them to divest you're not asking them to shut it down [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3473.44s)]
*  That is a partisan sort of angle on this and there's a lot of partisanship going on [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3481.1200000000003s)]
*  On the edges on this but what we have to realize is they would never allow us to do this to their citizens [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3486.88s)]
*  And how they treat their citizens is obvious as an example. We've tried, you know, we tried to export sugar [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3492.4s)]
*  Via mcdonald's and coke and actually they have domestic brands that they were able to support and prop up [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3498.56s)]
*  So they have more control of that too [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3503.2000000000003s)]
*  So even even even our downstream attempts to actually send products that theoretically over long periods of time aren't necessarily beneficial [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3504.64s)]
*  They've act they're smart enough to actually blunt. Yeah, and they don't let their kids play video games or use tiktok [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3512.88s)]
*  Well, even video games they saw video games are bad. It's not like they're like, oh activision. Come on in the doors are open [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3518.48s)]
*  They're like you can use it an hour. No, I think it's like three hours a week and certain kids [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3523.44s)]
*  And on the weekends and certain kids are totally banned. They have an ability to make strategic decisions that benefit their population [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3528.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think that we have never attempted to i'm not saying that this law is going to be great [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3535.04s)]
*  But you'd have to be extremely naive to assume that there is nothing bad going on here with this app [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3540.72s)]
*  It doesn't mean that there's nothing bad going on with all the other apps [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3546.88s)]
*  I am assuming that all these apps have foreign actors that have infiltrated them. I think that's the right posture to have [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3550.24s)]
*  I don't have instagram on my phone. I don't have facebook on my phone. I don't have tiktok anymore on my phone [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3557.36s)]
*  The only thing that's left is x [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3562.56s)]
*  And at some point [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3565.68s)]
*  If those apps can prove that there's a chain of custody [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3567.68s)]
*  so for example [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3570.88s)]
*  You know one thing that I thought of you could do [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3571.92s)]
*  Is you could put some kind of like itar regulations around this so that only u.s. Citizens could work on these apps [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3574.3199999999997s)]
*  any app that is [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3580.64s)]
*  ambiently observing you [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3582.46s)]
*  I think the overwhelming majority of people there's it's very benign implications [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3584.7999999999997s)]
*  But the whole point is that if you have 300 million people that are being observed [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3589.7599999999998s)]
*  You're going to get also the the a thousand or ten thousand that are super important [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3594.98s)]
*  And you're going to catch stuff that you're not allowed to know and that's not ready doing this pull up the article nick [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3600.26s)]
*  tiktok has already [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3607.38s)]
*  Admitted to and been caught with their hand in the cookie jar spying on journalists [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3609.0600000000004s)]
*  We know that they're doing this already and we know their track record for spying on their own people [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3613.86s)]
*  This is the no-brainer of no-brainer decisions [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3619.78s)]
*  Just divest and if they won't divest it tells you everything you need to know [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3623.14s)]
*  This is super valuable to them and that algorithm is so valuable that they know they can program the u.s [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3627.62s)]
*  Citizenry, I think the other problem is i'm not sure that the people with the technical sophistication [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3633.84s)]
*  Will have the time to then actually go and audit the code base to really know that there aren't any easter eggs in here [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3639.94s)]
*  And there aren't real backdoors and they won't so this is my point. I think divestiture should not be allowed [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3645.62s)]
*  I actually just think unfortunately this app should just be shut down [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3651.06s)]
*  And the people will migrate to instagram and the people will migrate to youtube and new products and or new products [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3654.1s)]
*  And the thing there is that at least these are american controlled and are there data leaks happening in those apps? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3661.38s)]
*  Probably [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3668.0s)]
*  But it's at least not so brazenly obvious [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3669.22s)]
*  Sacks your thoughts i'm a little confused here [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3672.34s)]
*  Are you guys saying that the chinese government uses tiktok to spy on its own population or they ban it? [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3674.42s)]
*  Because they think it's harmful [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3680.5s)]
*  No, they ban tiktok there because it's harmful. No, they have complete control over tiktok [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3682.26s)]
*  Yes, and they control that in their country. They use [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3686.5s)]
*  Camera sacks and you know this full well on every single corner with facial recognition and every one of their phones is tracked [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3689.94s)]
*  You know this full well sacks. They are spying on their populace or not. No, they have banned tiktok [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3697.86s)]
*  They have a different version called they have a different version [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3703.54s)]
*  And in that version and by the way and they push math duyan's algorithms are very different they push educational content [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3706.2599999999998s)]
*  There's so basically like on the on the bike dance board [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3713.7s)]
*  What happened with this whole thing is the the ceo and the founder had to step down effectively, right? [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3717.22s)]
*  They brought in effectively new management and in that [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3723.62s)]
*  The ccp had is a board of a board director and has what's called the golden vote [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3726.5s)]
*  So they effectively decide and so what you saw were the algorithms morph over time from pure entertainment [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3732.26s)]
*  to things that [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3738.5800000000004s)]
*  Pushed a lot of educational content. They also then imposed broadly speaking [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3740.02s)]
*  Limits on content that they didn't like they would only allow in other [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3745.7000000000003s)]
*  apps [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3750.5s)]
*  Experiences where they also have a board seat now and a golden vote as jason said games can only be played in certain [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3751.7000000000003s)]
*  Apps for certain amounts of time, so they've made their own decisions about what's good for their own population [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3758.42s)]
*  The flavor of the app that's here my my biggest point is that again you have to pick the lesser evil [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3764.42s)]
*  I think it's pretty reasonable to assume that all these apps are infiltrated [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3770.98s)]
*  But this one is more brazen because it is really the only one that's completely and obviously foreign control [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3776.74s)]
*  And I don't think that if you try to divest it [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3783.46s)]
*  You will get any assurance that that code is reliable and so you'd have to build the whole thing from scratch all over again [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3786.1s)]
*  For what it's worth the company has said that they're willing to move all of their [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3790.9s)]
*  hosting in the u.s. To oracle [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3795.46s)]
*  data centers in the u.s. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3798.74s)]
*  David you and I know what that means like could you imagine a migration like that? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3800.74s)]
*  Who is going to look at every single end point every single line of code? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3804.3399999999997s)]
*  That is a joke that's meant to allay people who are non-technical right? Yep. Yeah, I kind of agree with that [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3807.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I kind of agree with them [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3813.54s)]
*  All right. It seems like we're I don't know if we're 2v2 here [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3815.86s)]
*  But look, are you ban or not ban sax with the language is corrected. Are you ban or divest or what? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3818.58s)]
*  I'm ambivalent about it because i'm open to the idea [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3824.1s)]
*  of banning the foreign app in this way [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3828.02s)]
*  but [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3832.2599999999998s)]
*  the reason why i'm a little bit ambivalent about it is because [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3833.54s)]
*  A I think that what they're doing has to be proven as opposed to just a bunch of hand waving over it [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3837.46s)]
*  And when you start talking about what's happening to the Uyghurs at concentration camps [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3843.7s)]
*  And the spying that has nothing to do with this particular app [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3847.3s)]
*  And in fact, you've revealed this app doesn't even function in china [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3850.66s)]
*  I think this is a lot of hand waving going on not a lot of hard proof [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3853.94s)]
*  And I don't think that one little story in the new york times [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3857.7s)]
*  I would consider a hard proof. I agree with sax. Yeah, so that's number one is i'm open to this idea [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3860.98s)]
*  But I want to see hard proof number two is I don't think you're gonna get it [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3866.2599999999998s)]
*  I think the NSA and the cia will read in [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3870.18s)]
*  The the intelligence committee and there's a subcommittee that's probably been read in but I can guarantee you the american public will not get [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3873.2999999999997s)]
*  Read in on what manchin said on cnbc today, by the way that you know, he has [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3879.54s)]
*  Based on his information he believes strongly that they should divest whether it's to his group or another group [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3884.8199999999997s)]
*  But these guys have lied so many times about so many things [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3889.7s)]
*  I mean [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3892.66s)]
*  I just think the public has a right to know look if 100 million americans are going to be deprived of using an app [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3893.14s)]
*  They love why can't we get a little bit more information? Well, but not exactly what I think that app has done wrong [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3897.78s)]
*  They're saying it they're saying it's in control. It's it's being controlled by a foreign advocacy. They are saying it the the bill says it [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3903.5400000000004s)]
*  What is debatable they're telling you means all that means is that the app is owned by bite dance, which is [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3911.38s)]
*  Here's what's unique about this which is incorporated in china. Here's what here's what's unique about this bill [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3917.7000000000003s)]
*  It got out of committee 50 to zero [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3923.0600000000004s)]
*  It was overwhelmingly approved by both sides of the house [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3925.46s)]
*  And it looks like in the senate there may be some refinements that happen, but it's going to get largely overwhelmingly approved there as well [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3928.98s)]
*  It's a very very great act. Hold on. It's a very unique moment in time where you see in today's political landscape [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3935.7000000000003s)]
*  Such uniformity and again, i'm not going to go and defend these folks but except to say that [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3944.1000000000004s)]
*  Where there's smoke there's probably fire and I think that in this specific narrow case again [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3950.1s)]
*  We're not talking about food stuffs or lumber, right? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3955.62s)]
*  We're talking about a technological application that is observing a lot of people on a continuous 24 by 7 basis [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3959.06s)]
*  I suspect this this law would not have gotten out of committee 50 to zero had they not been read in [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3966.8199999999997s)]
*  By the nsa and the cia and that will never see the light of day because we will never see the light of day [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3973.06s)]
*  Because we will never be disclosed that information [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3979.3s)]
*  Okay, so it could have been 49 to 1 david. You know what I mean? [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3982.26s)]
*  Hold on one second. Let me respond to that. If it's ideological I could see it being 40 to 10 [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3986.02s)]
*  If it's ideological I could be seeing it 35 to 15 48 to 2. It was 50 to 0 [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3990.98s)]
*  So was the patriot act look there's an old saying in washington that the worst ideas are bipartisan [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=3997.3s)]
*  These guys were all being stampeded into this act [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4003.1400000000003s)]
*  They brought it up and passed it with hardly any debate [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4006.02s)]
*  I've already shown you how the language of the bill is overly broad. It's not just a tick tock ban [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4009.22s)]
*  It says that any app or website. Did you know that any app or website domestically? [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4015.3s)]
*  That's subject subject to the direction of [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4021.7s)]
*  a foreigner [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4025.46s)]
*  From one of these countries four countries north korea russia china. I said a foreigner from one of those countries [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4026.74s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm trying to make it clear for the audience. All you gotta do is make that argument [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4031.94s)]
*  If you're an ag who wants to go after one of our domestic platforms [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4035.8599999999997s)]
*  That's all you got to do to bring them under your thumb. What would be the proper [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4039.8599999999997s)]
*  route if [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4043.2999999999997s)]
*  A us platform was in fact compromised by the chinese north koreans or iran [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4044.74s)]
*  What would be the proper path in your mind wouldn't that concern you if an app? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4050.74s)]
*  Is sharing us data in a way that it shouldn't then why wouldn't it just be prosecuted? [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4054.74s)]
*  Which is what this is saying right the ag's would go after it's not it's not it's not even it's banning [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4061.06s)]
*  Tick-tock okay subject to maybe divestiture happens [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4065.3799999999997s)]
*  But there's a lot of people who think that the six months are giving for this is it's not going to work [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4068.4199999999996s)]
*  And the chinese government may not go for the idea of allowing tick-tock to be bought by [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4072.2599999999998s)]
*  An american company because they may not like the precedent that creates so again [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4077.22s)]
*  I think you're answering your own question. I think you're making a very important and good point [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4081.54s)]
*  Which is there's so much body of business law here [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4085.2999999999997s)]
*  And there's so many state ag's who would want to make their bones [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4089.06s)]
*  And you see the state ag's trying to build their credibility [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4092.98s)]
*  Going after facebook for sexual exploitation and all of this stuff there to your point david [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4096.58s)]
*  There is such a body of lawsuits and law and precedent that tick-tock could have been prosecuted under [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4101.860000000001s)]
*  It's very odd and rare that there's been a complete detente [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4108.58s)]
*  Where this thing came on from up above and everybody just got on board and all i'm saying is [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4112.74s)]
*  in these very rare and unique instances where somebody [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4118.1s)]
*  Shelled their own personal political aspirations [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4121.54s)]
*  No, I think I think it's quite the opposite that we don't know [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4125.219999999999s)]
*  My alarm bells go off when dc acts with this kind of unanimity because the only time they ever do that [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4128.74s)]
*  When they become a uniparty is when the national security state wants some new power. I agree with you [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4134.339999999999s)]
*  That's what i'm saying. This is how we got into the last war basically almost unanimous. This is how we got into the patriot act [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4139.219999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying it's right. I'm not saying it's right. Every dumb idea that gives the federal government more power [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4144.66s)]
*  Ends up being almost unanimous, but you're absolutely right and i'm agreeing with you [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4151.379999999999s)]
*  They were read in at a national security level that got them to become a uniparty on this topic [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4155.7s)]
*  We are never going to get and i'm just you know responding to freeburg [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4161.299999999999s)]
*  We're never going to get read in we the people because of this like phony concern about [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4164.58s)]
*  They always like classification when they don't want the public to know something now, by the way, this important should be secret [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4169.94s)]
*  But by the way, give us the proof why can't they give us the proof? I don't think it needs to be proof [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4174.58s)]
*  It's the potential damage here that they're saying is the problem sax they could wake up this algorithm at any point in time [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4178.66s)]
*  and they could steer people's thinking they have already steered it your [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4186.099999999999s)]
*  Party has talked incessantly about how tiktok has steered [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4190.58s)]
*  Cultural issues in a certain direction thus libs of tiktok all this kind of stuff. There is ample evidence that these [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4195.7s)]
*  Social networks and these videos do influence young people [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4204.02s)]
*  So if young people are addicted to this which they clearly are and if young people are influenced by this which they clearly are [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4207.62s)]
*  Those are just facts that are indisputable [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4213.7s)]
*  The chinese could wake this up at any time and steer political issues left right center cause chaos [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4216.74s)]
*  It is the potential harm here sax that is the concern [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4222.66s)]
*  It's not just that they're doing it now. It's that they could do it in the future [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4226.74s)]
*  And if you were to take this and you were to put let's say this was north korea or iran [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4231.219999999999s)]
*  Would your would you allow north korea? [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4235.78s)]
*  Or iran to own this app in the united states? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4238.5s)]
*  Of course, he wouldn't I think my my point would be the same which is I want to see some proof [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4241.46s)]
*  Hold on. Let me make a couple of points number one. I want to see some proof [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4246.58s)]
*  That this is actually spyware that to me has been alleged [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4250.0199999999995s)]
*  And if it's as such a slam dunk case as you say, why is there no proof of this? [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4253.86s)]
*  So that's point number one [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4259.3s)]
*  And by the way, if if the phone is just sitting there passively listening to you and that's the spyware [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4261.54s)]
*  Apple should really address that because the app shouldn't be able to do that, right? [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4266.18s)]
*  So that's like apple's problem with respect to the data [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4270.58s)]
*  Supposedly being leaked to the communist party again. I want to see what data are we talking about like [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4274.34s)]
*  Like what tick tock videos I like what what's important about that data? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4281.06s)]
*  There are bundles of data that are available on the open market that they can buy it about users [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4285.7s)]
*  I don't think that's what it is. These these microphones are on 24 7 [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4291.22s)]
*  These apps are allowed to passively listen in the background. Then why don't we just hold apple not to allow that [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4295.38s)]
*  I think that that could be a partial solve to well [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4301.06s)]
*  What about your phone should not be passively listening to you [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4303.54s)]
*  You should have to like stick it in your face and talk to it if you want to activate the microphone [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4305.7s)]
*  The problem is when you download these apps you create these settings [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4310.26s)]
*  And so you try to you have to try to convince 100 million people that hey [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4312.9s)]
*  You shouldn't do that [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4316.74s)]
*  Maybe you should only do it when you use the app in a specific way and it kills the usability and so people get [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4318.0199999999995s)]
*  Lazy and they're like default on look what i'm saying here is that the way the microphone should work [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4323.7s)]
*  On apple products is that I think it does work that way [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4330.42s)]
*  Yeah, it shouldn't I think it does work that way. I don't know if that's okay listening in is like the key issue here [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4335.219999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean who knows what's possible in terms of hacking and spyware [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4341.139999999999s)]
*  You know those are all [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4345.78s)]
*  You know unknowns so okay. So so one by one we're kind of knocking knocking out all these issues [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4348.099999999999s)]
*  It's not passively listening the data that is collecting doesn't seem we don't know does it seem that important with respect to steering? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4353.54s)]
*  I agree. I guess that's a theoretical problem [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4360.82s)]
*  But you could say that about any of these apps and you're on a slippery slope to basically a first amendment problem [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4363.3s)]
*  Because they're not letting users get the content that they actually want [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4368.9s)]
*  All right, I guess I'll read it [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4373.219999999999s)]
*  And then and then I look and then one final point about the reciprocity argument is [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4375.38s)]
*  If you want to make this about reciprocity then put it in a trade bill [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4380.5s)]
*  That's where you deal with reciprocity is you say okay [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4385.94s)]
*  These products from china gets it to play in u.s [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4389.86s)]
*  Markets our products from the united states gets play in chinese markets you do it through a trade bill [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4392.179999999999s)]
*  This is not a trade bill. This gives a new power to the government to define foreign adversary [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4396.66s)]
*  Controlled applications and websites freebridge wanted to give you a chance to answer the two questions [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4401.86s)]
*  Are you in favor of divestiture if it was iran who owned the app would you feel differently? [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4406.26s)]
*  I don't know about [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4412.34s)]
*  divestiture [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4414.88s)]
*  Until to sax's point. I just I haven't heard a clear point of view or clear like piece of information about [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4416.98s)]
*  What this app uniquely does that other apps don't do [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4424.9800000000005s)]
*  That creates a threat. It's just not clear to me. So in general i'm not in fan of like forcing companies to divest and [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4428.900000000001s)]
*  Forcing things to be shut down and taking away human consumer choice. I just don't think those are good things generally [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4437.14s)]
*  Okay, and i'm not to sax's point. I'm just not compelled that there's something here based on what i've seen and then like if iran owned tiktok [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4442.66s)]
*  I don't care who owns it based on my prior statement. I I think people should have choice to [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4450.52s)]
*  Use what they want to use provided that there is no spying if they're spying [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4455.56s)]
*  I want to know that they're spying and how it's happening [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4459.400000000001s)]
*  We need to technically fix that if someone can passively turn on a microphone on an app and listen to people in a room [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4461.320000000001s)]
*  Yes, they can smart scientists. We've proven that it's possible and they can also we should fix that [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4467.56s)]
*  That's we can also know your location. That's a bigger problem. Then you need to shut down all the iphones [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4471.72s)]
*  We have there's an israeli software company. We all know what it's called. We all can go and license the software from them [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4475.72s)]
*  Okay, they they will help you do this. So yeah, i'm sorry guys [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4481.72s)]
*  Apple needs to patch it that's exactly right [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4488.52s)]
*  That's because it doesn't solve the problem. I don't want a domestic app to be able to do that to me. Yeah [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4490.52s)]
*  Exactly. It is happening and it hasn't been fixed and it's not that it hasn't been fixed [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4495.160000000001s)]
*  The point is when you have a large technical surface area, you guys know this [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4499.56s)]
*  There are bugs all the time like we deal with for example [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4503.88s)]
*  Threat vectors all the time into like microsoft has dealt with these for 50 years, right every new update of windows [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4507.400000000001s)]
*  Every little thing has all these little back doors and little threads that weren't cleaned up properly. So this is an ongoing [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4513.72s)]
*  Whack-a-mole problem and the reality is that a very small technical team [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4520.76s)]
*  Has and always been able to stay a few steps ahead of apple [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4525.160000000001s)]
*  And many of these apps and all i'm saying is you should just not be so naive as to assume that this apple is something that [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4530.4400000000005s)]
*  This is something apple can fix. I think that a small talented team of hackers [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4536.12s)]
*  Whoever they work for will always be able to find these back doors in every single new release of every single operating system [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4541.400000000001s)]
*  And they will be a few steps ahead. So [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4547.56s)]
*  But then we're screwed anyway, because all the data is already out there. So I think the point is so knowing that [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4549.8s)]
*  If you want to maybe minimize the surface area of how bad this data leaks to [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4556.2s)]
*  Just the foreign actors that have infiltrated our american companies you can ban tick tock [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4561.48s)]
*  Okay [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4566.28s)]
*  If you want to just open the door to it [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4567.24s)]
*  Keep it around look like I said at the beginning i'm ambivalent about this because if you can prove to me [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4569.5599999999995s)]
*  That there's really a national security threat and that your remedy for dealing with it is narrowly tailored [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4574.2s)]
*  Then i'm potentially on board with this [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4580.12s)]
*  But I don't believe the threat has been proven and I certainly don't think the remedy is narrowly tailored in fact [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4581.72s)]
*  It's expansive and it's going to lead to weaponization and I don't trust the government to define [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4587.0s)]
*  new new [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4592.2s)]
*  categories of foreign controlled applications and websites, I think you're probably right which is the unfortunate part, but I I do think that [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4593.7s)]
*  There's enough of these folks that have been read into something that we're not being told [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4602.280000000001s)]
*  And I have zero faith in that [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4606.76s)]
*  Yeah, i'm not i'm not going to say that it's accurate or not, but i'm saying [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4609.400000000001s)]
*  I suspect that some body of work from a [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4613.64s)]
*  Three-letter agency has made its way to enough of these people [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4617.64s)]
*  Under confidentiality where they've all agreed the national security state has a secret reason for wanting to expand its powers [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4621.72s)]
*  That just doesn't fill me with any confidence [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4630.280000000001s)]
*  Again patriot act 2.0. That's where I started with this [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4632.92s)]
*  I don't think this is the patriot act because the patriot act was like i'm going to have now a broad license to probe [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4635.24s)]
*  Anything I want this is about saying this thing that is here can no longer be here [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4640.36s)]
*  So that's not focused on tiktok. It's focused on again first [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4645.48s)]
*  Includes websites the the patriot act was about the government being able to go proactively [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4653.0s)]
*  Wherever they wanted when they weren't allowed [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4658.92s)]
*  That is not what this bill says this bill is more reactive and saying [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4661.879999999999s)]
*  Uh, okay you out out of the sandbox and all i'm saying is you're right that that could be abused [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4665.639999999999s)]
*  But that's very different than the patriot act which was very [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4670.919999999999s)]
*  aggressive [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4674.66s)]
*  All right, so there you have it folks two people looks like agree with the divestiture two people have [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4676.919999999999s)]
*  A difference of opinion. Let's go. I don't agree with the divestiture. I I think it should be shut down. Okay shut down [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4684.2s)]
*  Yeah, so shut down divestiture looks like lots of opinions. That's good lots of opinions. That's good [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4688.92s)]
*  Okay, I think we just had more debate over this than the entire u.s. Congress did [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4693.64s)]
*  perhaps I mean, I think that's why people listen to this program is because we're literally getting into the [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4697.72s)]
*  Absolute finest details and asking really probing questions sex that you love a hundred million people are soon going to be asking [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4703.06s)]
*  When tiktok gets shut down a hundred million people who used it every day are going to be like why did this happen? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4709.96s)]
*  I'm going to say something about that [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4715.56s)]
*  One of my kids and i'm not going to say who it is [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4718.280000000001s)]
*  We recently had them tested for adhd. They weren't doing particularly great in school [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4721.0s)]
*  the [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4726.04s)]
*  Response by some of the folks in the school was oh [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4727.64s)]
*  There's meds for that. We're like no meds [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4731.240000000001s)]
*  And what we did was we took away their ipad [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4735.160000000001s)]
*  And we completely deprived them of all these apps and video games [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4739.0s)]
*  I cannot describe to you [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4745.160000000001s)]
*  The magnitude of the turnaround in this kid [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4747.72s)]
*  grades [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4751.160000000001s)]
*  Incredible where they were getting 60 and 70 now getting 90 [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4753.56s)]
*  Totally engaged interesting charming kid [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4760.52s)]
*  That had lost a little bit [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4764.92s)]
*  And I think that there was a little bit of a daze and I just want to say that in general as a parent [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4767.080000000001s)]
*  Whether the app is banned or not. Who cares my lived experience right now is that [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4772.68s)]
*  Video games and these apps [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4777.4800000000005s)]
*  Are horrible for kids? [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4780.4400000000005s)]
*  This is a known fact actually jamaf. I've looked into this as well. It turns out [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4782.76s)]
*  Students who used ipads and digital media many times a day [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4788.76s)]
*  They show the exact signs of adhd inattention and hyperactivity and impulsivity [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4792.04s)]
*  so [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4797.88s)]
*  Whether you think adhd is a real diagnosis or not. It's inducing those symptoms [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4799.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm willing to say that my child probably had a very light form of it [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4804.36s)]
*  Maybe it was exacerbated by these video games and the ipad [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4807.96s)]
*  And these apps and you know [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4811.72s)]
*  They were getting all the tiktok content [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4813.64s)]
*  But they were getting it on youtube [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4816.4400000000005s)]
*  Alerts all of a sudden anyways [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4819.88s)]
*  Went to zero not like you can have a little bit here or there zero and the transformation in this last month and a half [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4822.04s)]
*  two months has been [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4827.64s)]
*  Incredible. I don't know if other parents are dealing with this [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4829.56s)]
*  But what i'll tell you is theaps apps are not good. So this whole consumer choice thing [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4832.12s)]
*  I think my view is a little tainted because I get agitated as a responsible parent [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4837.08s)]
*  I'm like just get this app out of here and I already know that i'm addicted to it and it's not good for me [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4840.92s)]
*  I have no idea what it's doing to my my kids and I just don't want to deal with it [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4845.8s)]
*  if you um [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4850.44s)]
*  If you look at the correlation between all of these symptoms showing up in kids, it's basically the introduction of the iphone [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4851.64s)]
*  and so [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4857.8s)]
*  People are kind of reaching consensus that the iphone and distraction adhd spiking depression [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4859.0s)]
*  All this stuff anxiety and kids is correlating with too much screen time. You can do your own research folks [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4864.92s)]
*  Maybe it correlates with prescription of ssris [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4870.52s)]
*  maybe it [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4874.28s)]
*  Well, no, that is part of it with [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4875.56s)]
*  with um schools going totally woke and bananas [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4877.88s)]
*  I call it a lot of things the covid definitely exacerbated [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4881.24s)]
*  Covid exacerbated it when you look at the the trend lines for sure and the ssris and those kind of things being [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4885.64s)]
*  Prescribed is probably as a result of these adhd symptoms coming from screen time and then it's probably unnecessary [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4894.28s)]
*  I think people just got a lot more prescription happy like they're just definitely that over prescription [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4901.8s)]
*  Kids on drugs for I mean you talk about adhd for young boys. That's kind of like this normal behavior [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4907.8s)]
*  Yeah, no, absolutely like kids running around outside and having energy if I had to pick an age [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4915.08s)]
*  I would say 16 17 18 years old for social media and for phones. I would say 15 or 16 [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4920.28s)]
*  You know with a very controlled phone. So that's that's just one person's opinion [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4925.96s)]
*  All right, florida's on the verge of banning lab-grown meat. Freiburg. Can you tee this up for us? [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4930.12s)]
*  Yeah, so florida's been debating a bill [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4935.32s)]
*  In their state legislature since november [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4938.6s)]
*  And it just passed the house and the senate a vote of 86 27 in the house 28 20 in the senate [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4941.34s)]
*  to prohibit the manufacturing sale holding or distribution of cultivated meat and it [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4947.74s)]
*  Basically makes the sale or ownership of cultivated meat a second degree misdemeanor. This is lab-grown meat [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4953.74s)]
*  and this bill [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4960.0599999999995s)]
*  Is now on de santis's desk for signing [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4962.7s)]
*  You know, i'll kind of highlight a little bit of the motivation and and some of the technical background in my point of view on it [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4965.259999999999s)]
*  If that's okay, but do you do you see him eating the meat while you're talking about? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4970.38s)]
*  Did you see him eating the meat? I'm paying attention unlike you guys [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4974.139999999999s)]
*  He's got this like flinstone size ham hog. We're all this and good [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4978.46s)]
*  It feels like a like a non-issue to folks who eat meat and don't care [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4982.38s)]
*  But I just want to point out how much of this is generally a challenge to [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4986.38s)]
*  Enabling choice in new innovative technology, which you know, we've seen attempts at this in the past [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4990.22s)]
*  But what is the reason to what is the reason to ban lab-grown meat? They love to ban in florida [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=4996.54s)]
*  The motivation is that florida ranchers felt threatened the guy who just has been advocating [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5003.1s)]
*  For banning tiktok this whole show is now accusing florida of being into banning [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5008.780000000001s)]
*  Are you your boy? Ron de santis loves to bitch. I'm the only person on this pod [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5013.58s)]
*  Who actually freeberg is too who are skeptical of like does kneejerk banning everything ban everything I would not ban this [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5017.5s)]
*  I didn't say to ban everything. Where where is that? We're just joking don't don't label me with your jcal brush [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5025.02s)]
*  Let's say bad everything [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5032.7s)]
*  It's definitely becoming a minority position to be against government [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5035.58s)]
*  intervention in [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5040.360000000001s)]
*  Government intervention in free decision making and commerce by individual citizens [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5041.98s)]
*  Florida ranchers felt that their livelihood was threatened [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5048.219999999999s)]
*  They have a billion dollar ranching business a year in florida good for them [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5051.259999999999s)]
*  They should go ahead and compete with whatever new technology is emerging. I would say try a little role reversal [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5055.0199999999995s)]
*  Imagine if you know governments and states tried to ban the use of the tractor for fear of putting agricultural workers out of business [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5060.94s)]
*  Or, you know software companies that did accounting software got banned [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5068.299999999999s)]
*  Because it could put accountants out of business or electric car production and use got banned because it could put traditional automotive [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5072.46s)]
*  Manufacturers out of business you could go down the list and you could create this position on nearly any new or emerging technology [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5079.24s)]
*  That feels threatening to an incumbent industry and ultimately it really only yields [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5085.5s)]
*  to regulatory capture [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5090.219999999999s)]
*  And to a lack of choice [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5092.3s)]
*  And opportunity for new innovation and for consumers to make decisions about what they want and the irony here [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5093.9800000000005s)]
*  Is that so much of what's being consumed in the market space today? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5099.900000000001s)]
*  Part of their their rationalization is oh, well, it's new technology. We don't know if it's good for you [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5103.820000000001s)]
*  We don't know if it's going to work. The truth is there are federal regulatory bodies that have oversight on this sort of thing 20 years ago [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5108.06s)]
*  Almost all the cheese that we ate in the united states was made from rennet rennet is an enzyme that converts the protein and milk into cheese [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5114.54s)]
*  We got rennet from the stomach of calves. We would scrape it out and sell rennet and it would be used to make cheese [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5122.22s)]
*  then recombinant engineering where we could put [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5128.62s)]
*  We could get bacteria or yeast cells to make proteins [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5131.740000000001s)]
*  This technology unlocked the opportunity to make rennet more affordably [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5135.66s)]
*  So rather than go and slaughter calves and get the rennet out of their stomach [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5139.58s)]
*  We engineer the bacteria or the yeast cell to make the exact same protein [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5142.9400000000005s)]
*  And that is now the entirety of the rennet industry [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5146.78s)]
*  Is recombinantly produced rennet and the entirety of cheese that we all consume is made using this genetically modified yeast that makes this enzyme [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5149.5s)]
*  That converts milk into cheese [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5157.18s)]
*  The same is true across other industries. We used to use animal fat for laundry detergent turned out [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5159.18s)]
*  It was a lot cheaper to make enzymes using the same process [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5164.22s)]
*  I just described instead of making animal fat and now all of our laundry detergent is recombinant enzymes [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5167.5s)]
*  So I think like this notion that we're going to ban this stuff [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5172.3s)]
*  Is a regulatory capture incumbency moment. It's totally wrong [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5176.46s)]
*  It denies consumers choice and frankly it flies in the face of what has historically been a real economic opportunity [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5180.06s)]
*  To bring costs down to bring new innovation to market and to try and stall that innovation is going to leave [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5186.78s)]
*  The state or this country you're right in a real kind of challenge compared to other countries. I just think it's wrong [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5192.22s)]
*  I think it's really on this topic. You are 100 right? [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5196.86s)]
*  You're right. This is a dumb thing to legislate and it is [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5201.02s)]
*  Meaningless and unimpactful and people should just decide based on [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5205.099999999999s)]
*  What tastes better? [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5209.66s)]
*  Is this that's different than a listening device or cheaper or whatever? [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5211.099999999999s)]
*  Free break is it [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5215.0199999999995s)]
*  Is the criticism of this that it's regulatory capture or it's part of like this anti-woke kind of vibes in florida [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5217.58s)]
*  There's a conservative movement in florida, which has taken hold which I think this is key to [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5224.54s)]
*  Now in some ways I would argue that conservative movement has [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5230.38s)]
*  Really important sociological points of view [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5234.38s)]
*  In other cases, I think it denies [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5237.9s)]
*  Necessary innovation it denies necessary advancement to move industry forward versus social change [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5241.32s)]
*  And I think the the the ability to kind of obfuscate the two that oh, you know [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5247.42s)]
*  Transgenderism in schools and elementary schools is the same as the woke leftists from california [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5251.719999999999s)]
*  Making you know lab-grown meat and they all get kind of jammed together as one [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5257.66s)]
*  Big tribal group and therefore we should ban it all what will likely end up happening here is this will find its path to federal [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5261.259999999999s)]
*  preemption [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5266.759999999999s)]
*  Historically when we've seen states try to impose these sorts of bans [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5268.54s)]
*  The companies that are ultimately affected the innovators that are affected [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5273.339999999999s)]
*  Go to the federal government and they try and legislate for a bill that says this stuff is legal and should be broadly available [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5276.7s)]
*  That federal preemption then stops states rights on having a ban in place [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5282.46s)]
*  And so it's very likely that we'll end up seeing some legislation here over the next couple of years [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5286.86s)]
*  If this technology is ultimately beneficial the problem is now that florida's done this [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5291.0199999999995s)]
*  I guarantee you're going to see texas which is a huge ranching state and many other states step up to do it [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5294.86s)]
*  It creates a really bad precedent for all other disruptive kind of industries to be blocked by their local [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5299.98s)]
*  Economies that that believe that they're under threat and you know, it just creates like a lot of unnecessary chaos [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5305.32s)]
*  So sax what is the santas's beef with fake meat? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5310.86s)]
*  I [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5314.219999999999s)]
*  Don't know. I don't know [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5315.339999999999s)]
*  But let me let me state clearly what I think which is I think it's really terrible [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5318.459999999999s)]
*  when a bunch of incumbents in an industry get together and try to shut out the innovative solution by inventing some [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5323.5s)]
*  Unproven threat that they turn into some sort of about tick tock [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5331.4s)]
*  Right, but exactly but enough about to talk about you see that would come around the corner from a mile away [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5335.58s)]
*  I wanted to talk about this because I think the two are so similar and they're not similar at all. Well, they're not go ahead [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5340.139999999999s)]
*  Regulatory captures regulatory capture, but this is a far. Yeah, that's just a term of art. We're just [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5347.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, we disagree on yeah, that's fair enough [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5352.62s)]
*  I think you guys have to have the intellectual honesty to say these are different issues [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5355.0199999999995s)]
*  One is lab-grown meat versus ranchers in america. This is typical corruption and cronyism fine. Whatever. Okay [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5358.219999999999s)]
*  oh, yeah, but you don't think you don't think that the um, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5365.66s)]
*  The other tech companies that compete with tick tock are secretly banning together to basically gin up this bill [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5368.78s)]
*  I don't think they're secret. I don't think they're secretly banning. I think that they're being over. They're overtly organizing [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5375.5s)]
*  Yeah, just like the ranchers [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5381.18s)]
*  But again that typically still always gets cut on partisan lines [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5383.1s)]
*  And what i'm saying is this is totally different than lab-grown meat versus ranchers [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5387.26s)]
*  I just want to say one thing the intellectual differences and I can acknowledge the similarities [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5391.26s)]
*  I think I just want to make a point here. I think the intellectual discourse on this program [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5396.400000000001s)]
*  Is second to none. I mean we are getting into the most refined details of this issue [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5400.96s)]
*  And you just don't hear this anywhere else. So I just want to give [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5405.68s)]
*  Myself and the rest of the crew pat on the back. You just want to masturbate a little bit. Yeah [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5408.56s)]
*  No, I mean it really did get in a pretty in the weeds here. J. Cal. Do you agree that the florida bill is ridiculous? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5413.28s)]
*  And that it sets a terrible precedent [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5419.52s)]
*  I didn't read it but I [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5422.16s)]
*  Would think that it's exactly what we said. There's nothing special about it. I can't imagine [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5424.48s)]
*  Why somebody would want to ban mock meat other than crony capitalism, of course? [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5429.599999999999s)]
*  And my question to you is when is this going to taste good? When are you going to make this mock meat? [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5434.8s)]
*  well, by the way [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5438.24s)]
*  This bill makes no sense because the only reason they would do it is if they were afraid that the lab-grown meat was just [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5438.8s)]
*  so much cheaper [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5445.2s)]
*  And frankly so much tastier than what they make and freeburg you you've said this many times like we are so [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5446.96s)]
*  Like orders of magnitude away from it. Yeah, we're 10 years out [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5453.679999999999s)]
*  But by the way, why try and stop it from competing? [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5457.84s)]
*  Let the vcs that want to throw money at it throw money at it. Let the scientists pursue it [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5460.48s)]
*  Let the thing let the thing that's made america so successful be successful by the way, imagine [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5464.72s)]
*  Elon got the starship up today. You guys saw this thing. It went into orbit. It was incredible [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5470.639999999999s)]
*  Imagine if boeing and a bunch of defense contractors got together 10 years ago and said we got to stop spacex [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5476.22s)]
*  These guys are trying to do stuff in an unsafe way [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5482.32s)]
*  We don't know and they tried and they tried and they will keep trying [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5484.88s)]
*  And the freedom that we afford people and businesses in the united states of america [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5488.24s)]
*  Is what allows us to have our unique edge and our unique ability to create progress that you don't see anywhere else on planet earth [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5492.72s)]
*  And this is the sort of that takes us backwards. I just you just had the key word we us america [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5499.76s)]
*  America back to the tiktok thing. That's not an us thing. That's a chinese thing [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5505.04s)]
*  I get the point. I'm not like i'm not pro ccp, but yeah, I get the point anything american god bless us [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5509.36s)]
*  Let's go american exceptionalism. No, I saw the headlines. I think cnbc reported that uh, the rocket blew up on entry reentry [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5516.24s)]
*  I mean the I think they didn't say that did they? [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5523.839999999999s)]
*  I saw one headline where they had to put a little nag in the end of the sentence. They were starlink starlink video [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5527.44s)]
*  For like an hour. It's not video was so crystal clear. It was like hd [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5533.04s)]
*  Of this rocket coming back down to earth. It was bonkers. So congrats to e [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5538.48s)]
*  Can I show you guys the most incredible tweet? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5542.24s)]
*  Related to this. Uh, i'm just gonna send this to you nick friendly reminder that google's annual catering budget is 72 million [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5545.919999999999s)]
*  About twice the cost of sharsh [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5553.04s)]
*  Today elon made the entire [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5558.32s)]
*  human race [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5560.799999999999s)]
*  Multi-planetary. Yeah, and it costs half as much as what google spends on food [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5562.459999999999s)]
*  That's incredible [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5569.28s)]
*  It does seem like it doesn't seem like a lot of money to spend on food [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5570.799999999999s)]
*  I don't know. It does seem like these rockets take two or three the new each time [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5573.679999999999s)]
*  There's a new platform. It seems to take you on exactly like two or three to nail it and here we are again [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5577.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, you know, that's a congrats to our boy [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5582.879999999999s)]
*  Great job, uh, this is going back full circle the persistence and the resilience that was needed to get this thing to happen [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5585.44s)]
*  It's just like 20 years of step by step iterative nothing about the initial [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5591.759999999999s)]
*  Kind of instantiation or concept of you know [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5597.92s)]
*  What spacex needed to walk to get here was right everything had to change along the way starlink came along [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5601.12s)]
*  Etc, etc. And here he is at the end of this period of time [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5607.04s)]
*  With this incredible craft the largest object to ever fly in outer space [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5610.72s)]
*  It really is like an incredible moment in human history and it took the degree of persistence resilience [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5615.12s)]
*  That was I think marks what makes american entrepreneurship so powerful. It really is an incredible day [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5620.16s)]
*  It was an amazing thing to watch. I don't know if any of you guys have ever gone watch and watch any of the old [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5625.6s)]
*  Saturn launches on youtube [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5629.92s)]
*  But I think this is a new era. It's really incredible. I think this was like five or six years ago [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5631.92s)]
*  I got cleared to basically [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5637.4400000000005s)]

*  One of the most incredible things i've ever done so I think we made some progress if you look at the google news links [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5651.679999999999s)]
*  A lot of praise for this launch soon [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5658.16s)]

*  Been inside of one of these things but the the starship. Yeah, I've been inside [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5670.4s)]
*  I was inside the first one they built it. It is so large [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5675.12s)]
*  The capacity of this thing is like I think you could fit like three four five hundred human beings inside of it [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5678.8s)]
*  It's not you are our often poker night. We can stop over and see it [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMajFsCkzxY&t=5684.639999999999s)]
