# In conversation with Tucker Carlson, plus OpenAI chaos explained
**All In Podcast:** [December 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E)
*  This is Sax's big day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=0.0s)]
*  There he is. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2.0s)]
*  Oh, there's Tucker. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3.08s)]
*  Oh, look at the smile on Sax's face. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3.92s)]
*  This is the greatest day in the history of the All-In-One. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6.36s)]
*  Look at how happy Sax is. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=9.4s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh, Sax. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=11.4s)]
*  By the way, I'm not ashamed of that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=14.9s)]
*  Look at Sax. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=16.8s)]
*  Come on, I'm honored. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=17.64s)]
*  Oh, whoa, Sax. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=20.72s)]
*  He's getting it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=22.04s)]
*  This heated up quickly. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=23.2s)]
*  How threatened do you feel right now? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=24.68s)]
*  This is the highest rated host in cable history. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  This is the world's true greatest moderator. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=28.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=31.68s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt, no doubt. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=32.08s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=33.08s)]
*  Sax, where is this in relation to your marriage [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  and the birth of your children? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  Don't ask. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=37.36s)]
*  It's right up there. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=38.28s)]
*  Up there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  He's like, what children? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=39.88s)]
*  It is for me. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=40.92s)]
*  All right, everybody, we've got an amazing guest for you today [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=41.56s)]
*  here on the All-In Podcast. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=44.68s)]
*  Sax, his dream has come true. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=47.36s)]
*  Tucker Carlson is with us today. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=49.56s)]
*  You know Tucker, he was the number one TV host for much [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=50.96s)]
*  of the All-In podcast. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  He's the number one TV host for the All-In podcast. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=54.84s)]
*  So it's great to have him here. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  And he's also a great host for the All-In podcast, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=58.160000000000004s)]
*  and I'm sure you'll be excited about it, too, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=60.52s)]
*  because we've got a lot of fun. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=62.52s)]
*  And I'm sure you'll be excited about it, too. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=63.760000000000005s)]
*  We've got a lot of fun, too. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=65.56s)]
*  We've got a lot of fun. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=66.6s)]
*  We've got a lot of fun. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=67.72s)]
*  We've got a lot of fun. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  He's been the number one TV host for much of the past decade, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=69.76s)]
*  including last year, when, shockingly, he was fired [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=73.76s)]
*  from Fox News on April 24th. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Reason for the firing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  It's never been pinned down, but maybe we'll get into it today. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=80.56s)]
*  And we're going to find out what is motivating a post-Fox News [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=83.76s)]
*  Tucker, who has obviously launched a show on X, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=87.56s)]
*  the platform formerly known as Twitter. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  He's done 42 episodes and counting. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=94.36000000000001s)]
*  Everybody from Donald Trump, Andrew Tate, Dave Portnoy, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=97.76s)]
*  and the newly elected president of Argentina on the program. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=101.76s)]
*  So welcome to the All-In podcast, Tucker Carlson. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=106.36s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=111.56s)]
*  It is a legit honor to be here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=112.76s)]
*  Two-part question to kick us off here. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=115.76s)]
*  First, have you figured out why you were fired from Fox? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  And let's get into that a bit. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=121.16s)]
*  And second, given that you were the number one host [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=123.76s)]
*  for much of the past decade, and I think probably in the top five, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=127.56s)]
*  highest paid of all time, what's motivating you now? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=131.56s)]
*  What's the mission here as an independent journalist? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=134.76s)]
*  Take those two questions, whichever order you like. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=137.56s)]
*  I don't know why I was fired. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=139.76s)]
*  I mean, it kind of is an Agatha Christie story. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=141.36s)]
*  There are like so many suspects. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=143.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=144.76s)]
*  But I don't know. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=146.76s)]
*  I was never told I can only speculate. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=147.76s)]
*  There were a lot of different things going on. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=149.56s)]
*  I've had a lot of opinions that were unpopular, you know, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=151.36s)]
*  with people who might have influenced my show getting canceled. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=155.36s)]
*  So I really don't know. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  I will say, you know, right after it happened, people said, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=160.56s)]
*  well, how can they fire the top guy? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=163.96s)]
*  Because that's what it is. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  I'm certainly not the first high rated host to get fired. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=167.96s)]
*  It's not only about ratings. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=171.36s)]
*  There are a lot of different factors. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  It's a big company you all have worked for and run big companies, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=175.16000000000003s)]
*  and you know. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=178.56s)]
*  There's a lot of complicated stuff going on, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=179.56s)]
*  and it's never exactly clear, you know, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=181.36s)]
*  why things happen the way they do. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=184.36s)]
*  But I was not shocked by it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=185.96s)]
*  I mean, I was shocked by it in a short-term sense. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=187.36s)]
*  I didn't expect to have my show canceled that morning. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=189.16s)]
*  But I was not shocked at all when I thought about it for a minute. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=191.36s)]
*  I'd expected that. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=195.96s)]
*  You know, you can't kind of give the finger to everybody [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=197.16s)]
*  and persist in a corporate job. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=201.76s)]
*  So, you know, hard feelings. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=203.96s)]
*  And in fact, I said that on the call when I received the news. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=205.76s)]
*  It's not my company. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  And I never felt like I had a right to be on the air. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=210.56s)]
*  I was working at the pleasure of the family that runs the company, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=213.56s)]
*  who treated me very well, and they wanted me off. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=216.95999999999998s)]
*  And so I was off. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=220.16s)]
*  Did you ever have moments where somebody taps you on the shoulder and says, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=221.56s)]
*  Advertiser XYZ is getting uncomfortable, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=225.56s)]
*  or we're trying to lend this new advertiser, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=228.56s)]
*  and they want you to shape things in one way? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=231.76s)]
*  Did you ever feel that pressure? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=234.16s)]
*  Or is that just a thing that is kind of like a boogeyman [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=235.76s)]
*  that doesn't actually exist? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=238.56s)]
*  Oh, it not only exists, it defines news coverage, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=239.96s)]
*  especially on Pharma. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=242.76s)]
*  You know, because Pharma is the biggest advertiser on television, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=244.76s)]
*  as I know you know, and so for sure. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=246.76s)]
*  I mean, if, you know, Pfizer is sponsoring your show, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=249.16s)]
*  you're not going to question the facts. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=251.56s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of that simple. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=252.56s)]
*  So absolutely. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=254.56s)]
*  And of course, that's why they're the biggest advertisers, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=255.56s)]
*  so they can shape news coverage. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=258.16s)]
*  I mean, that's the point. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=259.36s)]
*  But I personally never had a single person say to me, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=261.16s)]
*  don't say this, that I recall. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=264.56s)]
*  I haven't thought about it too much, but that certainly, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=266.76s)]
*  I was there 14 years, and I didn't have that experience regularly, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=268.36s)]
*  or at all really, that I can remember. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=272.56s)]
*  And I think, you know, my producers may have been told that, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=274.56s)]
*  but it didn't ever get to me because I was always really clear, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=277.76s)]
*  which is, I always said out loud to the supervisors there, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=281.56s)]
*  you know, I work for your company, I don't own this network, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=286.76s)]
*  all I can control is what I say. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=290.36s)]
*  If you don't like what I say, don't have me on TV. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=292.36s)]
*  But as long as I'm on TV, I'm going to say what I think is true. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  And in a million cases, I said only part of what I think, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=298.16s)]
*  not because of my employer, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=301.76000000000005s)]
*  but just because you shouldn't actually say everything you think. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=303.56s)]
*  I mean, I have some crackpot views too, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  or I have resentments that I didn't want to work out on the air. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=307.56s)]
*  I mean, I did, you know, you're restraining yourself and you want to, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=310.36s)]
*  as you do in your personal life. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=312.96000000000004s)]
*  But on no question of principle, did I ever pull back, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=314.36s)]
*  because I just, I wouldn't do that. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=318.16s)]
*  And again, I was just super clear, if you don't like what I'm saying, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=319.76000000000005s)]
*  take me off the air, but I'm not going to, you know, toe a line. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  And because I was so clear about that, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=325.36s)]
*  I just think they didn't think it was worth having some kind of dispute with me. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=326.76s)]
*  And to their great credit, for the time that I was there, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=330.96s)]
*  and I said this many times in public, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=334.56s)]
*  like I took positions on the Ukraine War, on the COVID vaccine, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  on the COVID lockdowns, among other issues that I think, you know, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=339.96s)]
*  I've been vindicated on pretty conclusively on the origins of COVID. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=344.56s)]
*  And all of those are super unpopular. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=348.96s)]
*  On January 6th, which was so hated at the company where I worked, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=350.56s)]
*  that people, a number of people, including on-air people, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=354.96s)]
*  four that I can think of resigned in protest over my, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=357.56s)]
*  over me suggesting that actually it was more complicated than it looked. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=361.56s)]
*  And there were a bunch of federal agents in the crowd. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=364.96s)]
*  How can you say that? Are you claiming a false flag? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=366.76s)]
*  Well, no, not, wouldn't use that phrase, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=369.56s)]
*  but like this is something weird going on here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=371.96s)]
*  Well, I've been vindicated on that. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=373.56s)]
*  It sounds like I'm bragging. I'm not. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=374.96s)]
*  I'm just stating factually that I said things that were truly hated [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=376.56s)]
*  by a lot of the people who worked there, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=381.96s)]
*  and they let me keep saying them. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=383.16s)]
*  So it's kind of hard to complain really at this point, right? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=384.36s)]
*  Again, it's not my company. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  Just from a business standpoint, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=389.96000000000004s)]
*  I think it's weird for a company to fire their top performer [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  and to do so without giving any notes. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=395.36s)]
*  I mean, if any of us had a superstar executive [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=398.76000000000005s)]
*  or a superstar engineer, like a 100X engineer, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  working at one of our companies, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=405.36s)]
*  and like day in and day out, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=407.76000000000005s)]
*  they were, you know, hitting every milestone and crushing it, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=409.76000000000005s)]
*  like if you had a problem with them, you would give them a note. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=413.76s)]
*  You would just like try to say, hey, can we just like, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=415.96s)]
*  so I just think from like a business standpoint, it's so weird. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  It just seems like self-destructive, and I think it was. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=422.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, their ratings really cratered in the wake of making this change. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=424.76s)]
*  Maybe they've come back a little bit, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=429.35999999999996s)]
*  but I don't think it's ever been the same. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=430.56s)]
*  I just think it's a crazy way to operate a business. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  So yeah, it's their right. I mean, they can do whatever they want, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=434.76s)]
*  but I don't understand it as a way of doing business. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=437.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, I don't understand it as a way of living either. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=439.56s)]
*  I mean, you know, everybody in the course of life, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=441.76s)]
*  whether as a parent or an employer or just a friend, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=444.36s)]
*  has to deliver uncomfortable news or disagree with someone that you deal with, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=447.36s)]
*  and you have a moral obligation to explain the disagreement. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=451.15999999999997s)]
*  You can't just, you know, levy the penalty and leave it at that. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=453.76s)]
*  You have to explain why you're doing that, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=456.76s)]
*  and I think that's, it's incumbent on us morally to do that. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=458.36s)]
*  I wasn't that mad about it, actually, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=462.36s)]
*  because I know the rules of that particular business, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=464.96s)]
*  which are really harsh, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=467.76s)]
*  and I've been in it, you know, my whole life, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=469.36s)]
*  and so I've seen a lot of people as talented or more talented than I [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=471.56s)]
*  meet bad ends, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=475.56s)]
*  and it's, you know, for reasons that I thought were not justified, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=477.16s)]
*  and I know them all really well. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=480.36s)]
*  So you work in a business like that, you know what it is, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=482.16s)]
*  you know the black car is going to show up at 3 a.m. and tow to the Lubeonca, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=485.96s)]
*  and that's just what it is. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=489.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? You can't kind of whine about it, you know? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=490.56s)]
*  Well, how much of it was the, you know, this is a family-owned business, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=492.76s)]
*  and the Patriarch obviously pioneered opinion-based, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=498.16s)]
*  you know, journalism slash entertainment commentary, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=503.16s)]
*  and the younger ones maybe were on the other side of the political aisle [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=506.76000000000005s)]
*  and maybe were not as, I don't know, cutthroat, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=510.76000000000005s)]
*  or maybe didn't share the same philosophy of their dad. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  What was your relationship like with the new generation, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=518.36s)]
*  with Rupert, etc., [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=521.36s)]
*  and how much did that play into it, do you think? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=522.96s)]
*  Well, my relationship with the father and son who were directly involved in that company [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=524.76s)]
*  was, from my perspective, very strong, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=530.76s)]
*  and I will say this about the Murdochs. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=533.16s)]
*  They're very polite. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=535.76s)]
*  I mean, they're really kind of very Anglo, almost elaborately polite, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=538.56s)]
*  in a way that I'm not mocking, I'm complimenting, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=542.76s)]
*  and they're not confrontational, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=545.16s)]
*  they're not nasty in the way that they deal with people directly, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=547.76s)]
*  and I prefer that as sort of a way of communicating with people. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=550.96s)]
*  So I got along with them very, very well. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=554.16s)]
*  I always liked them, and they were very nice to me, elaborately nice to me, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=556.56s)]
*  and always gave me assurances of my right to say what I thought was true. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=560.36s)]
*  And so, again, I can only speculate. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=564.9599999999999s)]
*  I will say, though, and you see this with Trump especially, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=566.36s)]
*  I don't think I'm anywhere near as divisive as Trump. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=569.76s)]
*  Obviously, I'm not as powerful as Trump. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=572.16s)]
*  I'm not the figure Trump is. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=573.36s)]
*  But one thing that maybe Trump and I have in common is [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=574.76s)]
*  we're really disliked by a certain set of people, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=576.9599999999999s)]
*  affluent people, highly educated people, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=581.5600000000001s)]
*  people who work at NGOs, government finance, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=584.76s)]
*  really kind of hate a certain brand of politics. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=586.76s)]
*  So it's not being conservative. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=590.16s)]
*  You can be conservative in that sort of, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=591.76s)]
*  I work at Cato or Heritage, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=593.96s)]
*  or we need to get back to free trade or whatever, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=595.5600000000001s)]
*  that kind of thing, the Reaganite foreign policy, that's all fine. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=598.16s)]
*  But if you start asking questions like, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=601.76s)]
*  well, why doesn't our country act in its own interest? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=603.16s)]
*  There's something about that that's uniquely offensive to them, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=605.76s)]
*  to that whole class of people. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=608.76s)]
*  Now, I could not have more contempt or loathing for those people, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=610.56s)]
*  having grown up among them. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  I know how repulsive they are. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=613.9599999999999s)]
*  So their hatred of me, I wear as a badge of honor, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=615.16s)]
*  it actually makes me happy. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=618.9599999999999s)]
*  But it's hard to take. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=620.76s)]
*  I would say, and again, I'm just speculating in my specific case, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=622.76s)]
*  but I know more broadly, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=625.16s)]
*  it's very hard to have lunch at the Four Seasons in Jackson [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=626.76s)]
*  during the winter because there's some private equity wife [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=630.76s)]
*  who's going to scream at you on your way to the men's room [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=633.16s)]
*  because that world hates you. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=634.9599999999999s)]
*  And so if you live in that world [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=637.76s)]
*  and you're employing someone like me, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=639.16s)]
*  you know, you hear about it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=641.56s)]
*  I guess that's my point. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=643.16s)]
*  You hear about it like, what? That guy's a Nazi. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=643.9599999999999s)]
*  What's the deal with that? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=648.9599999999999s)]
*  I want to actually pull this thread. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=649.9599999999999s)]
*  I would love your perspective on the state of American society, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=651.36s)]
*  just less on the political spectrum of Republican versus Democrat. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=654.9599999999999s)]
*  But just just observe for us, Tucker. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=658.56s)]
*  What do you see in American society? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=660.9599999999999s)]
*  Where are we as a society? What has happened? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=662.56s)]
*  What is happening? [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=665.16s)]
*  Well, this isn't an eight hour podcast. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=666.36s)]
*  I could actually give you my very lengthy theories and views on that. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=667.96s)]
*  But I will just say one thing that's I've been thinking about a lot recently. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=672.36s)]
*  I just have been and my college roommate staying at my house. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=675.36s)]
*  And, you know, we're of course, the same age, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=678.76s)]
*  knowing each other our whole adult lives. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=680.96s)]
*  He's been very successful and he lives in a, you know, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=682.5600000000001s)]
*  an enclave of very, very successful people. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=685.5600000000001s)]
*  And and so we're familiar with this culture. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=687.5600000000001s)]
*  And we were talking about American and he's from an immigrant family. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=689.96s)]
*  So he's got a kind of broader perspective. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=692.96s)]
*  I would argue a broader perspective on like America. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  He's 54 as I am. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=697.36s)]
*  And we're talking about how obviously this is not a democracy. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=698.96s)]
*  It's not even a sort of decent facsimile of a democracy. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=702.36s)]
*  It's to call it a democracy is like ridiculous, actually. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=707.16s)]
*  But it's even worse than that. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=710.5600000000001s)]
*  Our politics and not just our politics, but our public conversation [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=712.76s)]
*  reflects the very specific and parochial concerns of a tiny, tiny group of people, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=716.36s)]
*  which is middle aged affluent women [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=722.5600000000001s)]
*  who tend to be very angry and tend to mostly with their husbands, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=726.66s)]
*  but probably for other reasons too, and exercise this like wildly disproportionate power [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=731.06s)]
*  over what we can talk about and think about and the rules that the rest of us live by. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=737.66s)]
*  It's just kind of amazing. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=742.86s)]
*  And he happens to live in Jackson, Wyoming. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=744.06s)]
*  So and I go there, you know, to ski into fish and I have for a very long time. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=746.06s)]
*  And I always say to him, I can't go anymore because I yelled at at lunch [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=750.16s)]
*  over my elk chili or in the lift line or whatever, or at the West Side Market. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=754.66s)]
*  Literally a relative of mine yelled at me while buying bananas in the West Side Market. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=759.86s)]
*  She lives there. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=765.36s)]
*  And I'm thinking, what is it about this group of people that hates me so much when again, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=766.56s)]
*  I know them really well and related in some cases to them. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=772.26s)]
*  So and I'm not quite sure, but I just I see our politics and our concerns, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=774.66s)]
*  which if you take three steps back, are like insanely picky. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=780.66s)]
*  You like trans black lives matter. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=783.86s)]
*  Well, I never said they didn't. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=787.26s)]
*  But like if that's your main public policy objective to celebrate trans black lives in [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=789.06s)]
*  a country of 360 million people, it's got a lot of big problems. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=793.76s)]
*  You are not seeing the whole picture. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=797.4599999999999s)]
*  So like what is that? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=800.66s)]
*  And what it is again is the disproportionate influence of a class of people and their neuroses. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=802.9599999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't even say policy concerns, but like there are things they're worried about and [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=808.5600000000001s)]
*  their weird personal ticks and like the results of years of therapy and SSRIs on their brains. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=811.86s)]
*  Like that kind of controls our whole conversation. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=817.96s)]
*  And my friend was saying, because he's really smart, he's like, yeah, but the good news [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=821.46s)]
*  is this can't last because it's just too stupid. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=825.1s)]
*  And at some point very soon, the country is going to revert to the place that all countries [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=829.0s)]
*  begin, which is in a conversation about things that matter like who comprises the population. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=832.3000000000001s)]
*  Do we have enough water? [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=837.9s)]
*  Where are we on energy exactly? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=839.1s)]
*  How are we going to manage these complex relationships with other countries? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=840.8s)]
*  Like the things that, you know, the stuff of government, the stuff of resources, of [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=843.54s)]
*  course resources, but like just the basic questions that should dominate the consciousness [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=848.6999999999999s)]
*  of any country and should dominate our public conversation. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=853.42s)]
*  It's like our public obsessions are getting increasingly irrelevant, actually. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=856.68s)]
*  Increasingly it's like crazy. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=862.98s)]
*  As our problems get bigger. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=863.98s)]
*  The conversation becomes more inane as the problems get bigger. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=867.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=870.46s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=871.46s)]
*  So when you look at that, that cohorts disproportionate impact, and then you translate it, for example, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=872.46s)]
*  last night there was a, I guess like a almost riot protest when folks were trying to light [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=876.38s)]
*  the Christmas tree and Rockefeller Center, I guess. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=882.0600000000001s)]
*  And there was like a huge pro-Hamas, I think somebody checked me out if this is wrong, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=885.9s)]
*  protest and then people were pushing back on the cops and all of this stuff. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=891.98s)]
*  And all these folks were trying to do was just light the Christmas tree. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=894.82s)]
*  Can you connect the dots? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=898.1s)]
*  How does that get to? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=899.1s)]
*  No, but it's actually a branch from the same tree, Christmas tree in this case, because [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=901.1s)]
*  that whole conversation, well, I think it's interesting and I think it's geopolitically [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=907.5400000000001s)]
*  significant and I've been to those countries and I know people there, so I'm like interested [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=911.38s)]
*  in it. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=916.24s)]
*  And there's a lot to care about and be interested in. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=917.24s)]
*  But the displacement of all of our public passions onto a conflict in a foreign country, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=920.0200000000001s)]
*  however important that conflict may be, really kind of tells you a lot. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=926.62s)]
*  It's like, in other words, yeah, I care what's happening between Israel and Hamas. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=930.98s)]
*  I have views on it, which are probably pretty mainstream views, whatever, I don't have [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=935.6600000000001s)]
*  very interesting views on it. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=939.22s)]
*  But it's a little weird for your entire country thousands of miles away to be so preoccupied [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=940.82s)]
*  with that conflict that they miss big history changing events happening in their own country. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=946.1s)]
*  And I think that's again a species of the same problem. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=952.46s)]
*  We are unable to, the problems they confront us are so big that we can't deal with them. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=955.78s)]
*  And actually my wife and I had this conversation the other night. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=960.5400000000001s)]
*  I was for years a magazine writer and I have to file every Friday. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=962.32s)]
*  I work for Bill Kristol at the Weekly Standard and obviously I regret that, but it was interesting [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=965.62s)]
*  at the time. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=969.82s)]
*  And I have to file the story every week. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=970.82s)]
*  And I'd stay up all night because I'm very lazy and I put stuff off. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=973.26s)]
*  And I'd stay up every Thursday night all night. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=976.0999999999999s)]
*  And I remember a call, it's going to the printing press in Pennsylvania, this was back when [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=978.4599999999999s)]
*  it was in print, and you've got to file it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=982.54s)]
*  And right around 8.30am on Friday morning I would have this overwhelming urge to rearrange [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=985.5799999999999s)]
*  the books on my shelves in my library by title or by subject. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=990.06s)]
*  I'd have all these weird kind of like librarian fantasies about rearranging books, which on [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=994.26s)]
*  a normal day, like why would you do that? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1000.86s)]
*  Better things to do. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1002.58s)]
*  But as my problems mounted and I couldn't write the lead I wanted, I would transfer [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1003.58s)]
*  all my anxiety onto something I felt I could control or that was of lower stakes, less [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1008.94s)]
*  consequence. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1013.54s)]
*  And I think that's kind of what we're seeing a little bit. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1014.66s)]
*  We care more about foreign wars and trans lives as the obvious things that hold our [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1017.46s)]
*  society together start to fall apart. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1023.94s)]
*  How do you even deal with that? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1026.6200000000001s)]
*  I don't know if I'm being very articulate, but I think that's what's happening. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1028.22s)]
*  Makes perfect sense. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1030.8600000000001s)]
*  What do you put on the top of that list of things we should be focused on, Tucker? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1031.8600000000001s)]
*  From my perspective, by far the most... [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1037.34s)]
*  Yeah, if you rank one, two, three, this is what America needs to put its energy on. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1039.06s)]
*  It's not even close. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1042.8600000000001s)]
*  National cohesion, and by which I mean something specific, what does the majority of the country [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1044.66s)]
*  have in common with one another? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1048.9s)]
*  Because look, the arc of the last century, American history is super, super interesting. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1051.06s)]
*  So you have this massive influx of immigration, the Ellis Island generation, late 19th, early [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1056.74s)]
*  20th century. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1067.46s)]
*  And it's both good and bad. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1068.94s)]
*  We only remember the good. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1069.94s)]
*  But there was a lot of social volatility, like a lot. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1070.94s)]
*  Like the mayor of Chicago got shot in his house. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1073.7s)]
*  There was bombings on Wall Street. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1075.3s)]
*  Like the whole, the Wobblies, the anarchists, like the foot soldiers that were immigrants, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1077.02s)]
*  working class European immigrants. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1081.26s)]
*  And part of the problem was there was a lot of immigrants. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1084.6200000000001s)]
*  Sacco and Vanzetti, who shot the clerk in, was it Brockton, Mass? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1087.38s)]
*  Anyway, it was in Mass outside Boston. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1094.14s)]
*  They had been in the country for just a few years, and they immediately got sucked into [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1096.34s)]
*  radical politics. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1099.26s)]
*  Well, why was that? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1100.26s)]
*  Well, because they weren't bought in or rooted in or hadn't been fully assimilated into American [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1101.26s)]
*  society. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1106.02s)]
*  So then you have the First World War, and we basically shut down immigration, and we [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1107.02s)]
*  have this period of settling where like all Americans think through our civic religion, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1109.9s)]
*  what ties us together, and then that leads into October of 29, and you do have this national [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1114.8200000000002s)]
*  crisis that lasts for more than a decade, and we didn't blow up. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1118.94s)]
*  And we had a successful, you know, the CCC, we like had these big programs, which I'll [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1122.5800000000002s)]
*  say this as a conservative, kind of worked in keeping people fed and focused and gave [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1126.8200000000002s)]
*  them purpose, kept the country from collapsing during the Great Depression. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1131.74s)]
*  If that happened now, when there is no broad agreement on what it means to be an American, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1136.46s)]
*  no agreement at all on what we all have in common, I don't think we can withstand it, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1141.1200000000001s)]
*  actually. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1144.82s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1145.82s)]
*  And I'm not even convinced it matters as much what that civic religion is as it does that [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1146.82s)]
*  we have one. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1152.38s)]
*  If we don't have anything that ties us together when that day comes, and you know what I mean [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1153.38s)]
*  when the economic crisis comes, because it's coming, like what's that going to look like? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1159.3s)]
*  It's going to be very scary. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1163.7s)]
*  So that's what I'm most worried about by far. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1166.34s)]
*  How do you define national cohesion, I guess, maybe then? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1168.7s)]
*  Like, what are the few elements that you think America needs to agree on as a majority? [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1171.26s)]
*  Wake me up from a deep sleep and ask me what it means to be an American. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1176.58s)]
*  And then do the same to a thousand other people, and we'll just do a survey on it. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1180.54s)]
*  And do the majority of those people give the same answer? [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1184.38s)]
*  And if they don't, like, so this is, I mean, I have so many theories, God, I'm going to [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1187.98s)]
*  control myself, but I would just say one other thing, which is we overestimate people's [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1193.58s)]
*  ability to metabolize change. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1198.5s)]
*  It's, you know, I'm not like a strict Darwinist or anything, but I do sort of believe that [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1200.6599999999999s)]
*  over time people adapt to their environment and that, you know, in us is, you know, most [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1204.86s)]
*  of our abilities are inborn. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1211.02s)]
*  Like, that's just true. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1212.02s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1213.02s)]
*  I have dogs. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1214.02s)]
*  I know that. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1215.02s)]
*  And people just haven't, you know, the world didn't change that much from, you know, 460 [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1216.02s)]
*  or whatever, the sacking of Rome until the Renaissance. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1221.94s)]
*  It just didn't. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1223.74s)]
*  And then the Industrial Revolution to now has been like such massive change that it's [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1224.94s)]
*  driving people insane. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1228.46s)]
*  People can't handle relentless change. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1229.6599999999999s)]
*  And technologists love relentless change. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1232.26s)]
*  And I like a lot of technologists, a couple of really good friends of mine, but they're [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1234.22s)]
*  anomalies. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1238.06s)]
*  A lot of them are literally autistic. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1239.06s)]
*  I'm not attacking them. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1240.58s)]
*  I'm praising them, but they're different from most people. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1241.58s)]
*  Sax is on the program right now, Tucker. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1243.94s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1245.74s)]
*  You know, like they can handle it. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1246.74s)]
*  They want a world that's totally different from today's world tomorrow. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1249.06s)]
*  They want that. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1252.2199999999998s)]
*  They thrive in that flux. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1253.2199999999998s)]
*  They do. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1254.6599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1255.6599999999999s)]
*  But most people don't. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1256.6599999999999s)]
*  They don't understand how rare they are. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1257.6599999999999s)]
*  And if you impose that on a society and you don't ever have a period where you pause and [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1259.98s)]
*  let things settle, you will blow up that society. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1266.26s)]
*  And the Chinese, who I don't admire for many things at all, know this. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1269.34s)]
*  And I admire that about them. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1273.6599999999999s)]
*  They think that change for its own sake is dangerous. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1275.26s)]
*  Now, they think it's dangerous to their power and they're absolutely right. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1277.66s)]
*  But it's also dangerous just to like the idea of a society. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1279.8200000000002s)]
*  What is a society? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1282.98s)]
*  And so anyway, I can go on and on and on. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1284.66s)]
*  But that's my main concern. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1287.38s)]
*  Let me propose a theory and see if you react to it. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1289.18s)]
*  I think that there's a big orientation in society where it's constantly about trying [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1291.98s)]
*  to shift the power dynamics, that everyone always feels like they don't have something [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1297.5400000000002s)]
*  that someone else has. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1301.98s)]
*  And that other person that has it for some reason is advantaged in a way that to them [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1303.9s)]
*  always feels unfair. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1310.06s)]
*  And everyone feels this way. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1311.62s)]
*  Everyone. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1313.18s)]
*  That's right. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1314.18s)]
*  You're at the top of the food chain. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1315.18s)]
*  You feel like someone else has something you don't have and it's unfair and the system [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1316.18s)]
*  is set up that way no matter where you sit. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1319.46s)]
*  And as a result of that, and by the way, this goes back, I get waxed super philosophical [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1322.1s)]
*  on this stuff, but like Buddhism's always had this point that like the desire that humans [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1327.22s)]
*  have is the one thing that causes all of societal suffering behavior, everything. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1331.28s)]
*  But it all comes down to this. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1336.8s)]
*  It's that you see that someone else has something you desire it and then you want to change [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1337.84s)]
*  the dynamic of how the system, how society is organized to to fix that. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1342.72s)]
*  The thing about technology, if you think back, the catapult gave an advantage to an army [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1347.64s)]
*  that allowed them to win in a war. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1351.96s)]
*  So did the rifle. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1354.28s)]
*  So did the nuclear bomb that ultimately technology was the enabling force that allowed a rapid [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1355.32s)]
*  shift in power dynamics. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1360.84s)]
*  And all technology ultimately creates leverage for the creator of the technology initially [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1362.6s)]
*  and then it diffuses to everyone. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1367.1599999999999s)]
*  But that is perhaps why this is a theory I have, which is that there's generally pessimism [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1369.32s)]
*  towards technology because it creates unfair advantages that shift the power dynamic too [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1375.9199999999998s)]
*  quickly and too advantageously. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1381.8999999999999s)]
*  And it's also why I think you don't hear a lot of support for technology from most of [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1384.6399999999999s)]
*  society because technology creators are such a small percentage of society. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1388.76s)]
*  So I don't know if that that resonates with your point, but for me, it's always been like. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1392.6399999999999s)]
*  I think that's really smart and I think it's indisputably true. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1396.6s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1399.52s)]
*  I will say you're making an argument, in addition to many other things, against tribalism because [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1400.8s)]
*  tribalism accentuates these pre-existing impulses in people, which again, like all impulses [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1407.8799999999999s)]
*  are just inborn. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1414.42s)]
*  Human nature is immutable. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1416.02s)]
*  So let's just start there. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1417.02s)]
*  It cannot be changed. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1418.8600000000001s)]
*  AI will not change human nature. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1419.8600000000001s)]
*  It will change everything but human nature. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1420.8600000000001s)]
*  And envy and the fact that prosperity is a relative measure above starvation. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1423.74s)]
*  So it's like there's a famous Russian proverb like, you know, I've got a cow, my neighbor [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1433.74s)]
*  has a cow, he gets a cow, now he has two cows, I kill his cow. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1438.1000000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1443.46s)]
*  It's just, right. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1444.54s)]
*  So, but tribalism, especially in a country like ours, which as noted doesn't have a working [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1445.54s)]
*  majority of people with obvious connection to each other, it really, really exacerbates [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1452.46s)]
*  that a lot. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1459.3600000000001s)]
*  And because it makes it more obvious. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1461.3400000000001s)]
*  So all of a sudden it's not just like, hey, the smart kids are richer, they have two cows. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1463.3s)]
*  It's like the Jews are richer or the Indians are richer or the whites are richer or whatever. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1467.9s)]
*  You know, it's like just name the group. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1472.22s)]
*  And that once you go down that road, you know, it's it that that leads to violence and mass [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1474.5800000000002s)]
*  violence actually. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1480.66s)]
*  A lot of people listening right now, Tucker, are probably a little bit confused hearing [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1481.98s)]
*  you talk about cohesion of the country when most people would look at, you know, the tribalism [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1486.9s)]
*  as almost most manifested in cable news. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1492.6200000000001s)]
*  You and Rachel Maddow every night were, you know, number one and number two in the ratings [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1497.02s)]
*  taking either side of the tribe. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1500.54s)]
*  So is this something that's evolved? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1502.22s)]
*  And how did your time in cable news inform you to this? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1504.18s)]
*  Because most people would say, like, wait, isn't Tucker and Rachel like, isn't that aren't [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1508.18s)]
*  those the two tribe leaders? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1512.26s)]
*  I think I think there are dumb people who think that. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1514.6200000000001s)]
*  But no, here's the difference. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1517.02s)]
*  My views. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1518.54s)]
*  Wait, I'm sorry about me. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1519.54s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm not including you in that. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1520.54s)]
*  I'm not including you. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1521.54s)]
*  I know I'm not including you. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1522.54s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1523.54s)]
*  If the shoe fits. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1524.54s)]
*  I'm asking you on behalf of the audience. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1525.54s)]
*  It's all good. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1526.6399999999999s)]
*  It's all good, Tucker. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1527.6399999999999s)]
*  Why should you be any different than the other panelists? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1528.6399999999999s)]
*  No, I love and not only do I love, I don't always love, but I certainly think that reason [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1533.6399999999999s)]
*  disagreement is essential. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1538.1s)]
*  It's the alternative to violence, by the way. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1539.86s)]
*  That's what that is. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1542.12s)]
*  Debate and politics are the alternative violence. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1543.12s)]
*  You get two choices. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1545.3799999999999s)]
*  We're going to do it by arguing about it. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1546.3799999999999s)]
*  We're going to do it by force. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1548.58s)]
*  OK, so that's different. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1549.58s)]
*  I know you're going to do it by force. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1550.58s)]
*  I know you're going to do it by force. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1551.58s)]
*  I know you're going to do it by force. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1552.58s)]
*  I know you're going to do it by force. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1553.58s)]
*  about it or we're going to do it by force. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1554.62s)]
*  Okay, so I absolutely think it's essential to debate things [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1556.2199999999998s)]
*  because if we don't, then we just have to shoot each other [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1560.34s)]
*  and I'm against that. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1562.3799999999999s)]
*  But that's very different from tribalism [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1563.6599999999999s)]
*  because tribalism is based on things that you can't change. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1567.8999999999999s)]
*  So for example, in 2002, I hosted a show on CNN [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1572.1999999999998s)]
*  and it was the run up to the war in Iraq. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1576.34s)]
*  I was uncomfortable with the idea [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1578.4599999999998s)]
*  that we would be invading Iraq to respond to an attack [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1579.8s)]
*  on America that had nothing to do with Iraq. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1583.12s)]
*  I did think that didn't make sense, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1584.78s)]
*  but I was sold on the idea finally by someone [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1586.1599999999999s)]
*  and I foolishly parroted the Bush administration's line [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1589.28s)]
*  on that. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1592.8s)]
*  So I was a pro-war person for a time. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1593.6399999999999s)]
*  Then I went to Iraq and I changed my views completely. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1595.8799999999999s)]
*  So I switched sides completely and I wound up [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1599.04s)]
*  on the other side, anti-war in Iraq. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1601.1999999999998s)]
*  And that took about a week. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1603.4799999999998s)]
*  I was born a white man. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1606.3999999999999s)]
*  You were born whatever you are, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1609.04s)]
*  everyone's born whatever they are. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1610.0s)]
*  That can't change. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1611.06s)]
*  So if we stoke division along lines that can't be changed, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1612.16s)]
*  then we're really at a cul-de-sac. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1617.72s)]
*  Our differences can never be resolved. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1619.48s)]
*  You will always be what you are. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1621.44s)]
*  You can't change it. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1622.76s)]
*  And the same for me. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1624.3600000000001s)]
*  And so those are the things that wind up [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1625.72s)]
*  becoming generational conflicts, civil wars, Rwanda. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1627.9s)]
*  And so I've always been against that my entire life [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1632.8000000000002s)]
*  and my entire time on Fox. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1635.24s)]
*  I argued against that. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1636.52s)]
*  I think affirmative action is completely not only immoral [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1637.46s)]
*  because it's an insult to the idea of America, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1640.12s)]
*  which is like the people who do the best get the most. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1642.3999999999999s)]
*  But it is also a recipe over time for violence. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1645.8s)]
*  And I made that case, I've made that case every single day, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1651.1s)]
*  you know, since David and I had lunch 30 years ago. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1655.1999999999998s)]
*  I've never not thought that. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1658.0s)]
*  I've always had the Dr. Seuss view of race relations, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1659.0s)]
*  which is we should de-emphasize race and elevate, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1662.4199999999998s)]
*  you know, merit, achievement, hard work, character, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1667.12s)]
*  the things that we can control. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1670.3999999999999s)]
*  And, but the other side has gone, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1672.24s)]
*  by the way, liberals used to agree with me, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1675.24s)]
*  that used to be a liberal position within my lifetime. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1676.48s)]
*  And then all of a sudden it became a Nazi position. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1679.52s)]
*  And, you know, that's just a manipulation of language. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1682.28s)]
*  But the truth is, on the race stuff, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1685.32s)]
*  which is what matters over time, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1687.6399999999999s)]
*  if you convince people to hate others [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1689.12s)]
*  on the basis of their race, you've committed a massive sin [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1690.82s)]
*  and you've done a lot to wreck our country, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1693.12s)]
*  that's coming from the left. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1694.92s)]
*  I'm sorry, that's just true. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1696.16s)]
*  This is to connect these ideas. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1697.3200000000002s)]
*  I think that is a major source of our division, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1698.3200000000002s)]
*  is one of the reasons why people have a hard time saying [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1701.3600000000001s)]
*  what it means to be an American [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1704.8400000000001s)]
*  is because there are dueling visions [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1706.0800000000002s)]
*  of what it means to be an American. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1708.24s)]
*  The left has been trying to change [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1710.5600000000002s)]
*  or rewrite American history. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1712.2s)]
*  So for example, the key year in American history, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1713.72s)]
*  the founding of the nation was not 1776 [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1716.96s)]
*  with the Declaration of Independence, it was 1619, right? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1719.8400000000001s)]
*  This is the base of the whole 1619 project [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1723.1200000000001s)]
*  to the New York Times is that the founding of the nation [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1725.6s)]
*  began with the importation of slavery to the New World. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1728.04s)]
*  That was the key year. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1730.9199999999998s)]
*  And so I think there's been an effort for a long time [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1732.8799999999999s)]
*  on the part of the left to rewrite [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1735.28s)]
*  what it means to be an American [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1737.1999999999998s)]
*  and to rewrite American history. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1738.24s)]
*  It's actually in a weird way, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1740.76s)]
*  it's the opposite of what Deng Xiaoping did in China [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1742.4399999999998s)]
*  where Deng basically, he flipped the doctrine over there [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1744.8s)]
*  from communism to capitalism. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1749.6799999999998s)]
*  He didn't outright declare it. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1751.1999999999998s)]
*  He said that, it doesn't matter whether a cat is white or black [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1752.96s)]
*  as long as it catches mice. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1756.96s)]
*  And they didn't change the name, they didn't change the party. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1758.72s)]
*  It's still the Chinese Communist Party, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1761.88s)]
*  they didn't change the flag. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1763.1200000000001s)]
*  But he did a hot swap of the back end to capitalism. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1764.52s)]
*  And they changed what the country was about [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1768.16s)]
*  in that economically. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1771.0s)]
*  It worked out great for them. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1773.04s)]
*  I think in a similar way in the United States, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1774.04s)]
*  they haven't changed the flag, they haven't changed the name. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1776.48s)]
*  But there is an attempt to hot swap the back end [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1778.8400000000001s)]
*  of what it means to be an American. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1781.48s)]
*  And I think this is the root of the conflict. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1783.8s)]
*  I mean, I agree with that completely. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1785.96s)]
*  And I don't think we've thought through [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1787.92s)]
*  what it means to change, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1789.96s)]
*  out of many one to out of one many. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1793.2s)]
*  I think that's, we've set ourselves up [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1797.2s)]
*  for something really, really scary, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1800.76s)]
*  again, for violent conflict. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1802.48s)]
*  Because I don't see how that resolves itself. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1804.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, wise people understand this. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1807.48s)]
*  In a diverse society, pluralistic society, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1810.44s)]
*  whatever you call it, a society where you've got [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1812.72s)]
*  a lot of different people with a lot of different backgrounds [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1814.44s)]
*  and shades and religions and all that stuff, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1816.28s)]
*  you need to de-emphasize the things [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1818.0800000000002s)]
*  that divide us inherently, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1821.28s)]
*  and emphasize the things that unite us. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1823.6000000000001s)]
*  That's not hard. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1826.04s)]
*  And it's also so obvious that if you're not doing it, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1827.0800000000002s)]
*  my first question is, why are you not doing that? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1830.28s)]
*  I mean, why are you not? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1832.28s)]
*  And that kind of explains the true loathing [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1833.32s)]
*  that I have for the people in charge on both sides. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1836.48s)]
*  Because like, if you did that in your household [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1839.52s)]
*  with your children, your kids would be in rehab [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1842.2s)]
*  or jail or dead. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1845.72s)]
*  It's that obvious. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1847.24s)]
*  Like you would never do that to your kids. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1848.08s)]
*  So why would you do that to your population? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1850.0s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1852.28s)]
*  Freeberg, you had a question? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1853.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, where does responsibility lie there, Tucker? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1854.1200000000001s)]
*  What's the mechanism for doing that? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1856.2s)]
*  Because we often, and I find in conversations, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1857.96s)]
*  everyone says the government should. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1862.44s)]
*  And I often question why the government should anything [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1864.88s)]
*  in my life, in my social settings, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1868.8400000000001s)]
*  in how I live, how I do business. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1873.2s)]
*  Does the government, the federal government [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1877.3600000000001s)]
*  in the United States have a role and responsibility [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1880.0s)]
*  to do what you're suggesting we need to do [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1882.16s)]
*  in the United States? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1885.4s)]
*  Or is it the media, or is it social leaders, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1886.96s)]
*  or is it business leaders, or is it local governments? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1891.64s)]
*  Who is responsible ultimately [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1895.6000000000001s)]
*  for creating the social cohesion necessary [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1897.3600000000001s)]
*  for the US to enter a new era of prosperity? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1900.0400000000002s)]
*  And why is that the right group to be responsible? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1903.2800000000002s)]
*  Well, look, I would say, well, it's a great question. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1907.2s)]
*  And I would say new era of prosperity. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1911.64s)]
*  I don't think that's really the goal. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1914.1200000000001s)]
*  We have prosperity. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1915.8400000000001s)]
*  And I think it's a real question as to whether people want [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1917.76s)]
*  Social cohesion. Social cohesion, right. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1919.3600000000001s)]
*  But do people want, I mean, I think there's actually [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1920.8s)]
*  a lot of evidence that human beings sort of hate [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1922.4s)]
*  prosperity, actually. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1925.28s)]
*  We're not designed to be prosperous. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1926.6s)]
*  And the second we are, we invent climate crises [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1928.64s)]
*  to make us less prosperous. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1931.24s)]
*  I mean, that's really what that is, right? [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1933.64s)]
*  But anyway, leaving that aside, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1935.16s)]
*  it's incumbent on all of us, anyone with authority, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1938.8799999999999s)]
*  anyone with a voice, anyone with money. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1941.2s)]
*  And it's really kind of as simple, and I do think, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1943.2s)]
*  you know, government is kind of the last to fall in line. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1946.12s)]
*  It's really as simple as making things [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1949.68s)]
*  socially unacceptable. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1951.44s)]
*  We certainly, I grew up in a world where people [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1952.28s)]
*  smoked on airplanes, okay? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1953.72s)]
*  Now that was banned by the FAA, but it was also [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1955.68s)]
*  made totally socially unacceptable. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1959.96s)]
*  You couldn't light a cigarette in someone's kitchen. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1961.6000000000001s)]
*  You just wouldn't think to do that. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1963.56s)]
*  In the same way that you wouldn't think to give [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1964.68s)]
*  the middle finger to an old lady, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1966.64s)]
*  which is not actually illegal, but nobody would do that [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1968.72s)]
*  because it's so appalling in the minds of everybody [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1971.2s)]
*  and everyone's happy to say, what the hell are you doing? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1973.68s)]
*  And I feel the same way about the race stuff. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1976.28s)]
*  It's like, oh, you know, race this, race that. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1978.32s)]
*  Someone should say, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1981.6799999999998s)]
*  Stop that. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1983.72s)]
*  There's part of what you're saying, which I think is, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1984.56s)]
*  which I really agree with, which is this idea that [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1987.6s)]
*  we have gone as the human race, okay, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1990.0s)]
*  from having to make major adaptations over the arc [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1993.04s)]
*  of our evolution as a species, to now, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1996.6399999999999s)]
*  what you're kind of saying is we're now dealing with [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=1999.6399999999999s)]
*  all these minor adaptations and it kind of breaks [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2001.4399999999998s)]
*  the entire circuitry of the brain, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2003.8799999999999s)]
*  which is like before we had to fight to evade the animals, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2006.48s)]
*  to feed ourselves, to build the machine, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2009.24s)]
*  to all of a sudden go from an agrarian to an industrial. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2011.96s)]
*  These were huge adaptations. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2014.52s)]
*  And now we have all of this almost surplus and excess. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2017.76s)]
*  And it's a little bit of a head scratcher [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2021.88s)]
*  for a lot of people because now all the adaptations [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2023.76s)]
*  that are left are very minor in shape [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2026.48s)]
*  because all of these other things that would either [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2028.2s)]
*  occupy your time, sustenance, survival, resiliency, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2030.52s)]
*  are taken off the table. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2034.1200000000001s)]
*  I get that. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2035.4s)]
*  The other part of what you say, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2036.6000000000001s)]
*  which is very René Girard, which is like, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2038.3600000000001s)]
*  hey, there's all this copying of people and desire. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2040.48s)]
*  There's going to be violence if we don't figure out [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2044.4s)]
*  how to de-charge it. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2047.0800000000002s)]
*  What do you think we need to do [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2052.44s)]
*  in order to do that discharge? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2055.4s)]
*  How do you get these people to stop focusing [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2057.2000000000003s)]
*  on the small order bits? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2060.32s)]
*  And how do we reorganize people to focus [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2062.68s)]
*  on the big order bits so that we minimize [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2065.44s)]
*  this risk of violence? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2068.3199999999997s)]
*  We minimize the one group of immutable traits [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2069.44s)]
*  fighting another group of immutable traits? [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2073.3599999999997s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2075.3999999999996s)]
*  Do you think? [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2076.24s)]
*  You know, I'm pretty pessimistic about a country this big. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2077.08s)]
*  We say the country. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2082.64s)]
*  I mean, when I talk about the country, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2083.52s)]
*  I'm talking about people I know or grew up with [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2084.96s)]
*  or people who speak my language. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2087.0s)]
*  I mean, the country is so big that something [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2088.44s)]
*  can happen in New Mexico, something big can happen [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2090.64s)]
*  in New Mexico or San Francisco for that matter. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2092.72s)]
*  And like, people don't even know. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2094.44s)]
*  But in general, I would say, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2096.4s)]
*  it's hard to see change in course before we're forced to. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2100.72s)]
*  And so I do think- [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2105.2799999999997s)]
*  You think basically there has to be a moment [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2107.2799999999997s)]
*  of something that's so egregious [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2109.52s)]
*  that causes a national reconciliation of some kind. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2112.7599999999998s)]
*  Essentially that says, hold on a second. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2115.7599999999998s)]
*  You wanna know what I really think, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2117.12s)]
*  which is like kind of crackpot, but I know that it's right. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2119.0s)]
*  I do think the problem is prosperity. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2122.2s)]
*  And I've noticed this as a middle-aged man, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2125.44s)]
*  as I've gotten older and I know people [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2127.48s)]
*  who've been successful, in some cases very successful. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2129.32s)]
*  And I've noticed that when they succeed, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2132.72s)]
*  when they get everything they want, they destroy themselves. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2135.2s)]
*  I've noticed this again and again and again. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2137.68s)]
*  You are the dog who caught the car. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2140.08s)]
*  And actually it's more than just having idle time. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2141.72s)]
*  There's a metaphysical quality. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2144.84s)]
*  There are factors here that I don't understand [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2147.2799999999997s)]
*  that are deeper actually, but I just notice it. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2149.3999999999996s)]
*  There's something about affluence [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2153.04s)]
*  that over time convinces people to kill themselves. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2156.7999999999997s)]
*  And you see it like in a literal sense [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2160.9199999999996s)]
*  in the euthanasia numbers out of Canada [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2163.4799999999996s)]
*  and out of Western Europe. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2165.72s)]
*  You see in a literal sense when you look at [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2167.7999999999997s)]
*  the incidence of diabetes as correlated to GDP. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2169.64s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2172.16s)]
*  It's exactly right. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2173.0s)]
*  You look at these emerging economies and as GDP cranks, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2173.8399999999997s)]
*  the first thing that happens is heart disease cranks up [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2176.48s)]
*  and diabetes cranks up because to your point, Tucker, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2179.12s)]
*  they start to enjoy the prosperity of their earned life. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2181.28s)]
*  But they're not enjoying it. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2185.84s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2186.96s)]
*  The other thing you see is they stop having children, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2187.8s)]
*  which is a form of suicide. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2190.64s)]
*  You're not reproducing. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2191.68s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2193.32s)]
*  There's no other culture who has left a written record [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2194.16s)]
*  in history that didn't see having children [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2197.04s)]
*  as like the primary, first of all, [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2199.52s)]
*  the primary source of wealth and not just [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2201.32s)]
*  because they worked on your farm, but because they exist [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2202.6s)]
*  and so do your genes. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2205.44s)]
*  So if you start to see every, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2207.92s)]
*  it's not just a matter of culture. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2209.92s)]
*  It happens in non-Christian Japan. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2211.68s)]
*  It happens in post-Christian Spain. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2214.3199999999997s)]
*  It happens in South Korea with a 0.7 replacement, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2216.16s)]
*  you know, reproduction rate, 0.7. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2221.3999999999996s)]
*  So what is that? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2224.72s)]
*  And again, it's the same thing. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2226.8399999999997s)]
*  It's that affluence kills you. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2228.52s)]
*  And if you don't believe it, fast for three days. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2231.3199999999997s)]
*  Fasting, by the way, is a feature not just of, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2233.88s)]
*  you know, Christian history. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2236.12s)]
*  Every religion and every culture that I'm aware of [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2237.4s)]
*  has acknowledged fasting as an important religious ritual. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2242.44s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2245.4s)]
*  Why would foregoing food be so important? [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2246.36s)]
*  Well, try it for three days and experience, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2249.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, you're quivering like a tuning fork. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2252.52s)]
*  You know, your sensitivity just explodes. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2254.92s)]
*  There's something about eating too much, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2256.6400000000003s)]
*  literally satisfying the most basic need of all, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2258.08s)]
*  which is for calories. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2261.1600000000003s)]
*  There's something about that that kills you. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2262.44s)]
*  And there's something about foregoing it [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2264.52s)]
*  that enlightens you. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2266.88s)]
*  It's like super interesting. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2267.7200000000003s)]
*  So I, look, there's so much I don't know. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2268.84s)]
*  I'm the last person you wanna listen to. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2271.2400000000002s)]
*  These are deeper waters that I'm qualified to wade in. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2272.48s)]
*  But my senses tell me very, very strongly [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2274.88s)]
*  that the core problem is having too much. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2277.68s)]
*  And I'm not calling for taking things away. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2280.04s)]
*  I think the global warming bullshit is bullshit, okay? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2282.12s)]
*  I mean, obviously it is. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2284.96s)]
*  Climate crisis. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2286.28s)]
*  It's propaganda, but it's coming out of, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2287.64s)]
*  it's also sincere to some extent. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2289.64s)]
*  It's not just a power grab by Davos. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2291.16s)]
*  It's more than that. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2293.6s)]
*  It's people's gut level sense [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2294.52s)]
*  that we need to have less because this is killing us. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2297.16s)]
*  And that is real. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2299.68s)]
*  Freyberg is Tucker said global warming is bullshit is- [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2301.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm just gonna pull up an image for him. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2304.96s)]
*  I just want his reaction to it. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2306.3199999999997s)]
*  Freyberg, you just said that to the consultant of science. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2308.3999999999996s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2311.0s)]
*  No, no, but Tucker has- [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2312.08s)]
*  Let's open this up, yeah. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2313.08s)]
*  No, no, I think it's like just on that topic, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2314.08s)]
*  you know, data shows temperatures are getting warmer [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2317.44s)]
*  off of a baseline of 500 years and now things get warmer. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2320.12s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, I'm so sorry. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2322.64s)]
*  Can I just make a small correction? [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2324.04s)]
*  No, I'm not saying it's not getting warmer. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2325.92s)]
*  It seems to be getting warmer. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2327.56s)]
*  I'm really saying this whole elaborate theory [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2328.8399999999997s)]
*  that humans are causing this rise in temperatures [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2331.68s)]
*  and we know how to reverse it through say, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2334.8399999999997s)]
*  shutting down, you know, the use of hydrocarbons. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2337.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, and even if that were true, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2341.12s)]
*  what we're doing to affect those changes [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2343.92s)]
*  shows how fraudulent the whole thing is. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2346.0s)]
*  I mean, you know the whole arguments, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2347.7599999999998s)]
*  but I'm not actually calling it a question that's changing. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2349.32s)]
*  Temperatures always change. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2351.2000000000003s)]
*  I live in Maine, which was shaped by the glaciers [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2352.44s)]
*  10,000 years ago, so like, yeah, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2354.6000000000004s)]
*  we've had some climate change. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2355.84s)]
*  Do you think that human civilization is not threatened [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2357.36s)]
*  by the changing climate? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2360.0800000000004s)]
*  I just, this is a quick little point, but- [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2361.0800000000004s)]
*  Do I think, well, sure, I mean, it's threatened in some ways, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2363.7200000000003s)]
*  probably help in other ways. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2366.6000000000004s)]
*  I personally hate hot weather, so, you know, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2367.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't care for it. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2370.76s)]
*  I think there's quite a bit of evidence that previous, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2371.76s)]
*  that actually temperature changes can be much more radical [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2375.28s)]
*  than we think, and I'll just give you one example [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2379.0s)]
*  that no one's ever explained, but you're aware [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2380.88s)]
*  that there are all these woolly mammoths found in Kastanis [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2382.92s)]
*  in Siberia and the Soviet, you know, early Soviet, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2385.96s)]
*  1920s expedition to map all of Russia found these things, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2388.92s)]
*  and at least one stranded expedition ate them, okay? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2392.88s)]
*  They ate the woolly mammoth, because it had been frozen [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2395.96s)]
*  so thoroughly that after thousands of years, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2399.24s)]
*  the meat was still edible. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2401.72s)]
*  Well, the question is, like, how did that happen? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2403.16s)]
*  And I think it was the guy who ran Bird's Eye frozen food, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2405.48s)]
*  he was an expert on freezing meat, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2407.76s)]
*  it's like, wait a second, that weighs X thousand pounds, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2409.1200000000003s)]
*  it would have to be frozen extremely quickly, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2412.1600000000003s)]
*  and I know this from hunting too, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2415.36s)]
*  you have to freeze meat very fast to keep it from spoiling. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2417.2000000000003s)]
*  From the bacteria. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2421.36s)]
*  So how did that happen? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2422.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, no, no, for real though, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2423.0400000000004s)]
*  because it decomposes very, a big animal, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2424.32s)]
*  if you shoot, say, a moose, or a big deer, or a mule deer, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2426.48s)]
*  you have to open it up immediately, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2430.0400000000004s)]
*  or the meat will spoil, because the bigger it is, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2432.28s)]
*  the more heat it generates, right? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2434.76s)]
*  We know that, it's like, okay. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2436.0400000000004s)]
*  So how exactly did hundreds or thousands of large animals [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2438.52s)]
*  get frozen so quickly that the meat is still edible [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2442.2s)]
*  thousands of years later? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2444.52s)]
*  That's an honest question that no one's ever answered. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2445.52s)]
*  And the only potential, or even plausible answer, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2447.3199999999997s)]
*  is temperature changed so fast, it flash froze them. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2450.2s)]
*  Well, how did that happen? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2454.72s)]
*  Like, what? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2455.68s)]
*  No, these are sincere questions. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2456.6s)]
*  And so temperature- [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2458.96s)]
*  I'll look into it, I'll get back to you, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2460.08s)]
*  I've not heard about this flash frozen food. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2461.16s)]
*  No, no, but like, what is that? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2462.72s)]
*  Flash frozen food, that's interesting. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2463.56s)]
*  No, I mean- [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2465.16s)]
*  It reminds me of that Marlon Brando film, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2466.0s)]
*  you remember where he goes to an island [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2467.96s)]
*  and eats the super rare food, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2469.52s)]
*  it's like a Komodo dragon or something? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2471.48s)]
*  The graduates, Matthew Broderick's in it, so good. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2473.48s)]
*  It's like the expedition to Siberia [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2476.16s)]
*  to eat the flash frozen wooly mammoths [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2478.04s)]
*  to make a good sequel. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2480.52s)]
*  But it's interesting, I'm gonna look into it. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2481.88s)]
*  I don't know the answer to how and why the wooly mammoths- [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2483.2s)]
*  But the point is, the climate, here's the point, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2485.24s)]
*  that we have physical evidence that the climate on Earth [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2488.24s)]
*  within, you know, inside our atmosphere, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2491.32s)]
*  has changed dramatically, so dramatically, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2492.56s)]
*  that it would kill every person who was affected by it, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2495.68s)]
*  like a number of times, that we know of, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2499.2799999999997s)]
*  over the course of the history of the Earth. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2502.24s)]
*  So like, I mean, I think we could be in [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2504.3599999999997s)]
*  for actual climate change that killed everybody, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2507.7599999999998s)]
*  that's entirely possible. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2510.08s)]
*  But the idea that it's the fault of the United States [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2511.56s)]
*  because of, you know, you drive an F-150 is like so absurd, [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2513.96s)]
*  it's like hard to believe anyone takes that seriously, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2517.8399999999997s)]
*  there's like no evidence of that actually, sorry. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2519.6s)]
*  Yeah, I'm generally just an, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2521.64s)]
*  I'm an optimist about solutions anyway, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2523.16s)]
*  but you know, I think human ingenuity has always prevailed, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2525.04s)]
*  so all this pessimism and catastrophizing, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2528.44s)]
*  I do disagree with respect to like, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2533.2799999999997s)]
*  there is science that indicates that there are elements [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2535.72s)]
*  that were kind of affecting things in an adverse way, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2537.68s)]
*  the challenging way, but I'm not concerned [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2540.92s)]
*  about the challenges just because [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2542.8s)]
*  of where human technology sits and the things we can do. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2544.6s)]
*  So I'm, I have a slightly different point of view, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2546.8s)]
*  but I hear you on it. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2549.36s)]
*  I don't wanna debate the point. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2551.44s)]
*  Sorry, Chamath, go ahead. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2553.32s)]
*  That's a whole nother thing. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2554.16s)]
*  Yeah, I just wanna uplevel this back to something, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2555.24s)]
*  because I think if I had to summarize what you're saying is, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2557.2s)]
*  you're saying Chamath, our society is too prosperous, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2559.64s)]
*  and as a result, that prosperity creates [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2562.56s)]
*  small fringe issues that dominate, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2565.7999999999997s)]
*  which then creates an inability for us to be cohesive. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2568.56s)]
*  So then if we have something that allows us [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2571.16s)]
*  to be forced to be more resilient, [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2574.08s)]
*  we will actually wake up from this fever and say, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2577.0s)]
*  hold on guys, what are the big issues? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2579.44s)]
*  Let's really figure out what matters, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2581.68s)]
*  let's get organized and let's go after those. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2583.08s)]
*  And that both is a healing of the country, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2585.48s)]
*  but it's almost like our insurance policy. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2587.7599999999998s)]
*  Is that kind of a, is that a fair summary? [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2589.84s)]
*  Okay, if I had to put what you're saying in a box or is that? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2592.88s)]
*  Well, I would hate ever to seem like [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2594.8s)]
*  I'm looking forward to catastrophe because I'm not, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2597.64s)]
*  and I hope it doesn't unfold that way. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2601.36s)]
*  No, no, no, I don't think you're saying that. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2603.36s)]
*  No, I mean, I used to drink too much, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2605.88s)]
*  and I know a lot of people used to drink too much, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2607.36s)]
*  and use drugs or whatever, [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2609.08s)]
*  and some of them didn't get better till they went to jail. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2610.72s)]
*  As people who drink too much tend to do over time, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2613.84s)]
*  that never happened to me, and I'm so grateful for it. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2615.08s)]
*  You don't need to get to the bottom. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2617.44s)]
*  You don't, I don't think that you do. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2620.84s)]
*  I'm just really worried [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2622.28s)]
*  that we're not even having a conversation about this. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2624.4s)]
*  But I, again, would point to it a second ago, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2626.12s)]
*  but there's something metaphysical here, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2628.7200000000003s)]
*  there's something deeper than just the search for advantage, [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2630.04s)]
*  which is a big motivator among people, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2635.44s)]
*  but there's something more than that going on. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2637.44s)]
*  Why are we intentionally wrecking the society? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2639.84s)]
*  And we are. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2644.6400000000003s)]
*  And I hear people say, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2645.7200000000003s)]
*  well, it's because some people are getting paid, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2647.32s)]
*  and yeah, it's not really an adequate answer. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2649.6400000000003s)]
*  It's more than that. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2651.96s)]
*  There's something going on. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2652.8s)]
*  Like, instinctively, people wanna, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2653.6400000000003s)]
*  some people want to tear it all down. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2656.1600000000003s)]
*  And I don't think it's necessarily [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2659.96s)]
*  so they can rebuild it to their own advantage. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2660.96s)]
*  I think like destruction is the point. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2663.0800000000004s)]
*  And I just watch carefully, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2665.44s)]
*  and I don't really know what's going on here, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2666.8s)]
*  but something much deeper [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2668.36s)]
*  than what we're acknowledging is going on here. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2670.36s)]
*  Well, I think it comes back to this point about, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2672.2400000000002s)]
*  I can't get what these other people have, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2674.1600000000003s)]
*  and there's now an insurmountable barrier [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2676.0s)]
*  that I cannot ever get there. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2678.6s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2680.52s)]
*  I mean, that doesn't explain why, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2681.52s)]
*  but hold on, that doesn't explain why, for example, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2683.1600000000003s)]
*  Dustin Moskovitz is supporting revolutionary politics [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2686.28s)]
*  and Chesapeake and BLM. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2689.6800000000003s)]
*  I think it's a good example, Sax. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2691.7200000000003s)]
*  I think it does. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2693.0s)]
*  When you have massive abundance, [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2693.84s)]
*  to Shemot's point about the idle mind, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2695.1200000000003s)]
*  Dustin Moskovitz has achieved more [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2698.16s)]
*  than any human could achieve, billions of dollars, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2700.6s)]
*  and now he's got this surplus. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2703.04s)]
*  And then whatever, to Tucker's point, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2704.92s)]
*  whatever he's dealing with personally [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2708.0s)]
*  now becomes this canvas under which [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2709.64s)]
*  he's going to deploy that wealth in an outsourced way. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2712.6s)]
*  I think it actually does explain it. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2714.8399999999997s)]
*  It fits more with luxury beliefs [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2716.3199999999997s)]
*  than with the idea that scarcity or envy [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2718.7599999999998s)]
*  is somehow driving it. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2721.96s)]
*  Yeah, but yes, so those are luxury beliefs, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2723.3199999999997s)]
*  and he's got a huge bankroll. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2725.68s)]
*  Therefore, it has an outsized impact, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2727.56s)]
*  as sort of Tucker's been saying. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2729.64s)]
*  No, I think the luxury point is once you reach [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2730.48s)]
*  a certain point, your attention can then shift to morality. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2733.12s)]
*  When you're starving in a street [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2738.2s)]
*  and you need to feed your children, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2740.2s)]
*  you're not focusing your whole day on the morality [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2742.4s)]
*  and better treatment of others in the world [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2745.52s)]
*  and extending morality to the rest of the world, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2747.36s)]
*  but when you have that luxury, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2750.12s)]
*  you have to focus your attention in that sense. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2751.7999999999997s)]
*  I do think that there's this large element [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2754.32s)]
*  that the term equality gets recast [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2755.84s)]
*  into every aspect of society, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2759.52s)]
*  which ultimately leads to this general point of view [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2761.28s)]
*  of Marxism, which is everyone has to have an equal outcome [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2763.6800000000003s)]
*  versus an equal opportunity, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2767.2400000000002s)]
*  and that's where the prosperity takes this. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2769.36s)]
*  But I think I agree with a lot of what you're saying, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2772.6800000000003s)]
*  but I think it's maybe more profound than that. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2775.28s)]
*  I mean, you're absolutely right [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2777.6400000000003s)]
*  that only societies that have reached a certain point [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2779.48s)]
*  can afford to think about certain things. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2781.52s)]
*  You don't see, you know, hunter-gather societies [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2783.04s)]
*  don't debate effective altruism [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2784.8s)]
*  because they're looking for roots, okay? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2786.32s)]
*  So I agree with that. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2787.6400000000003s)]
*  However, if you look at the behavior of, you know, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2789.4s)]
*  some of the richest people in our society, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2792.6800000000003s)]
*  and I can't speak to Dustin Moskowitz, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2794.4s)]
*  but I have the, you know, I know people like that. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2795.88s)]
*  What they're funding are not exactly luxury beliefs, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2799.1200000000003s)]
*  it's they're like funding destruction, actually. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2802.84s)]
*  And so like previous generations of liberal rich people [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2804.92s)]
*  funded things like public libraries, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2808.84s)]
*  summer camps for poor kids, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2811.32s)]
*  remember the New York Times used to have these fundraisers, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2812.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, fresh air fund or whatever. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2815.28s)]
*  And people made fun of it. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2816.12s)]
*  I always kind of liked that. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2817.16s)]
*  Like you have extra money and like, you know, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2818.12s)]
*  help the poor kids. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2820.4s)]
*  You know, whether it works or not, we can debate, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2821.68s)]
*  but like, I get it. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2823.12s)]
*  But Dustin Moskowitz, if you're Dustin Moskowitz, [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2825.0s)]
*  or any, I don't mean to pick on him, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2827.0s)]
*  but any like really rich person, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2828.04s)]
*  and you're at Baker's Bay or some discovery property [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2829.72s)]
*  that you and your billionaire friends go to, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2832.08s)]
*  you might occur to you like, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2834.44s)]
*  why not build one of these for like all the poor kids? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2835.28s)]
*  Like only poor black kids get to go to this resort [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2837.6s)]
*  for a week. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2840.6s)]
*  And that might be, it might work, it might not work. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2841.48s)]
*  Like all of American social, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2845.28s)]
*  the history of American social reform [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2846.56s)]
*  is kind of species of that. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2847.88s)]
*  Like we're gonna help poor people by doing this or that. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2849.6800000000003s)]
*  That's not what they're doing. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2851.76s)]
*  It's like, hey, poor people, here's some more crack pipes. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2852.96s)]
*  And like we're gonna, [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2854.96s)]
*  it's immoral to criticize your drug addiction. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2855.8s)]
*  And what we need are more black people selling weed, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2857.88s)]
*  or it's cool to set fires, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2860.6800000000003s)]
*  or we can't criticize you for burning down Wendy's. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2862.56s)]
*  Like what? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2864.6400000000003s)]
*  That is not the same thing. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2865.92s)]
*  That is super dark. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2869.1200000000003s)]
*  There's no even possibility of uplift or advancement. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2871.0s)]
*  It's just the opposite. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2873.88s)]
*  They know it. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2874.92s)]
*  These are smart people. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2875.76s)]
*  So like, what are we looking at? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2876.6400000000003s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2878.36s)]
*  Well, Tucker, he's in Dustin's mind. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2879.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm sure he believes he's doing the right thing. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2881.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2884.1600000000003s)]
*  He thinks he's funding social justice. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2885.0s)]
*  I think like Soros would be an even better example, right? [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2887.2000000000003s)]
*  Where like, it's hard to argue that what he's funding [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2889.88s)]
*  is not extremely destructive. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2893.0s)]
*  So the revolutionary politics [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2895.1600000000003s)]
*  are not somehow coming from below [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2896.7000000000003s)]
*  the way you would expect a revolution to normally happen. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2899.36s)]
*  They're being imposed from above [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2901.84s)]
*  by some of the biggest winners in our society. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2904.7200000000003s)]
*  And that is weird. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2906.0s)]
*  That is a contradiction. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2906.84s)]
*  They're not being fossil. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2907.92s)]
*  That is not what you expect. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2908.76s)]
*  It is a bizarre outcome. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2909.6000000000004s)]
*  Let's- [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2911.44s)]
*  It's exactly what you'd expect. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2912.28s)]
*  And it's exactly what happened in the Bolshevik Revolution. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2913.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, half of the Romanov household, [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2916.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, Nicholas II, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2919.28s)]
*  who was murdered with his wife and children in the basement, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2921.2400000000002s)]
*  as you know, by the Bolsheviks, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2923.32s)]
*  his extended household supported the Bolsheviks. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2924.96s)]
*  Rich people, who are a small minority, by the way. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2928.1200000000003s)]
*  There are a million different revolutionary groups [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2930.54s)]
*  at the end of the First World War in Russia. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2932.62s)]
*  Clearly there was gonna be a change. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2934.34s)]
*  Clearly the monarchy was doomed. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2935.5s)]
*  And there were a lot of different options. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2936.7s)]
*  And the most radical, crazy, nihilistic, atheistic option [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2938.2999999999997s)]
*  was the Bolsheviks. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2942.14s)]
*  And they had the support of the rich people. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2942.98s)]
*  And like, including the Czar's family. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2944.7799999999997s)]
*  So like, what is that? [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2946.64s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2947.62s)]
*  Always the same thing. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2948.94s)]
*  It's the people with the most [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2950.18s)]
*  have the strongest desire to kill themselves [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2952.06s)]
*  and their society. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2954.1s)]
*  That's just true. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2955.1s)]
*  It's an interesting theory. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2956.06s)]
*  I mean, there are some people who are very thoughtful, right? [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2957.06s)]
*  You have Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2959.14s)]
*  who are thinking about philanthropy [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2960.42s)]
*  in a very thoughtful way. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2961.7s)]
*  Now they can make mistakes, of course, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2962.8599999999997s)]
*  but they're thinking, hey, where's the most suffering? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2964.22s)]
*  How do I work backwards from mosquito tans to vaccines [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2966.2999999999997s)]
*  or whatever we perceive is, what they perceive [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2969.8199999999997s)]
*  is the most suffering they can relieve in the world. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2972.5s)]
*  So it does seem like it can go either way. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2975.58s)]
*  Tucker, do you think it's because most people [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2976.9399999999996s)]
*  that get very wealthy, very fast, feel like it was unfair [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2979.2999999999997s)]
*  and they feel guilty and then they have to like, [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2984.02s)]
*  destroy the system that got them there? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2985.8999999999996s)]
*  I think there's a lot. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2988.3799999999997s)]
*  I think that's such a deep point though, [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2989.2999999999997s)]
*  and I know that you live among people, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2991.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, you're familiar with this world, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2995.18s)]
*  and only someone who is could say that [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2996.74s)]
*  because you're absolutely right. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2998.1s)]
*  Rich people are not all the same. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=2999.38s)]
*  If you meet someone who made his money [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3001.1s)]
*  incrementally over time, he's much less likely [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3002.86s)]
*  to have the desire, you may not agree with him on everything, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3006.02s)]
*  he may be a good person, a bad person, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3008.58s)]
*  but he doesn't wanna tear it down [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3010.1s)]
*  and he doesn't feel especially guilty for what he has. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3012.3399999999997s)]
*  And I have found just a non-political point, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3014.2999999999997s)]
*  but as I get older, I wanna spend less time [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3016.22s)]
*  with people who hate themselves [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3018.54s)]
*  because they're not capable of loving other people. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3020.2599999999998s)]
*  Like, that's not a good place to start actually [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3023.14s)]
*  as a person to hate yourself or feel super guilty, [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3025.4199999999996s)]
*  it really isn't. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3028.06s)]
*  You don't end up helping others when you feel that way. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3028.9399999999996s)]
*  But when you find people who inherited a lot of money, [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3031.8599999999997s)]
*  we never talk about that, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3034.1s)]
*  it's a huge problem in this country. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3035.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm not arguing for the death tax at all, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3037.06s)]
*  but I'm just saying as an observation, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3039.62s)]
*  there's a huge class of people [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3041.98s)]
*  with massive inherited wealth [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3043.8599999999997s)]
*  and they're almost all horrible. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3045.54s)]
*  Not all of them, I mean, I know very well [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3047.3799999999997s)]
*  I know some of them and they're fine, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3049.7s)]
*  some of them are great. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3050.8599999999997s)]
*  But as a class, they're awful and they don't help at all. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3051.7799999999997s)]
*  And they're also super annoying and dumb. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3055.14s)]
*  And I think it's just true and everyone knows it's true. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3057.3399999999997s)]
*  But we're about to do that [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3060.98s)]
*  for tens of millions of Americans, right? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3062.8199999999997s)]
*  You know, we're about to go [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3064.74s)]
*  the largest generation of wealth transfer beyond imagination. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3065.98s)]
*  We're talking trillions and trillions and trillions. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3069.7s)]
*  So that problem that you just encapsulated, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3072.3399999999997s)]
*  we're gonna cascade across tens of millions of Americans. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3075.06s)]
*  It's also happening in Japan. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3078.78s)]
*  And in Japan, they have a negative growth rate as well. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3080.9s)]
*  Let's pivot to a topic that- [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3084.2200000000003s)]
*  Wait, can I ask you, have you been to Japan recently? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3086.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I was there last year. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3089.38s)]
*  Okay, so me too. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3090.98s)]
*  So, you know, you always read like all the libertarian [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3091.9s)]
*  economists in the Wall Street Journal, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3096.9s)]
*  they're always like, oh, Japan's a disaster, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3098.3s)]
*  negative growth. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3100.02s)]
*  And then you go to Japan. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3100.94s)]
*  Oh, it's the best place you could ever visit. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3102.38s)]
*  It's my favorite country, hands down. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3104.94s)]
*  Did you go to Tokyo? [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3106.38s)]
*  Did you go skiing in Niseko? [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3107.22s)]
*  Where'd you go? [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3108.2599999999998s)]
*  I went to Kyoto and Tokyo [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3109.1s)]
*  and I'll be back to ski on the North Island [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3110.3799999999997s)]
*  because it's like, why wouldn't you? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3112.02s)]
*  It's like the perfect place, right? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3113.1s)]
*  Have you ever skied in Niseko? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3113.9399999999996s)]
*  I never have, but I'm very psyched. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3115.4199999999996s)]
*  I went last year. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3117.2599999999998s)]
*  It is like 25 out of 30 days in January and February. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3118.1s)]
*  It dumps powder and the powder is like dust. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3121.8199999999997s)]
*  It's like makes Utah powder look like heavy. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3124.9399999999996s)]
*  It is insane. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3127.66s)]
*  I'm going back if you wanna go February. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3129.2599999999998s)]
*  I- [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3131.2999999999997s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3132.14s)]
*  I have a video to take out. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3132.98s)]
*  I'm already with Tucker right now. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3134.9s)]
*  The two of you could share a room. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3136.1000000000004s)]
*  You guys can have like one. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3137.82s)]
*  I'm good, Ben. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3139.2200000000003s)]
*  This is gonna make Sacks lose his mind [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3140.26s)]
*  if Tucker and I go to Niseko. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3142.1000000000004s)]
*  But can I just ask you a question? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3143.7400000000002s)]
*  Like if Japan is the butt of every joke [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3144.98s)]
*  that economists tell or the focus of the concern [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3149.9s)]
*  of economy, you know, lots of chin tugging [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3152.86s)]
*  and fretting about Japan's negative growth economy. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3154.3s)]
*  And then you go to Japan [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3156.26s)]
*  and there's literally not one piece of litter [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3157.38s)]
*  and four-year-olds ride the subway on a company. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3159.02s)]
*  Highest function society you could imagine, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3160.9s)]
*  but yet birth rate is going down. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3163.14s)]
*  That's the only thing that's strange. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3164.8199999999997s)]
*  The birth rate is a real thing. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3165.66s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3166.7799999999997s)]
*  That's probably the product [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3167.62s)]
*  of getting atomic bombs dropped on you. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3168.58s)]
*  Or it may be the fact also that like [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3170.8199999999997s)]
*  the highest testosterone males flew their planes [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3172.62s)]
*  into US aircraft carriers or whatever. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3174.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, there's probably a lot of reasons. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3176.5s)]
*  Interesting theory. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3177.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, that's a real thing, by the way. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3179.2599999999998s)]
*  You kill all the high team males and your society changes. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3180.98s)]
*  But I don't think that we're using the right measurements. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3183.14s)]
*  And I do think that we're taking economists [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3186.42s)]
*  a little more seriously than they deserve [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3188.02s)]
*  because they're not describing what Japan actually is, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3190.1s)]
*  which is freaking awesome [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3193.2599999999998s)]
*  and way more functional than our society, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3194.62s)]
*  despite the massive disparity in growth rates. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3196.86s)]
*  The thing you'll find is every person in Japan [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3198.66s)]
*  takes their job that they're doing [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3200.7s)]
*  as incredibly important and has massive pride in it. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3202.74s)]
*  That's why when you go there as an American, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3205.22s)]
*  you're like, wait, wasn't this what America was about? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3206.94s)]
*  It's really shocking as Americans. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3209.42s)]
*  You're like, this is what I want society to be. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3211.94s)]
*  I want the person who works in the subway [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3213.46s)]
*  or the stock market or the newspaper [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3215.62s)]
*  to take their job deadly serious [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3217.42s)]
*  and put their best effort in. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3219.1s)]
*  So why should I care about growth rate? [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3220.7799999999997s)]
*  Wait, but hold on though. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3222.3399999999997s)]
*  Why should I care about economic growth, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3223.46s)]
*  at least as measured in the conventional sense? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3226.42s)]
*  The only reason is if you have a lot of debt. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3228.98s)]
*  That's it. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3230.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3231.7799999999997s)]
*  If you didn't have all the debt, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3232.62s)]
*  you shouldn't care about economic growth rate [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3234.86s)]
*  with respect to the measure of prosperity. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3236.38s)]
*  The strange thing about it is- [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3238.14s)]
*  Well, also, if the pie isn't getting bigger [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3239.2599999999998s)]
*  and people aren't doing better, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3242.58s)]
*  then that does sow the seeds for a revolution. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3244.18s)]
*  All this divisiveness will start to explode [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3248.38s)]
*  if people don't feel like their circumstances [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3250.94s)]
*  are getting better off. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3253.3s)]
*  This is where, in this one limited way, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3254.7000000000003s)]
*  I guess I'd be in favor of rapid change, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3257.0600000000004s)]
*  which is the technological area. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3259.86s)]
*  I'm against revolutionary politics. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3262.46s)]
*  I'm against that kind of revolutionary change [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3264.3s)]
*  because it almost never works out, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3265.94s)]
*  but I do think that revolutionary change [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3267.1000000000004s)]
*  in the narrow category of technology [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3269.82s)]
*  is ultimately good for us. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3272.42s)]
*  I know it creates challenges. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3274.5s)]
*  I know it creates disruption. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3275.5800000000004s)]
*  I know people do lose their jobs [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3276.66s)]
*  and have to find new ones, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3279.06s)]
*  but it is the basis for American prosperity [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3280.2599999999998s)]
*  and the basis for our economy being productive [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3282.94s)]
*  and America having a powerful military [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3285.2599999999998s)]
*  and all those things. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3287.1s)]
*  I don't know if this is a difference between us, Tucker, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3288.58s)]
*  but I do think that in this area of technological change, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3290.58s)]
*  I'm not a dispositional conservative. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3295.14s)]
*  This is like Peter Thiel. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3297.58s)]
*  I don't want us to slow down. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3299.18s)]
*  Actually, I want us to be successful. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3300.42s)]
*  It feels like actually it's the people on the left [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3303.74s)]
*  who are generally in this camp [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3306.7799999999997s)]
*  of wanting to slow us down and admire us in regulations [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3309.2999999999997s)]
*  and make it harder to make progress technologically [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3312.8999999999996s)]
*  because that's something they don't control. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3318.02s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3319.7s)]
*  I guess the net result is what I care about. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3320.54s)]
*  I think it's, if you talk to old people, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3323.2599999999998s)]
*  which now that I'm getting older [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3326.2999999999997s)]
*  and I've talked to older relatives and stuff, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3328.06s)]
*  what bothers you? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3330.4199999999996s)]
*  I used to think it was taking a leak six times a night, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3331.66s)]
*  but it's really not. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3334.94s)]
*  The thing that bothers old people I've spoken to anyway [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3336.1s)]
*  is the change. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3339.42s)]
*  It's like they just don't recognize it [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3340.2599999999998s)]
*  and that's really hard for people to deal with. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3341.8999999999996s)]
*  And so all I'm saying, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3343.98s)]
*  I'm certainly not calling for a halt [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3345.74s)]
*  to technological progress. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3347.22s)]
*  That would be terrible. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3348.42s)]
*  All I'm saying is in tandem with those advancements [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3349.7799999999997s)]
*  should be the concern about people's ability [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3353.66s)]
*  to digest massive change. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3357.42s)]
*  And let's keep some things the same. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3359.18s)]
*  You just can't change everything. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3362.3s)]
*  It's like bad, it's super bad. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3363.14s)]
*  So maybe we get AI, but let's keep Halloween. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3364.26s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3367.42s)]
*  Yeah, so you're arguing for tradition [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3368.26s)]
*  and things that bring people together. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3370.1s)]
*  This country was built off of immigrants, obviously, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3372.54s)]
*  and this is one of the most polarizing issues, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3376.46s)]
*  Tucker, in each election cycle [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3379.78s)]
*  and in the country at large right now. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3382.54s)]
*  What is your vision for how American immigration [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3385.82s)]
*  should work here in the 21st century? [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3390.66s)]
*  Ideally, or right now? [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3394.66s)]
*  Right now, and then ideally. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3396.2999999999997s)]
*  Let's start with what would you do right now, short term? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3398.14s)]
*  Well, actually, if you don't mind, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3400.14s)]
*  I'll quickly invert it and say, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3401.7s)]
*  of course, the goal is just a rational immigration policy [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3403.14s)]
*  whose purpose is to help your country. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3406.8199999999997s)]
*  What would that look like? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3408.7s)]
*  And so I can see an argument, for example, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3409.54s)]
*  if you needed, I don't know. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3411.42s)]
*  There was a time for the guy who's just saying, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3413.3799999999997s)]
*  my college roommate, my best friend, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3415.74s)]
*  came to this country from India [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3417.74s)]
*  because both his parents were physicians [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3419.74s)]
*  and there was a lack of physicians with deindustrialization [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3421.18s)]
*  and everyone was moving out of the small towns, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3424.18s)]
*  and so we expedited the visas of foreign physicians. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3425.58s)]
*  Most of them were Indians, I think most were Indians. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3428.58s)]
*  His parents actually came from Africa, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3431.3799999999997s)]
*  but whatever, the point is, they're Indian doctors [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3432.66s)]
*  and they came here and they settled in a little town [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3434.5s)]
*  in Massachusetts, a rural town, dying mill town, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3437.3799999999997s)]
*  and it was great. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3440.4199999999996s)]
*  It was great for them, it was great for the town. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3441.4199999999996s)]
*  The guy became my best friend. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3444.54s)]
*  I mean, that's what you want, right? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3445.62s)]
*  We need this and we're gonna, in a very smart, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3448.18s)]
*  intentional way, try to get it on the world market [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3450.3399999999997s)]
*  and we can and we will, and I'm totally for that. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3454.2599999999998s)]
*  What we're doing now is throwing open the doors [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3457.22s)]
*  to anyone who wants to come here [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3460.2999999999997s)]
*  from the poorest countries in the world [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3461.7799999999997s)]
*  at a scale that we can't possibly digest. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3463.5s)]
*  So how many people are here illegally working off the books? [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3465.7799999999997s)]
*  Some estimates, 60, 70 million. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3468.74s)]
*  Those are real estimates, by the way, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3470.58s)]
*  not crackpot estimates, but the truth is we don't know. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3472.1s)]
*  We have no idea, so we've completely lost control [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3474.54s)]
*  and we don't know who these people are. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3477.34s)]
*  I honestly think most of them are here for a better life. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3479.42s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3482.2200000000003s)]
*  I think most of them are probably good people. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3483.0600000000004s)]
*  I think most of them agree with my politics, actually, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3484.0600000000004s)]
*  for whatever it's worth. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3486.5800000000004s)]
*  Definitely much more than the unhappy private equity wives [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3487.82s)]
*  do, for sure. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3490.6600000000003s)]
*  The average guy from Nigeria is on my side. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3491.7000000000003s)]
*  Every Salvadoran agrees with me, so I like that, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3494.5s)]
*  but I also think it's too much, actually. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3497.6200000000003s)]
*  At exactly the moment when native-born Americans' [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3500.34s)]
*  birth rates are tanking, over 100,000 people die [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3502.9s)]
*  of fentanyl O.D.s and we're pushing euthanasia [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3506.54s)]
*  on the population, which we are, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3510.18s)]
*  basically you're saying I've given up on the people [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3513.5s)]
*  who live here, whatever their color or background, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3515.1s)]
*  and we're just gonna import new people [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3517.18s)]
*  and replace them with new people. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3518.58s)]
*  That's literally what's happening. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3519.54s)]
*  And when you say that out loud, they freak out [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3520.86s)]
*  and call you some sort of crazed bigot [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3523.02s)]
*  for saying the word replacement, but that's what it is. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3524.82s)]
*  And it's happening in Western Europe and Ireland, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3527.7s)]
*  particularly, that's what those riots were about. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3529.46s)]
*  Not that I'm endorsing the riots, but that's what that was. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3532.82s)]
*  And that's insane for a government to do to its own people. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3535.02s)]
*  It's totally insane. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3538.22s)]
*  And more than anything, it is an expression of loathing [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3539.94s)]
*  for the people who live there. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3544.74s)]
*  It's a dilution of their political power, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3546.34s)]
*  it's a dilution of their economic power, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3548.02s)]
*  it's the total destruction of the basic services [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3549.86s)]
*  that they paid for, like schools, hospitals, roads. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3552.34s)]
*  Those are gone. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3555.58s)]
*  Last thing I'll say is, people say, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3557.78s)]
*  well, immigrants are coming here looking for a better life, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3559.58s)]
*  and I believe that, having talked to a lot of immigrants [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3562.2599999999998s)]
*  and grown up around them in Southern California, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3564.34s)]
*  I totally believe that. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3565.78s)]
*  But the question for government is, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3567.06s)]
*  am I making the citizen's life better? [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3568.58s)]
*  It's like, no one even thinks that. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3572.2200000000003s)]
*  So it was importing people making the life. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3573.86s)]
*  So when my friend's parents came, both physicians, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3576.1800000000003s)]
*  to the little town, little mill town in New England, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3579.3s)]
*  his parents made the town better [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3581.78s)]
*  for the people who lived there, they were the doctors. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3583.38s)]
*  And they were super successful, actually, and great people. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3585.78s)]
*  Tucker, can you give us a rundown [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3588.9s)]
*  of the current political landscape? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3590.58s)]
*  Just tell us, I'm just really curious [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3592.66s)]
*  what you think about RFK, Biden, Trump, Vive, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3594.2599999999998s)]
*  maybe like 10, 15 seconds on each. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3598.46s)]
*  It's so hard. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3600.2999999999997s)]
*  It's so hard. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3601.14s)]
*  I mean, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3602.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, the thing that jumps out today, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3606.46s)]
*  my view changes all the time. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3607.8599999999997s)]
*  I don't think Biden can be the nominee. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3609.1s)]
*  His only point was to, you know, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3610.94s)]
*  stop Bernie Sanders, basically, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3614.1s)]
*  and he's outlived his usefulness. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3615.8999999999996s)]
*  So I think he'll be, I'm pretty sure he'll be replaced. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3618.46s)]
*  But as on the Republican side, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3620.06s)]
*  and the independents, you know, it's so hard to know. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3622.3s)]
*  I'm just mesmerized by the love for Nikki Haley, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3625.3s)]
*  who's like the most, and I'm sorry, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3628.82s)]
*  for example, I saw Jamie Dimon, who I really like, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3632.02s)]
*  and I know, and I have always admired. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3634.1800000000003s)]
*  But when Jamie Dimon starts like free-balling [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3636.82s)]
*  on, you know, Nikki Haley, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3639.86s)]
*  and saying nonsensical things about Nikki Haley, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3641.0600000000004s)]
*  I'm like, I wanna call him and say, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3642.7400000000002s)]
*  you're humiliating yourself. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3643.98s)]
*  First of all, you're way out of your depth. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3645.0600000000004s)]
*  You have no idea what you're talking about. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3646.3s)]
*  But for another, you're just betraying [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3648.1800000000003s)]
*  how completely out of touch you were. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3649.7000000000003s)]
*  And I think Jamie got, and again, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3650.94s)]
*  I say this with admiration for Jamie Dimon, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3652.46s)]
*  which is long held. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3653.94s)]
*  But like, if you get to a place where you think [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3656.06s)]
*  that Nikki Haley has a shot of getting elected [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3658.66s)]
*  in a free and fair election, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3661.1s)]
*  like you have no idea what's going on in your own country. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3662.78s)]
*  It's just embarrassing to say that. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3664.5s)]
*  Super embarrassing. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3665.94s)]
*  Explain to the audience, unpack that. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3667.5s)]
*  Why is Nikki Haley not going to hire you? [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3668.78s)]
*  Really, it's not personal. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3670.78s)]
*  I actually don't care for Nikki Haley as a person, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3671.98s)]
*  but that's immaterial. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3673.82s)]
*  Nikki Haley's program, or what she stands for, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3675.46s)]
*  or what she believes, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3678.22s)]
*  maybe moral or immoral, God will judge. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3679.74s)]
*  It's not popular with the public. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3681.9399999999996s)]
*  And it's super easy to know that. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3683.8599999999997s)]
*  Her stance on war, specifically, yeah. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3685.2599999999998s)]
*  Her stance on war and on economics. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3687.18s)]
*  And we know that from looking at the Gallup poll, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3689.06s)]
*  which is a rolling survey of people's attitudes on things. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3691.22s)]
*  And in an actual democracy, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3694.14s)]
*  you would see the leading candidates, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3696.4599999999996s)]
*  for people who hope to become the leading candidates, [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3697.8999999999996s)]
*  articulate concerns and lay out views [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3700.06s)]
*  that reflected the concerns of the population [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3703.02s)]
*  who are going to vote them into office. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3706.3399999999997s)]
*  Who does that the most? [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3709.06s)]
*  Right now. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3710.2599999999998s)]
*  Oh, Trump. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3711.1s)]
*  Is it fair to say Nikki Haley is basically [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3711.94s)]
*  an unreconstructed Bush Republican? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3713.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, her views are basically the same views [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3715.42s)]
*  of George W. Bush. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3717.9s)]
*  She, once again, is in all sorts of new wars. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3719.02s)]
*  And I don't even think she regrets the forever wars [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3721.22s)]
*  of the Middle East that were so disastrous. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3724.14s)]
*  I haven't heard one word of criticism from her, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3726.06s)]
*  or remorse that she supported all of those things. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3729.02s)]
*  And on the economic policies, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3731.7s)]
*  it's kind of this like corporatism. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3732.94s)]
*  It's like the whole Trump rebellion [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3735.78s)]
*  never even happened in the Republican Party. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3738.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3739.78s)]
*  It's just like right back to the past. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3740.6200000000003s)]
*  And the fact that the establishment [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3742.26s)]
*  is sort of coalescing around her [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3744.42s)]
*  kind of tells me that, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3746.1000000000004s)]
*  as much as I didn't want to believe this, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3748.46s)]
*  I think that Trump is still the indispensable figure [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3750.26s)]
*  in the Republican Party. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3753.86s)]
*  Because if you take him away, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3755.6200000000003s)]
*  they're going to revert right back to where they were. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3757.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3759.78s)]
*  They're going to go right back to the factory settings [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3760.6200000000003s)]
*  of Republicans, which is Bush Republicanism. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3762.34s)]
*  Tucker, can you just finish the rest of them? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3764.86s)]
*  RFK, Vivek, Trump. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3766.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, I know Vivek well personally, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3769.1400000000003s)]
*  and it shows that I'm out of touch too. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3772.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean, you know, I'm 54. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3775.54s)]
*  So I don't have my finger on every pulse. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3777.38s)]
*  But so I like Vivek, actually. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3779.94s)]
*  And, but I see these surveys where he's not doing well [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3781.86s)]
*  and people don't like his personality or whatever. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3784.82s)]
*  He's a little overbearing. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3787.02s)]
*  That never bothers me at all. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3789.34s)]
*  I'm just not put off by that at all. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3790.86s)]
*  And I'm a little bit confused by why he's not doing better. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3792.58s)]
*  Again, that's a reflection on, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3796.1s)]
*  I've just made fun of Jamie Dimon. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3797.42s)]
*  Here I am doing it myself. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3799.38s)]
*  Like, why isn't Vivek doing better? [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3800.54s)]
*  I'm sure there are reasons. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3802.2599999999998s)]
*  I just don't, I think his program is solid. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3803.1s)]
*  I think he's reasonable. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3805.06s)]
*  I think he's smart. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3806.5s)]
*  I don't think he has some creepy agenda. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3807.34s)]
*  So, but he's not doing well. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3810.9s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3812.5s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy, I know quite well and think a lot of him. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3814.2999999999997s)]
*  And he's a very, I think he's a decent man [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3819.1s)]
*  and a principled person. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3821.86s)]
*  I think he's smart. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3823.82s)]
*  You know, I don't have quite as much confidence [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3826.38s)]
*  in maybe some of the people around him. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3829.42s)]
*  I'm not, I feel like maybe there are other agendas [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3831.1400000000003s)]
*  that he's not aware of. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3834.3s)]
*  You know, I don't know, I can't assess, but yeah. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3835.1400000000003s)]
*  So that's what I think of that. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3839.38s)]
*  And President Trump? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3840.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, the New York Times had a piece, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3841.78s)]
*  I think it was Jonathan Swan, who's smart, [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3844.94s)]
*  and had a piece telling you what you already knew kind of, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3847.3s)]
*  but proving it with numbers that Trump became the nominee [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3850.46s)]
*  in August of last year, 2022, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3854.82s)]
*  when the FBI went through his wife's underwear drawer [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3857.94s)]
*  in his house. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3860.2200000000003s)]
*  Like that was so insane that even if you're like, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3861.06s)]
*  oh, I can't deal with more Trump [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3863.1s)]
*  and he didn't actually do anything, [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3864.46s)]
*  he put Jared in charge, you know, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3865.98s)]
*  like there are lots of frustrations you could have [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3867.5s)]
*  about Trump if you supported Trump [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3869.02s)]
*  and you could be disappointed. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3870.94s)]
*  But the second the FBI raids his house [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3872.82s)]
*  on a documents charge, and anyone from Washington, as I am, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3875.66s)]
*  can tell you that's like insane. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3878.98s)]
*  Like every, that's like so common, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3881.02s)]
*  if they're charging him for that, that's a joke. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3883.46s)]
*  Where are the felonies he supposedly committed? [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3885.78s)]
*  I was led to believe he like murdered people [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3888.02s)]
*  and buried them in the Meadowlands. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3890.1s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3892.46s)]
*  Like that's the best they got when they did that. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3893.3s)]
*  I know for a fact, and this piece showed it, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3897.22s)]
*  but I knew it already, a lot of people were like, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3899.38s)]
*  you know, I have mixed feelings about Trump, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3901.46s)]
*  or I don't wanna deal with more Trump drama, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3903.14s)]
*  but if this is allowed to happen, our system won't continue. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3904.94s)]
*  That's so outrageous that, I mean, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3908.38s)]
*  let's just stop lying about it. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3910.98s)]
*  That's a political prosecution. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3912.34s)]
*  You can't have that. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3914.1s)]
*  Of the presidential front runner, you can't have that. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3915.42s)]
*  We already did it with Nixon. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3918.34s)]
*  You can't do that again. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3919.46s)]
*  And so I think that's the key to his surge. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3921.06s)]
*  I really do think that. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3923.1s)]
*  Who's the Democratic nominee [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3924.1800000000003s)]
*  if you think Biden's not gonna be the nominee? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3925.54s)]
*  Oh, it's Gavin, Gavin. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3927.2200000000003s)]
*  It's Gavin, for sure. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3928.5s)]
*  Well, of course, because he's by far the most evil person [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3929.7000000000003s)]
*  in the Democratic party, and in the end, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3932.46s)]
*  they just sort of rise to the peak, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3934.86s)]
*  oil and water, man. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3937.5s)]
*  It's just good. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3938.58s)]
*  Tucker, just comment on Gavin vetoing the bill [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3941.46s)]
*  that said that you could kind of remove the parents, [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3945.6600000000003s)]
*  remove the child from the parents [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3948.5s)]
*  if the parents don't affirm the transgender rights [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3949.98s)]
*  of the child. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3952.1400000000003s)]
*  I think there was a lot of folks who sit in your camp, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3953.42s)]
*  typically, who were shocked and surprised and said, [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3955.7000000000003s)]
*  wow, I didn't know Gavin actually had a span of opinions, [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3958.42s)]
*  and this is interesting to see. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3963.02s)]
*  I mean, what's, like, yeah. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3964.38s)]
*  There's no one I know who thought that, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3966.46s)]
*  and everyone I know who watched that [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3968.34s)]
*  thought the same thing they thought when he met with Xi, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3970.26s)]
*  which is, oh, he's gonna be the nominee. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3972.2200000000003s)]
*  Of course, that's what that was. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3975.34s)]
*  I mean, I know Gavin Newsom, [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3976.7000000000003s)]
*  and I think a lot about Gavin Newsom, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3979.1800000000003s)]
*  many different things about Gavin Newsom, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3982.98s)]
*  but one thing I know for a fact about Gavin Newsom [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3984.3s)]
*  is he has the capacity to beat a lie detector test. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3986.62s)]
*  Gavin Newsom will say anything he needs to say, [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3990.22s)]
*  not like Biden's, not like this, actually, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3994.3799999999997s)]
*  whatever Biden's fault, he's not like this. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3995.9399999999996s)]
*  Like, Biden, you know, he has, like, guilt. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=3997.2999999999997s)]
*  If he's lying to you, he gets twitchy. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4000.54s)]
*  Gavin Newsom's palms don't sweat, [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4003.2599999999998s)]
*  his respiration doesn't increase, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4006.06s)]
*  his body temperature doesn't change. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4008.4599999999996s)]
*  Nothing changes in Gavin Newsom when he lies to your face, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4009.66s)]
*  and there are not that many people like that, actually. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4012.98s)]
*  That's a rare quality. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4015.3399999999997s)]
*  Like, to lock down the state, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4017.2599999999998s)]
*  to keep people's kids from getting an education, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4019.3s)]
*  and to arrest people for surfing, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4021.26s)]
*  and then go have dinner at the French Laundry, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4023.94s)]
*  like, most people couldn't do that. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4026.5800000000004s)]
*  They'd just be like, ah. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4028.02s)]
*  You're saying he's a sociopath. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4028.86s)]
*  He can lie and not care. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4030.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm not a psychiatrist, but I, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4032.0600000000004s)]
*  so I don't know that, I don't really know the category, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4034.0600000000004s)]
*  and I'm not gonna diagnose him, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4036.02s)]
*  but I'll just say, in 50 years [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4037.1000000000004s)]
*  of being around a lot of people, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4038.78s)]
*  I've met very few who can behave that way, very, very few. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4040.5s)]
*  It's a very unusual quality, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4043.54s)]
*  and of course, it's probably useful in politics. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4044.94s)]
*  Is he electable? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4047.6200000000003s)]
*  Is he electable? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4048.5s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4049.34s)]
*  Are the American people gonna see that [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4050.18s)]
*  the way that you see it, or? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4051.5s)]
*  Well, as you know, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4052.86s)]
*  the system in California does not include elections. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4053.82s)]
*  I mean, it has nothing to do with what the people think. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4056.34s)]
*  It's a machine state. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4058.98s)]
*  It's the most corrupt out of 50. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4060.5s)]
*  Kamala Harris was, like, despised by most Californians, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4062.46s)]
*  and she, you know, was a sitting U.S. Senator. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4065.62s)]
*  Diane, poor Diane Feinstein, my neighbor in Washington, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4068.26s)]
*  I don't think she was a horrible person, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4070.78s)]
*  just for the record, but she was non-compass menace, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4072.46s)]
*  and, like, she could have lived well beyond her death [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4075.18s)]
*  as a U.S. Senator. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4077.42s)]
*  So it's like, it's not a democratic state, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4078.82s)]
*  small D democratic state. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4081.1800000000003s)]
*  It's not run on the basis of what the population wants. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4082.2200000000003s)]
*  It's a fixed game in California, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4085.34s)]
*  and so it does make me very uncomfortable [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4086.86s)]
*  that someone from that political culture, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4089.62s)]
*  which is an utterly corrupt political culture, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4092.5s)]
*  an authoritarian political culture, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4095.34s)]
*  could, like, enter a presidential race, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4096.74s)]
*  because, like, clearly, what are you running on [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4099.18s)]
*  if you're Gavin Newsom? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4102.62s)]
*  As a native Californian, you know, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4103.74s)]
*  I know what the state was like in 1985, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4106.34s)]
*  because I lived there, [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4108.38s)]
*  and it's completely degraded from that time. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4109.38s)]
*  And, like, how did that happen? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4113.46s)]
*  Well, part of the big reason, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4114.66s)]
*  the big reason is the political leadership of the state. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4116.74s)]
*  You've got nothing to run on. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4118.58s)]
*  What are you running? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4120.26s)]
*  Have you driven through L.A. recently? [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4121.1s)]
*  Like, seriously. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4122.5s)]
*  So the fact that he would get in the race suggests, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4124.06s)]
*  you know, they think that they can win [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4128.54s)]
*  without the consent of voters, and that freaks me out. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4130.34s)]
*  Well, he'll have the media working on overdrive for him, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4134.58s)]
*  right? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4137.26s)]
*  I mean, they will turn him somehow into, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4138.1s)]
*  like, John F. Kennedy or something. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4140.38s)]
*  I mean, they will paper over all of his flaws, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4141.86s)]
*  and they'll basically write puff pieces. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4145.42s)]
*  It'll be, like, nonstop, and then they'll be attacking Trump. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4147.9s)]
*  So the media will put him over the top, I think, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4150.78s)]
*  if he can't be put over the top. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4152.62s)]
*  Well, assuming that we have the same media [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4154.46s)]
*  that we had in 2020, that's true, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4155.58s)]
*  but, I mean, that's why you just gotta pray every night [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4158.26s)]
*  for Elon's health, and I mean it, too. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4160.5s)]
*  I mean it. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4162.5s)]
*  It's the only platform at scale in the world [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4163.38s)]
*  that's pretty, you know, there's censorship on it, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4166.54s)]
*  but there's not mass censorship, actually. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4169.3s)]
*  There isn't. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4171.18s)]
*  And that's the only platform of its kind at scale. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4172.26s)]
*  It's the only one. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4177.26s)]
*  So let's talk about that, actually. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4178.1s)]
*  So, I mean, we've talked in this conversation [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4179.02s)]
*  about how our public discourse is inane [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4181.22s)]
*  and self-destructive and divisive. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4184.34s)]
*  I would add another word to that, which is controlled. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4188.18s)]
*  You know, controlled. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4191.14s)]
*  A good example of this, I think, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4193.1s)]
*  was just on the Ukraine war. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4194.38s)]
*  David Aramcomia, who is Zelensky's parliamentary leader, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4197.26s)]
*  who was the lead negotiator for the Ukrainians [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4201.660000000001s)]
*  at Istanbul in the first month of the war, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4204.9400000000005s)]
*  when there was a deal on the table, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4206.860000000001s)]
*  he just testified, basically said in an interview, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4208.46s)]
*  there was a deal on the table to shut the war down. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4210.9400000000005s)]
*  We just would have had to agree to make Ukraine neutral. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4213.3s)]
*  And, of course, the Biden administration told them not to. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4216.46s)]
*  This war is and has always been about NATO expansion, [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4218.860000000001s)]
*  and yet the party line from the media, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4222.94s)]
*  even as all of these proof points stack up, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4225.299999999999s)]
*  I mean, we're now on like the 10th person, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4227.98s)]
*  firsthand witness, to say that this is what this war is all about. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4230.46s)]
*  You still can't get the media to honestly report this. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4234.219999999999s)]
*  This is one example, okay? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4237.98s)]
*  And I believe that this is one of the reasons [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4239.9s)]
*  why you were fired, Tucker, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4241.62s)]
*  is because you were literally the only person [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4242.66s)]
*  on mainstream network news saying what the war is really about. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4245.94s)]
*  So this is like one really big example [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4250.139999999999s)]
*  is that we cannot get any truth on an issue as big as the Ukraine war. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4252.38s)]
*  So I guess my question for you is, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4256.3s)]
*  like, how does control like that happen? [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4258.9400000000005s)]
*  Like, I don't really understand it myself. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4261.86s)]
*  We live in a big, what's supposed to be a big democracy. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4263.62s)]
*  There's supposed to be, you know, a lot of media channels, [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4266.38s)]
*  but yet they all enforce a certain narrative [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4269.9800000000005s)]
*  on pretty much every issue. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4273.86s)]
*  But even, you know, again, I'm picking on, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4275.7s)]
*  I think one of the biggest issues right now, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4277.74s)]
*  which is this war we've got going on. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4279.02s)]
*  I mean, how does that happen? I don't understand it. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4281.62s)]
*  How do they maintain that control? [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4283.86s)]
*  This is one of my personal concerns about technology [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4285.26s)]
*  and about progress of all kinds, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4289.18s)]
*  which is you don't actually know where it's going. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4290.66s)]
*  You don't. I mean, your best forecasts or mine [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4292.46s)]
*  have very often been wrong. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4294.82s)]
*  And, you know, of course, the promise of the internet was diversity [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4296.14s)]
*  and access to information from a lot of different sources, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4300.099999999999s)]
*  unfiltered information. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4303.3s)]
*  You can talk to people in foreign countries for free. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4304.7s)]
*  You know, every American will have an encyclopedia at his fingertips, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4307.099999999999s)]
*  and people are going to be much more informed, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4311.42s)]
*  and no one will be able to control it, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4314.14s)]
*  because it's free and open. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4316.06s)]
*  And the effect has been, you know, the opposite. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4317.66s)]
*  There's less, I would argue, there's been less freedom [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4319.9800000000005s)]
*  in information than there was 30 years ago. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4325.34s)]
*  How did that happen? I mean, that's, it's a very, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4328.7s)]
*  I mean, you guys are much better situated to answer that question. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4330.58s)]
*  Someone should think about that, I think. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4332.7s)]
*  But the bottom line is, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4334.1s)]
*  there are just not that many pipelines, actually. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4335.5s)]
*  You know, in television, there were three big news channels, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4338.06s)]
*  cable, you know, broadcast kind of receded in importance. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4340.74s)]
*  It's mostly about prostate health now. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4343.54s)]
*  And so there were three big channels, two of them on one side, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4345.78s)]
*  one was on the other. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4348.62s)]
*  And then there were the social media giants, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4349.94s)]
*  but there are not that many of them, and they were all locked down, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4351.98s)]
*  and they were all riddled with intel, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4354.7s)]
*  in some cases, actual salaried intel officers. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4357.74s)]
*  Matt Taibbi's amazing reporting has shown this. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4361.099999999999s)]
*  Not just American, either, from foreign countries. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4363.34s)]
*  The whole thing was an op. It was insane. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4365.58s)]
*  And, you know, I'm not going to beat up on Fox News, [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4367.9s)]
*  but there was a kind of a fairly narrow band of acceptable views [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4371.58s)]
*  allowed on that channel. Is that control? Yes, it is. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4375.78s)]
*  And so there really was no remaining place with scale [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4378.78s)]
*  where someone with a dissenting view could give it voice. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4382.54s)]
*  And that's just crazy. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4386.339999999999s)]
*  It's the opposite of what we were promised. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4387.78s)]
*  But whatever, not to whine about it. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4389.339999999999s)]
*  But the existence of X, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4390.98s)]
*  where anyone around the world or in most countries anyway [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4393.379999999999s)]
*  can get for free a whole range of opinions that aren't controlled, [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4395.98s)]
*  that changes everything. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4401.0199999999995s)]
*  Like the primacy of control of information in a war cannot be overstated. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4403.139999999999s)]
*  Like that's, you can debate whether it's more important than ammunition, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4408.259999999999s)]
*  but it's right up there, you know? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4410.98s)]
*  And so I think this election, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4412.82s)]
*  if that platform stays free for the next 12 months, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4415.139999999999s)]
*  you know, I think we have a shot at least of a real election. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4419.299999999999s)]
*  But if it does, and I think they're going to do whatever they can [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4421.94s)]
*  to shut it down. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4423.94s)]
*  We also have web based shows, podcasts, [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4424.66s)]
*  and that even predated a little bit, Elon, taking over X. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4427.58s)]
*  There is a self correcting mechanism here. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4432.46s)]
*  If you feel too controlled, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4434.3s)]
*  like maybe perhaps you felt or you felt pressure at Fox, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4436.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't want to speak for you if you did, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4440.62s)]
*  then all of a sudden Joe Rogan, All In Podcast, whatever, [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4442.7s)]
*  podcasts all emerge and now your show on X, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4445.42s)]
*  and I'm sure it's going to be on other platforms as well. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4448.099999999999s)]
*  Maybe you can speak to what you think the impact of a post Fox, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4450.86s)]
*  Tucker Carlson show will be, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4456.42s)]
*  and how will you be able to sort of shape the show differently, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4458.74s)]
*  if at all? [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4462.299999999999s)]
*  And what's the mission here? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4463.179999999999s)]
*  That was just my first question we never really got to, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4464.0199999999995s)]
*  which is post Fox, post money, post fame, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4465.66s)]
*  what is Tucker Carlson's mission statement going forward? [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4470.219999999999s)]
*  What is your goal here? [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4473.42s)]
*  Just the same as before, and I should just be extra clear. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4474.259999999999s)]
*  I wish I could tell horror stories about Fox, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4477.299999999999s)]
*  forcing me to take some line or other, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4480.7s)]
*  but they really didn't. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4482.26s)]
*  But they didn't want the show anymore, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4484.82s)]
*  so that kind of tells you. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4486.5s)]
*  But anyway, the point is my intent in hosting that show [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4487.34s)]
*  is the same as my intent in hosting the show [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4491.62s)]
*  we're about to launch on X, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4493.42s)]
*  which is just do your best to say what you think is true, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4495.34s)]
*  bring perspectives and information [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4498.66s)]
*  that you don't think are widely covered to a larger audience, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4500.38s)]
*  and try and stay firm in that. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4503.9s)]
*  Admit when you're wrong, just be honest. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4506.02s)]
*  It's actually not, I got in this business [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4507.9s)]
*  because I hadn't graduated from college, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4511.42s)]
*  and my father's like, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4512.94s)]
*  it's a pretty pure meritocracy in journalism, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4514.259999999999s)]
*  you should do it. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4516.42s)]
*  And it's also pretty simple, no real skills required, [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4517.379999999999s)]
*  just be literate, which I was. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4520.099999999999s)]
*  And is the show going to evolve a little bit? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4521.42s)]
*  Because you've been doing this experiment, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4523.339999999999s)]
*  you've done about 40 episodes or so. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4525.0199999999995s)]
*  Here's the way that it already has evolved. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4526.66s)]
*  So I got laid off in April, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4528.54s)]
*  and I like to fish and bird hunt, so I did a lot of that. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4531.9s)]
*  And then I was like, I need to do something. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4535.46s)]
*  So I've been stuck in a studio for all these many, many years, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4537.0199999999995s)]
*  I couldn't really go anywhere. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4542.379999999999s)]
*  And I went, I took seven foreign trips in four months. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4543.74s)]
*  I just went to all these places where I knew people, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4546.7s)]
*  I was interested in what was going on. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4548.339999999999s)]
*  And I just found it amazing. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4550.299999999999s)]
*  Two things I found amazing. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4551.62s)]
*  One, the view of America, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4552.66s)]
*  the vantage you get from a foreign country [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4555.219999999999s)]
*  on what's happening on your own is completely different. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4556.94s)]
*  There's also a lot, the whole world is reshuffling, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4559.419999999999s)]
*  in my view, after the Ukraine War, February, 2022, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4561.9s)]
*  really did change a lot, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4565.7s)]
*  particularly with respect to America's place in the world. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4568.0199999999995s)]
*  That's worth covering. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4570.099999999999s)]
*  And the second thing I learned [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4571.26s)]
*  once I started putting videos up on X [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4572.34s)]
*  was that it's international. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4574.94s)]
*  I mean, I was just shocked by that. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4576.94s)]
*  I mean, because think about it, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4578.18s)]
*  I'm working for a US news channel. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4579.0199999999995s)]
*  It's one of three US news channels I've worked for. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4581.82s)]
*  CNN was international, but I was on CNN US. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4584.54s)]
*  So I'm just used to thinking about America, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4587.0599999999995s)]
*  being viewed by Americans, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4588.78s)]
*  having a conversation about this country. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4589.9s)]
*  I had no experience at all [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4591.3s)]
*  of a big international audience, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4594.22s)]
*  and that platform has that. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4595.9s)]
*  And so I was amazed by that. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4598.3s)]
*  And so we're gonna continue to cover the rest of the world. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4600.62s)]
*  I'm going over to Dubai in February, interviewing [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4604.42s)]
*  a bunch of heads of state. It's incredible. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4608.26s)]
*  I've been spending time in its lives. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4609.1s)]
*  It's just so interesting. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4610.78s)]
*  It's just so interesting. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4611.62s)]
*  There's so much going on. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4612.86s)]
*  It's like crazy. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4613.7s)]
*  People, and this is not a political point. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4614.54s)]
*  This is like a human point [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4617.42s)]
*  that bothers me almost more than anything politically, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4618.9s)]
*  which is the death of curiosity. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4621.42s)]
*  It's like people are not curious. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4623.9400000000005s)]
*  Like what the hell? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4625.14s)]
*  I thought the technological revolution [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4625.9800000000005s)]
*  would set off like explosions in the brain of every person. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4628.02s)]
*  Like what is that? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4631.34s)]
*  I want to learn more. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4632.18s)]
*  And it had exactly the opposite. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4633.0s)]
*  It's like lull me to sleep with TikTok. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4634.9s)]
*  Don't tell me more. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4636.66s)]
*  I don't want to know. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4637.5s)]
*  Just double down on what you already know, [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4638.34s)]
*  what you already believe over and over and over again. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4639.74s)]
*  Yeah, what is that? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4640.58s)]
*  What I'm like, I know I'm less certain in my beliefs. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4641.42s)]
*  I know that I know less than any time in my life, [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4645.34s)]
*  and I'm much more interested [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4647.86s)]
*  in many more things than I've ever been. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4649.34s)]
*  I think that's normal. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4652.18s)]
*  And I think there's something like in the water [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4653.02s)]
*  or something that's making people not care. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4654.62s)]
*  The UFO thing, like what? [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4656.62s)]
*  Whatever your views of that, like, well, what is that? [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4658.42s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4660.9400000000005s)]
*  And that's normal people don't want to hear it. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4662.1s)]
*  Why? [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4663.66s)]
*  I don't know, whatever. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4665.14s)]
*  I don't want to preach. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4665.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, post COVID, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4666.8s)]
*  we still don't have an accounting of what happened. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4667.74s)]
*  And Tucker, what do you think about the clip yesterday [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4669.66s)]
*  of Elon? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4674.14s)]
*  Let's play it for 45 seconds and then get your response. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4674.9800000000005s)]
*  Tucker Carlson. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4677.78s)]
*  Apology tour, if you will. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4679.26s)]
*  This had been said online. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4682.02s)]
*  There was all of the criticism. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4683.34s)]
*  There was advertisers leaving. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4684.66s)]
*  We talked to Bob Iger today. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4686.26s)]
*  I hope they stop. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4687.1s)]
*  You hope? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4688.820000000001s)]
*  Don't advertise. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4689.66s)]
*  You don't want them to advertise? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4691.38s)]
*  No. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4692.38s)]
*  What do you mean? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4693.34s)]
*  If somebody's gonna try to blackmail me with advertising, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4696.58s)]
*  blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4698.780000000001s)]
*  But. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4705.18s)]
*  Go fuck yourself. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4706.66s)]
*  Is that clear? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4709.900000000001s)]
*  I hope it is. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4711.700000000001s)]
*  Hey Bob, sharing the audience. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4713.46s)]
*  Well, let me ask you then. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4716.22s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4719.22s)]
*  All right, Tucker, your response to the good for you, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4720.1s)]
*  the old G-F-Y. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4723.06s)]
*  I mean, I've interviewed people every week [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4725.26s)]
*  for over 30 years. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4728.900000000001s)]
*  And so I know what it is to interview. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4730.46s)]
*  I just dropped my peri-egg, excuse me. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4732.34s)]
*  And I know, you know, I have a lot of experience [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4734.34s)]
*  interviewing people and I've interviewed Elon, you know. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4735.9800000000005s)]
*  And I don't understand how the New York Times character, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4738.1s)]
*  fussy little guy from the New York Times, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4741.34s)]
*  how could you not laugh? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4742.900000000001s)]
*  Like what? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4744.02s)]
*  He just told Bob Iger to fuck himself. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4745.02s)]
*  Don't get me started. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4748.860000000001s)]
*  You and I are in sync. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4749.700000000001s)]
*  Andrew R. Sorkin is amongst the weakest of moderators [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4750.54s)]
*  in your interview. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4753.820000000001s)]
*  But he's just, what a fussy little douche. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4754.660000000001s)]
*  Like that's the moment when you just like, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4756.9800000000005s)]
*  you were roughing it total. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4759.54s)]
*  Are you joking? [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4761.900000000001s)]
*  Elon Musk just told Bob Iger to fuck himself? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4763.14s)]
*  Like I'd be texting my wife. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4766.26s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4768.78s)]
*  I know. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4769.62s)]
*  No, of course I love it. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4770.98s)]
*  I love it. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4772.379999999999s)]
*  I am in the Iger thing. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4773.219999999999s)]
*  You know, I don't hate Bob Iger or anything, [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4776.82s)]
*  but like I keep hearing from people, you know, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4778.219999999999s)]
*  mutual people I know who know Bob Iger very well. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4780.58s)]
*  He's like very serious about running for president. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4782.9s)]
*  And it's like, if you really think, if you're Bob Iger, [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4785.0199999999995s)]
*  you can run for president. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4787.339999999999s)]
*  You have anything to offer people [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4788.74s)]
*  or they want you to be president. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4790.0599999999995s)]
*  Like you're pretty out of touch. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4791.0599999999995s)]
*  So I like that. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4791.9s)]
*  But you know, big picture, I'm really, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4793.54s)]
*  and I'm not just saying this [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4797.22s)]
*  because it aligns with my interests of some kind. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4798.06s)]
*  I mean it. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4801.34s)]
*  I'm worried about the pressure [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4802.5s)]
*  that's been brought to bear on that platform [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4804.06s)]
*  and this platform on X because it's the only one, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4805.860000000001s)]
*  the only big one, you know, huge one, international one, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4808.860000000001s)]
*  tens of millions of people, hundreds of millions of people. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4811.9800000000005s)]
*  Like they have to, they meaning the people [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4813.820000000001s)]
*  who would like to maintain the status quo, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4817.1s)]
*  kind of have to shut it down. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4819.34s)]
*  And I am just so hoping that, you know, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4821.3s)]
*  I can help in any way and that all decent people, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4826.78s)]
*  whatever their views, add their voice to a chorus [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4829.34s)]
*  that says, no, you can't shut down [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4832.9800000000005s)]
*  the one big free speech platform in the world. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4834.900000000001s)]
*  You can't do that. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4837.9800000000005s)]
*  Cause then it's just dictatorship. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4838.820000000001s)]
*  You're not free if you don't have free information [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4840.02s)]
*  and you can't say what you really think. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4841.9400000000005s)]
*  You were subject to a lot of these advertising attacks. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4843.06s)]
*  They went after Fox and your show specifically. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4846.860000000001s)]
*  And it worked. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4849.46s)]
*  They got people to not advertise on your show. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4850.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4853.42s)]
*  So these advertising boycotts do work. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4854.46s)]
*  So you don't actually rolling back [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4856.42s)]
*  your favorite in any way, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4857.900000000001s)]
*  in any way, doesn't make you top blew. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4858.860000000001s)]
*  You might pick any label on site that you like. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4861.66s)]
*  So I want to help explain the business model [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4864.9400000000005s)]
*  you know, going as far as Belt and Row, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4867.54s)]
*  the way through things looking at your show. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4871.58s)]
*  component to it. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4874.54s)]
*  And of course, we're selling ads against our content [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4876.14s)]
*  and we'll be doing that on X and on TuckerCarlson.com. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4881.14s)]
*  We'll be hosting the subscription part of it. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4884.86s)]
*  Of course, we're selling ads. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4888.5s)]
*  We'll have network ads too. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4889.86s)]
*  I mean, there are lots of different things you can do. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4892.18s)]
*  But in the end, you have to have some subscription component [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4895.32s)]
*  if you're gonna do it at scale. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4899.82s)]
*  I mean, we brought our whole staff, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4900.9s)]
*  almost our whole staff from Fox with us. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4902.34s)]
*  So we got a bunch of people. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4904.02s)]
*  We've got, you know, bigger ambitions [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4905.900000000001s)]
*  than have been on display so far. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4908.900000000001s)]
*  And we, you know, you gotta have more information. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4910.9800000000005s)]
*  And I would just say this about just having been [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4916.1s)]
*  in this one business my whole life. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4918.3s)]
*  The range of stories is the problem. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4920.38s)]
*  It's not that the stories are all totally dishonest. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4923.06s)]
*  Some are dishonest, but some are not. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4926.02s)]
*  They're technically true. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4928.3s)]
*  But they're taken from such a small pot of stories [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4929.860000000001s)]
*  that it's like, it's crazy. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4933.74s)]
*  There's all this stuff going on. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4934.86s)]
*  And it's just not, I mean, I was completely obsessed [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4936.139999999999s)]
*  and remain obsessed with the industrial sabotage [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4938.7s)]
*  of the Nord Stream pipeline. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4942.62s)]
*  It's like, that's like, that's a major historical event. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4944.139999999999s)]
*  Like you just ended the EU. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4947.42s)]
*  You just hobbled the economic engine of Europe, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4949.86s)]
*  which is Germany. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4952.42s)]
*  And like, who did that? [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4953.74s)]
*  And there were like very few stories on that. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4955.74s)]
*  That's like a very big deal. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4957.7s)]
*  And again, back to the curiosity thing, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4959.74s)]
*  but it's more than that. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4961.5s)]
*  It's like the people sort of know where not to go. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4962.34s)]
*  And I just feel like that's, first of all, that's soul death. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4966.900000000001s)]
*  You're not a free man if you're that constrained [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4970.3s)]
*  in your thinking, if you're letting somebody else [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4973.900000000001s)]
*  tell you what you're allowed to think. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4975.62s)]
*  How can your wife even sleep with you at that point? [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4977.38s)]
*  No one can respect you if you live like that. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4980.5s)]
*  A, B, you can't have a democracy. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4982.9400000000005s)]
*  You can't have a free country under those circumstances. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4985.06s)]
*  So I don't think I'm overstating it. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4987.42s)]
*  And so we're gonna try to, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4989.5s)]
*  I hope be one of many different similar efforts [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4991.46s)]
*  to just add to the sum total of information [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4995.06s)]
*  and analysis of that information. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4997.26s)]
*  Well, the end of democracy and sex would be kind of rough. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=4998.74s)]
*  I think, yeah, go ahead, Trimah. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5001.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5002.46s)]
*  I have a final question. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5003.46s)]
*  And I'm not trying to be a conspiracy theorist. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5004.74s)]
*  But if one of the presidential candidates called you [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5008.18s)]
*  and said, Tucker, be my VP. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5013.18s)]
*  And replace Kamala Harris? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5016.7s)]
*  I mean, I don't think I could do that. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5018.38s)]
*  She's a historic first. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5020.22s)]
*  All right, Tucker. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5021.5s)]
*  Would you consider it if Donald Trump gave you that call? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5022.42s)]
*  Well, of course I would consider it. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5025.620000000001s)]
*  I mean, you have no idea how open-minded I am. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5027.34s)]
*  I don't consider anything, actually. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5030.42s)]
*  But I mean, the truth is, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5033.34s)]
*  I kinda don't respect people who do stuff like that. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5035.46s)]
*  I really believe I've got a lot of theories [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5038.9400000000005s)]
*  which I will not inflict on you, [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5040.580000000001s)]
*  but which I do inflict on my own four children. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5041.740000000001s)]
*  And my main theory of life is [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5044.34s)]
*  that you should do what you were designed to do. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5046.22s)]
*  I don't believe this whole, [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5048.18s)]
*  you can be whatever you wanna be thing. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5049.14s)]
*  I think it's an absurd lie. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5051.82s)]
*  I think we're made for certain things. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5053.0599999999995s)]
*  We have certain aptitudes. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5054.74s)]
*  They're inborn. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5055.94s)]
*  We can hone them, and we need to, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5057.339999999999s)]
*  through practice, repetition. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5059.219999999999s)]
*  But it's very, I think it's a sign of hubris, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5061.259999999999s)]
*  which is always the death of, particularly of men, hubris, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5065.58s)]
*  thinking you have more power than you do. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5068.62s)]
*  When mid-life, you're like, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5070.54s)]
*  well, actually, what I really wanna do is direct. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5072.259999999999s)]
*  It's like, you just won best actress, honey. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5074.139999999999s)]
*  Go back to acting. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5075.98s)]
*  And I've never been involved in politics. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5077.54s)]
*  I haven't even voted in all elections. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5080.54s)]
*  I'm serious. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5082.9s)]
*  So the idea that I'm going to, at 54, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5084.1s)]
*  run for national office, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5087.22s)]
*  I, as a little, you know what I mean? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5088.78s)]
*  I don't take myself quite that seriously. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5091.74s)]
*  I can't imagine doing something like that. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5093.98s)]
*  I'm just being honest. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5095.94s)]
*  The reason I ask this question is that if we're, [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5096.78s)]
*  at least the Republicans will now prove [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5098.5s)]
*  that we've lived in a 12-year era [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5102.0199999999995s)]
*  of a non-traditional candidate. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5104.66s)]
*  That was essentially a media personality [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5106.22s)]
*  that was able to then curate a plurality of support, right? [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5108.66s)]
*  And there's gonna be something that comes after him. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5112.22s)]
*  And so I'm just trying to get a sense of, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5115.0599999999995s)]
*  if it's not you, it's probably, to be very honest, [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5117.38s)]
*  somebody like you, right? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5120.18s)]
*  Just talk to us about that for just a second. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5123.34s)]
*  I completely agree with you. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5126.0599999999995s)]
*  And I love your characterization of Trump [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5127.5s)]
*  as someone who's from a media background, [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5129.9s)]
*  because that's closer to the, [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5131.22s)]
*  I'm not diminishing, I'm from media backgrounds. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5132.7s)]
*  I'm not attacking it, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5134.3s)]
*  but that's a lot closer to the truth [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5135.139999999999s)]
*  than most characterizations, casino magnet, developer. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5137.86s)]
*  He's a media guy. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5141.86s)]
*  You know, he had lots of businesses, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5142.7s)]
*  but he was a media guy. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5144.5s)]
*  He had the top show in NBC. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5145.46s)]
*  And so I think you're absolutely right. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5147.38s)]
*  My concern is, and I have pure contempt [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5150.099999999999s)]
*  for the professional and political class. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5153.94s)]
*  I've written a book about it. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5155.86s)]
*  I've expressed it daily for a number of years now, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5156.9s)]
*  and it's real. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5158.98s)]
*  However, I think that they're, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5160.0599999999995s)]
*  you know, these are complex systems, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5163.0599999999995s)]
*  and it's better to have someone who understands the systems [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5164.78s)]
*  in an ideal world administer the systems, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5167.06s)]
*  because he's more effective at doing so. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5169.660000000001s)]
*  And I also think that once you decide that like, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5171.780000000001s)]
*  hey, let's just go crazy, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5176.26s)]
*  and you couple that with true social disorder, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5178.620000000001s)]
*  like you get to a place where you can't buy anything at CVS [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5183.26s)]
*  because it's chained up, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5185.9800000000005s)]
*  because shoplifting has been legalized, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5187.06s)]
*  as it has been in California. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5189.1s)]
*  What you're going to get is fascism, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5191.1s)]
*  because people can't live in that, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5193.54s)]
*  they can't live with chaos. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5196.5s)]
*  That's the one thing they can't deal with, [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5197.66s)]
*  and I've covered a couple of wars, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5198.820000000001s)]
*  and that was my main conclusion. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5199.9800000000005s)]
*  The main problem with war is not that people get killed, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5201.66s)]
*  it's that people have to live with total uncertainty [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5204.26s)]
*  and craziness, and that's incompatible with what people want. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5206.58s)]
*  Like that's the worst thing. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5210.06s)]
*  You know, we're all gonna die. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5211.820000000001s)]
*  Dying is not the worst thing. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5212.9400000000005s)]
*  The worst thing is living in chaos, [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5214.38s)]
*  and we're starting to live in chaos. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5216.74s)]
*  And so the return to order is what scares me. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5218.78s)]
*  I think it'd be very easy, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5221.46s)]
*  and I do think Gavin Newsom is a fascist. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5222.38s)]
*  I think he's the kind of person who would have no problem, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5224.02s)]
*  no hesitation about using the DOJ [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5225.7s)]
*  to imprison his political opponents. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5229.34s)]
*  Now Biden is imprisoning his political opponents, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5231.179999999999s)]
*  but at least they're lying about it. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5233.42s)]
*  Gavin Newsom is the kind of person who'd be like, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5235.22s)]
*  well yeah, you're a threat to the general order [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5236.9s)]
*  and you're going to jail. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5239.38s)]
*  And I think because we're in a moment of chaos right now, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5240.82s)]
*  people kind of want that, actually. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5244.74s)]
*  I think one of the purposes of degrading [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5246.82s)]
*  and confusing our society is to make way for authoritarianism, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5248.94s)]
*  even more than we have now. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5253.179999999999s)]
*  So that kind of freaks me out, actually. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5255.5s)]
*  I personally, what I would really like [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5257.82s)]
*  is a kind of colorless, boring, non-charismatic, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5260.7s)]
*  like Gerald Ford, Mike Pence, without their views. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5266.46s)]
*  Both of those men were bad men, in my opinion. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5270.78s)]
*  But someone like that who could govern [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5273.14s)]
*  without making it about himself [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5275.78s)]
*  and restore the country to a sense of rules-based order. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5277.82s)]
*  That's what I really want. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5282.3s)]
*  But I'm probably going to be denied that. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5284.1s)]
*  Tucker, I feel like one of the other consequences [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5285.700000000001s)]
*  of the way things have gone is that the solution [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5289.46s)]
*  has always been to throw more money at the problem [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5291.26s)]
*  and we've got this kind of out-of-control fiscal condition. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5293.02s)]
*  What's your point of view on the fiscal condition [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5296.14s)]
*  of the US as a priority, [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5298.54s)]
*  the federal government that is as a priority? [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5300.9800000000005s)]
*  And do we need to shrink government, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5303.3s)]
*  shrink overall discretionary spending? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5307.14s)]
*  Do we need to cut these entitlements? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5308.9400000000005s)]
*  Do we need to do it all? [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5310.26s)]
*  And how do we get there, given that everyone gets elected, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5311.58s)]
*  by telling people, I'm going to give you more stuff? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5315.66s)]
*  And then this just kind of cascades for decades [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5318.38s)]
*  until eventually bad shit happens. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5320.98s)]
*  Well, who's going to buy our debt? [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5323.34s)]
*  I mean, that's like, it's scary. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5324.66s)]
*  It's so scary. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5326.78s)]
*  You know, this is, of course, the problem with democracy. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5329.22s)]
*  I mean, I think since, you know, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5331.58s)]
*  from the Roman Republican until 1776, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5332.7s)]
*  like how many democracies were there? [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5335.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5336.9s)]
*  Yeah. Exactly. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5337.74s)]
*  Let me just do the math on that. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5339.1s)]
*  Approximately zero in that range. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5340.42s)]
*  And this was the critique, of course, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5342.38s)]
*  in Europe of democracy at the time, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5345.1s)]
*  is not that it gave too much freedom to the average person, [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5347.3s)]
*  but that it would result in tyranny. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5350.900000000001s)]
*  And when the majority discovered it could steal the goods [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5354.46s)]
*  of whomever it wanted legally, legally, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5357.9400000000005s)]
*  you would wind up with dictatorship. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5361.46s)]
*  I mean, this is like a very well-trod path, [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5363.62s)]
*  but I mean, I hope it doesn't get to that. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5365.7s)]
*  I'm not making an argument against democracy. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5367.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm just saying it's a little bit harder to perpetuate [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5369.38s)]
*  than we thought that it was. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5372.5s)]
*  And this is kind of the fear that people have had [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5374.54s)]
*  for hundreds of years that we wind up here. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5377.78s)]
*  The fiscal condition is the manifestation [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5378.62s)]
*  of that structural problem. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5380.9800000000005s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5382.26s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5383.1s)]
*  Let's end on this Elon clip from yesterday, [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5385.62s)]
*  just about virtue. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5388.62s)]
*  I'd like to get your reaction to this, Tucker. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5390.3s)]
*  Tesla has done more to help the environment [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5392.34s)]
*  than all other companies combined. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5394.900000000001s)]
*  It would be fair to say that therefore, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5399.58s)]
*  as a leader of the company, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5401.22s)]
*  I've done more for the environment than everyone [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5402.38s)]
*  and any single human on earth. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5404.34s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5406.78s)]
*  How do I feel about that? [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5410.34s)]
*  Yeah, no, I'm asking you personally [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5411.34s)]
*  how you feel about that, [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5412.9800000000005s)]
*  because we're talking about power and influence. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5413.82s)]
*  I'm saying what I care about is the reality of goodness, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5416.62s)]
*  not the perception of it. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5419.7s)]
*  And what I see all over the place [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5421.86s)]
*  is people who care about looking good while doing evil. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5423.78s)]
*  Fuck them. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5427.9400000000005s)]
*  Your thoughts on virtue signaling versus reality. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5429.06s)]
*  It was like the hand of God [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5432.3s)]
*  massaging my central nervous system, [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5435.5s)]
*  like every erogenous zone, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5437.3s)]
*  which is just heightened awareness. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5439.5s)]
*  That, I couldn't believe. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5441.620000000001s)]
*  It's a full chiropractic release. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5444.02s)]
*  So dirty, I'm sorry. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5447.14s)]
*  No, but I so vehemently agree, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5448.34s)]
*  and I don't even like electric cars. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5450.780000000001s)]
*  I don't think they help the environment. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5452.700000000001s)]
*  I didn't even agree with that part. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5453.860000000001s)]
*  I just love his point, which is the point. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5455.820000000001s)]
*  Which is what actually matters is what you do. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5459.18s)]
*  It's not what you think. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5462.42s)]
*  What matters is helping other people. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5463.740000000001s)]
*  And I also think that the fact that Andrew Ross Sorkin [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5465.9400000000005s)]
*  has a television job shows this is not a meritocracy. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5468.9800000000005s)]
*  Like, I don't know how he got that. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5472.22s)]
*  Clearly, that was my thought. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5473.06s)]
*  His response to that was like, he didn't even, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5475.38s)]
*  he can't even, like, I'll just kind of say, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5477.780000000001s)]
*  this is like so inside baseball, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5479.780000000001s)]
*  but it's literally what I do for a living, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5482.02s)]
*  I have done all my life. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5483.540000000001s)]
*  Yes, that's what we do, Tucker. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5484.38s)]
*  You and I do this. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5485.42s)]
*  The key to interviewing people, yes, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5486.26s)]
*  is to listen to them. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5488.14s)]
*  Larry King, I used to fill in for Larry King at CNN. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5489.46s)]
*  He was number one, 9 p.m., all this stuff. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5491.860000000001s)]
*  The first time I filled in for Larry King, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5493.9400000000005s)]
*  there was no research on the guests. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5495.660000000001s)]
*  I had two guests, no research. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5497.18s)]
*  And I said to the producer, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5498.3s)]
*  Larry was like in Cabo with wife number seven, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5499.26s)]
*  and I said, where's the research? [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5501.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, Larry doesn't do research. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5503.38s)]
*  So I do the show, it went fine, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5505.14s)]
*  and I called him after, I was like, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5506.38s)]
*  dude, you do no research? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5507.3s)]
*  He goes, and he was number one, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5509.26s)]
*  most dominant figure in cable news by far, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5510.700000000001s)]
*  and he goes, no, I just listen. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5513.22s)]
*  And when someone says something weird, I pause, [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5516.14s)]
*  and I say, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5517.94s)]
*  You killed someone in 1962, why'd you kill him? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5519.82s)]
*  You follow up? [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5522.78s)]
*  You're present in the interview, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5524.7s)]
*  and then you follow up based on what this guest said. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5527.139999999999s)]
*  Notice how Jason's interrupting you right now. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5529.339999999999s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead, Tucker. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5530.9s)]
*  No, I love it. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5531.74s)]
*  I love it. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5532.58s)]
*  Listening to what Tucker said [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5533.4s)]
*  and reflecting back to what he said, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5534.24s)]
*  which is what the game realizes is game. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5535.08s)]
*  That's right, it's a colloquy. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5537.339999999999s)]
*  J. Cal's treating this as validation. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5539.58s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5542.0599999999995s)]
*  There's actually a lot of story to this, Tucker, [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5542.9s)]
*  that you don't need to know about. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5544.419999999999s)]
*  I can tell it's tantalizing. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5545.74s)]
*  Oh, it is, it is, trust me. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5549.179999999999s)]
*  Well, let's end here. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5551.179999999999s)]
*  We have a lot of fans of not only, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5552.7s)]
*  there's about 18% crossover between All In [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5555.219999999999s)]
*  and your work, Tucker, and they send me images [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5557.9s)]
*  of you out there and about in the world, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5560.78s)]
*  and I just got this one in my DMs. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5563.98s)]
*  I don't know what's going on here. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5567.86s)]
*  Is that a parking lot? [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5569.98s)]
*  I'm sure where you guys are. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5571.099999999999s)]
*  The bromance is complete. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5573.58s)]
*  You haven't run out of these yet? [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5574.46s)]
*  That is so, you know what? [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5576.1s)]
*  That's kind of hunky, I'm just being honest. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5579.02s)]
*  It's a lot going on here. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5581.46s)]
*  Well, listen, we got a wrap. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5582.54s)]
*  It's like a Vineyard Vines t-shirt. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5583.38s)]
*  See, the bromance is now complete. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5585.3s)]
*  Tucker, we'd love to have you back on a regular basis. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5587.7s)]
*  Actually, I think you- That was so fun. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5590.14s)]
*  That was super fun. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5591.82s)]

*  Be Tucker's sub. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5616.54s)]
*  Didn't come out exactly how I wanted it to, but- [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5618.66s)]
*  Easy, there. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5621.179999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5622.0199999999995s)]
*  You can sub for Tucker. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5622.86s)]

*  Are you subbing? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5626.54s)]
*  I'm gonna dom for Tucker. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5628.7s)]
*  Oh, God! [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5629.98s)]
*  Poor Tucker. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5632.259999999999s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5633.58s)]
*  See you guys. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5634.860000000001s)]
*  What'd you guys think? [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5636.42s)]
*  That was fun. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5637.26s)]
*  That was great. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5638.1s)]
*  Yeah, let's show a deep- [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5638.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm a sucker for Tucker, I'll be honest. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5639.76s)]
*  Can we get him on group chat? [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5641.18s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine being on group chat with Tucker? [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5642.18s)]
*  Such a fun guy. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5644.5s)]
*  Great guy. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5645.900000000001s)]
*  He's a great entertainer, and you know what? [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5646.740000000001s)]
*  I know he's right wing, conservative, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5648.740000000001s)]
*  but he's actually, I think, a first principle thinker [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5650.14s)]
*  who thinks for himself. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5652.46s)]
*  We didn't get into January 6th, we ran out of time, [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5653.34s)]
*  but he was not happy about that. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5655.22s)]
*  He wasn't happy about election denial. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5659.02s)]
*  I think he's intellectually rigorous. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5660.58s)]
*  Wow, J. Cal. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5662.02s)]
*  What'd you think, Shambhap? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5663.86s)]
*  I really liked it. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5664.7s)]
*  I like talking to people that have opinions [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5665.54s)]
*  that force me to actually rethink about how I think. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5666.98s)]
*  And it was, I think, the most impactful thing [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5671.299999999999s)]
*  that he said to me, which touches upon my own life, [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5675.379999999999s)]
*  was just how one feels when you have a little bit [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5679.419999999999s)]
*  too much too early versus grinding slowly [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5683.7s)]
*  and compounding success over many years. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5686.66s)]
*  I think it does create, in moments, [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5689.259999999999s)]
*  an element of self-sabotage. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5692.74s)]
*  I've lived it in my own life, so that totally resonated. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5694.139999999999s)]
*  This idea that there's just so much abundance [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5697.379999999999s)]
*  that causes people to not really fight over the big issues [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5700.219999999999s)]
*  and then fight over the fringe issues. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5704.82s)]
*  I do think that there's an element of huge truth in that. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5706.86s)]
*  It was really, really good. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5709.78s)]
*  I think this is probably one of the very few ones [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5711.419999999999s)]
*  that we've done that I would listen to over and over again. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5715.179999999999s)]
*  I'd say that was one of my favorite episodes, [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5718.179999999999s)]
*  or probably my favorite episode. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5719.98s)]
*  Definitely a top five favorite episode for me. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5720.82s)]
*  Just as a listener, I just enjoyed listening [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5722.7s)]
*  the whole fucking time. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5724.139999999999s)]
*  This is the thing, I just wanted to, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5724.98s)]
*  I could hear him talk for hours probably. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5726.139999999999s)]
*  I know. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5727.86s)]
*  I didn't wanna talk, I didn't have anything to say. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5728.7s)]
*  I just wanted to chill and hang out and listen. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5729.54s)]
*  Me too. It was great. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5731.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5731.94s)]
*  Have you done Tucker's show, Chamath, yet? [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5732.78s)]
*  They asked me to do the show in December, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5735.139999999999s)]
*  which I couldn't do. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5737.259999999999s)]
*  And at some point in the spring, I will do the show, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5738.7s)]
*  but then I was like, can you come on our show? [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5740.58s)]
*  And he was like, yeah. Sure. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5743.38s)]
*  There you go. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5744.219999999999s)]
*  I'm doing it right. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5745.0599999999995s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5745.88s)]
*  Yeah, that was amazing. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5746.719999999999s)]
*  Sext, didn't you go on his show? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5747.5599999999995s)]
*  No, I've been on Tucker's show a couple of times [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5749.22s)]
*  when it was on Fox, and one appearance was about [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5750.900000000001s)]
*  Chase Boudin, the DA that we got tossed out. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5753.54s)]
*  And then- [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5756.58s)]
*  Go team. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5757.42s)]
*  I went on a couple other times, I think. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5758.26s)]
*  One was about the economy. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5760.3s)]
*  I was on the show a couple of times, short segments. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5761.7s)]
*  But anyway, I thought what was interesting [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5764.46s)]
*  about this conversation was that it was much more [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5766.18s)]
*  philosophical than I was expecting. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5768.3s)]
*  Yes. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5770.5s)]
*  We touched on a few policy issues, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5771.34s)]
*  but we spent most of the time talking about [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5774.34s)]
*  his deeper clinical diagnosis of American culture [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5776.94s)]
*  and American discourse. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5781.78s)]
*  And I would say that one of the things that's maybe unique [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5784.82s)]
*  about his take, and I mean, definitely different than mine, [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5787.419999999999s)]
*  is it's much more psychological than- [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5790.379999999999s)]
*  Metaphysical even. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5793.419999999999s)]
*  Metaphysical and psychological. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5794.66s)]
*  I mean, I don't really ask too many questions [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5795.78s)]
*  about why people believe what they believe. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5799.219999999999s)]
*  I just sort of take it as a given [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5801.259999999999s)]
*  and then discuss whether they're right or wrong. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5802.5s)]
*  Whereas he actually sort of psychoanalyzes [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5804.94s)]
*  why people have the views that they have. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5807.86s)]
*  And you know what I mean? [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5811.179999999999s)]
*  It's actually kind of interesting. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5813.299999999999s)]
*  That whole methodology, for whatever it's worth, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5814.86s)]
*  resonates with me. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5816.78s)]
*  I mean, I think it's the reason early on [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5817.62s)]
*  I really gravitated to Rene Girard [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5820.099999999999s)]
*  because I thought it demonstrated a lot [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5821.9s)]
*  of how people behave to me in a language [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5823.379999999999s)]
*  that I could understand. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5825.7s)]
*  So when Tucker describes problems in this context, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5826.54s)]
*  to me it's very powerful just because [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5829.78s)]
*  that is how I kind of frame things. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5831.379999999999s)]
*  I think humans are driven by psychological incentives. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5833.94s)]
*  And I think that there is something [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5837.219999999999s)]
*  very worth exploring here, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5840.0199999999995s)]
*  which is these Western cultures get so prosperous [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5841.46s)]
*  that the big things we don't fight over, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5845.419999999999s)]
*  so then we fight over the little things, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5847.139999999999s)]
*  or we have to invent things to fight over. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5848.58s)]
*  And the virtue signaling he kind of brings up [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5850.379999999999s)]
*  in his own personal experience, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5852.259999999999s)]
*  which is, hey, I go to Jackson Hole, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5853.419999999999s)]
*  I'm getting accosted in line at the Lyft. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5854.94s)]
*  People's wives are upset at me, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5857.7s)]
*  the husbands are upset at me, the hedge fund people. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5859.0199999999995s)]
*  These are all people of incredible wealth, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5860.86s)]
*  incredible privilege who have extra cycles. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5862.78s)]
*  And instead of having a debate over the issues [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5864.66s)]
*  in good faith, full contact debate like we do here, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5868.3s)]
*  they just want to vilify people. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5872.179999999999s)]
*  And I tried to listen to him and say, [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5873.34s)]
*  hey, what does he get right here? [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5875.0199999999995s)]
*  Now, I obviously think he's wrong about climate change. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5876.98s)]
*  I thought that was bonkers, [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5878.98s)]
*  but I do think he understands human nature pretty well [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5880.3s)]
*  from doing 30 years of interviews. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5882.98s)]
*  It's definitely worth exploring, Jason, [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5885.5s)]
*  this idea that the more successful people get, [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5887.0199999999995s)]
*  the more self-loathing there is. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5889.62s)]
*  And then it manifests in some really destructive ways. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5892.02s)]
*  I think that- [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5895.26s)]
*  Especially if you don't have a foundation. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5896.1s)]
*  Once you get successful enough, there's very little progress. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5896.9400000000005s)]
*  I think a lot of human happiness comes from progress. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5899.700000000001s)]
*  Progress, exactly. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5902.14s)]
*  What, purpose? [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5903.540000000001s)]
*  Right, where's the purpose? [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5904.38s)]
*  Well, there's just no higher order bits. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5906.14s)]
*  You buy the house, that's a huge accomplishment. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5908.620000000001s)]
*  But then when you buy your second house or third house, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5910.9400000000005s)]
*  I think the diminishing returns are severe. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5913.42s)]
*  Yeah, severe. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5915.780000000001s)]
*  And then these things are just baggage. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5916.620000000001s)]
*  They're like albatrosses. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5918.620000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, and then you're spending all this time [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5919.46s)]
*  dealing with headaches. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5920.78s)]
*  You know, what's your progress? [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5921.94s)]
*  What's your progress? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5924.099999999999s)]
*  What's the purpose of life? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5924.94s)]
*  I mean, Sachs, when you bought your sixth house, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5925.78s)]
*  I mean, how did you do it? [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5927.54s)]
*  You can cut that. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5928.38s)]
*  Yeah, it's just busy reorganizing [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5930.86s)]
*  the US political establishment. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5932.7s)]
*  So I think he's making progress, you know, in his own way. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5934.259999999999s)]
*  Sachs is making progress. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5936.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5937.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5938.46s)]
*  Well, you know, he's... [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5939.3s)]
*  Where does he sit on the political spectrum today, Sachs? [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5941.9s)]
*  Because you and he are both- [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5944.58s)]
*  Tucker? [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5946.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, because you're both kind of outcasts [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5946.98s)]
*  in the Republican party now, right? [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5948.5s)]
*  I would describe Tucker as probably [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5950.26s)]
*  the most influential populist on the right. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5952.54s)]
*  So there's a sort of populism- [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5958.18s)]
*  So populist right? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5959.14s)]
*  Well, there's a populism of the left [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5960.14s)]
*  that I guess was Bernie Sanders [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5961.860000000001s)]
*  before he told, you know, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5964.18s)]
*  maybe like five, eight years ago or whatever. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5966.26s)]
*  Describe for the audience your perception of populism [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5968.34s)]
*  on the left and the right and what they share [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5972.34s)]
*  and what they don't share kind of thing. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5974.3s)]
*  Because this does seem to be the emerging party, [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5976.02s)]
*  I think we would all agree, [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5978.82s)]
*  is that people are sick of these extremes [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5980.34s)]
*  and they want something new. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5982.179999999999s)]
*  And the something new seems to be populism. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5983.58s)]
*  Well, one way to think about populism is just democracy. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5987.299999999999s)]
*  Populism is the word that the elite gives [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5991.9s)]
*  to democracy they don't like. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5994.42s)]
*  So for example, vast majority of the country, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5996.139999999999s)]
*  once our border is sealed, [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=5999.0599999999995s)]
*  for some reason the elites don't want that. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6001.0199999999995s)]
*  So that's labeled populism. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6002.94s)]
*  I think the vast majority of the country [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6004.98s)]
*  regrets the forever wars in the Middle East [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6006.62s)]
*  and doesn't want us getting involved in more wars, [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6008.78s)]
*  this sort of hyper interventionism. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6011.82s)]
*  I think that's like a major part of the platform. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6013.98s)]
*  And then of course, I think the third big area [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6017.3s)]
*  of reevaluation was around our free trade policies. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6019.46s)]
*  You know, they really ended up hollowing out [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6022.18s)]
*  America's industrial capability [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6025.62s)]
*  and exported a lot of manufacturing jobs. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6027.22s)]
*  Globalization. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6029.5s)]
*  To China, globalization. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6030.9s)]
*  So yeah, I think on the right, [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6032.7s)]
*  big picture, I would say that populism [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6035.22s)]
*  is a nationalist reaction to the hyper globalization [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6037.06s)]
*  that happened that was encouraged by the elites [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6041.9800000000005s)]
*  over the past few decades. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6043.9400000000005s)]
*  And he hit on that. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6045.02s)]
*  He said, you know, at some point, [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6046.06s)]
*  are the politicians gonna match what the people want? [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6047.9800000000005s)]
*  And they call this getting to Denmark. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6052.06s)]
*  High functioning governments in the Nordics, [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6054.66s)]
*  you know, tend to reflect what, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6058.1s)]
*  the candidates reflect what the people want, right? [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6060.900000000001s)]
*  And we seem to have this kind of broken here. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6063.94s)]
*  We have one other story people have wanted us to comment on [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6066.5s)]
*  when we had our week off. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6068.78s)]
*  So I thought we'd get into the open eye thing. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6070.62s)]
*  I just wanted to point out, [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6072.099999999999s)]
*  I don't mean to make this like a love triangle, Sax, [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6073.46s)]
*  but Tucker and I did go skiing last year. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6075.9s)]
*  We tried to keep it, but now that it's out, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6078.98s)]
*  you know, here it is. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6081.22s)]
*  I'm sorry about this, [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6083.099999999999s)]
*  but we were actually in Niseko at the same time. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6083.94s)]
*  So it's gonna come out at some point, Sax. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6086.5s)]
*  We might as well talk about it. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6088.82s)]
*  Look how old and nasty those ski clothes are. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6090.18s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know what? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6094.02s)]
*  We're both very woke and we don't want, [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6095.06s)]
*  we're a virtue signaling that we don't, we wanna recycle. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6097.66s)]
*  So we bought all this, [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6099.9800000000005s)]
*  on eBay. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6103.18s)]
*  I thought that was Phil Helmeath on the left. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6104.02s)]
*  I guess that's not J. Cal. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6105.9400000000005s)]
*  That's me before I was Zempigface. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6107.46s)]
*  All right, let's do the open eye AI thing. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6109.22s)]
*  If you guys have time, can we go over this real quick? [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6111.700000000001s)]
*  I don't wanna- [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6114.3s)]
*  We can, I just wonder if the story's stale, but. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6115.14s)]
*  I mean, I think one of the things we can do here [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6117.46s)]
*  now that the three acts are complete, [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6120.74s)]
*  we can actually talk about the epilogue [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6123.66s)]
*  just for people who don't listen to the news. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6125.38s)]
*  I think the epilogue's about to drop, but. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6128.58s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's what we'll get at. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6131.0599999999995s)]
*  I think we're still in the second act here. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6132.98s)]
*  I don't think this is over by long shot. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6135.179999999999s)]
*  All right, so let me architect this. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6136.82s)]
*  That's interesting, let's see why. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6137.66s)]
*  I'm curious why that is. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6138.58s)]
*  I'm gonna architect and then I'm gonna hand it to you, Juma. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6139.9s)]
*  Act one, Sam's fired. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6141.86s)]
*  Act two, chaos for a week, we were off. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6143.099999999999s)]
*  What were all the reasons? [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6145.94s)]
*  Act three, obviously, just yesterday, Sam's back. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6147.0199999999995s)]
*  I think Ilya's out, Microsoft's an observer on the board. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6150.46s)]
*  So I guess the epilogue, Juma, [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6152.0599999999995s)]
*  is what we wanna know is what happened. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6154.0199999999995s)]
*  Why did this all happen? [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6156.74s)]
*  Was there a major breakthrough? [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6157.74s)]
*  Was it Sam doing deals with Masayoshi-san [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6159.42s)]
*  or in the Middle East to make AI chips? [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6162.54s)]
*  What do you, if the epilogue does drop, [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6166.22s)]
*  or if like you're saying, this is the second act [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6170.0199999999995s)]
*  and the third act's gonna begin, [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6171.7s)]
*  whichever metaphor you wanna use, [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6173.18s)]
*  what will it say, Juma? [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6175.42s)]
*  I think we can all agree on what happened, [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6176.94s)]
*  which is that the employees realized [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6179.54s)]
*  that in the absence of leadership, business leadership, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6182.46s)]
*  that the enterprise value of that company [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6185.379999999999s)]
*  was going to disintegrate. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6188.62s)]
*  And what would have been imperiled [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6190.339999999999s)]
*  was an $86 billion valuation secondary. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6193.9s)]
*  So I think the employees did what was in their best interests [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6197.299999999999s)]
*  and it makes the obvious and logical sense, [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6202.379999999999s)]
*  which is we need to circle the wagons [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6205.78s)]
*  and get the business leadership of this company [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6208.66s)]
*  back into this place so that the value of the enterprise [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6210.66s)]
*  is sustained. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6215.3s)]
*  They did that. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6216.66s)]
*  So I think this valuation is gonna hold. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6217.7s)]
*  I think the secondary is going to happen. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6221.179999999999s)]
*  So I think like from that perspective, [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6222.86s)]
*  whatever was supposed to happen there happened. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6225.9s)]
*  So what are the interesting threads that are left over? [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6229.94s)]
*  We don't yet have a full accounting [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6234.1s)]
*  of what precipitated all of the decision-making [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6236.660000000001s)]
*  at the board, number one. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6240.780000000001s)]
*  Number two is the person who seemed to be [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6243.38s)]
*  the principal inventor is now no longer on the board [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6245.9800000000005s)]
*  and I think based on Sam's blog post [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6250.3s)]
*  could probably no longer be at the company. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6253.38s)]
*  That seems like an important thing. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6256.06s)]
*  And then the third thing which I found odd [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6259.22s)]
*  was Brett Taylor, who I worked with at Facebook, [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6261.62s)]
*  who I've known for a long time, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6264.219999999999s)]
*  very sober, reasonable guy, [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6265.42s)]
*  puts out his own addendum to the blog post [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6269.339999999999s)]
*  that basically says his chairmanship of this board [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6273.66s)]
*  is purely transitory. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6277.0199999999995s)]
*  What do you take from that? [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6279.9s)]
*  My takeaway is whatever's happening is still TBD. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6282.9s)]
*  There's enough question marks that, look, [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6286.5s)]
*  I told my friends on the board [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6288.62s)]
*  without saying who it was, whatever you guys do, [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6290.26s)]
*  the most important thing that you need to do [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6293.34s)]
*  is you need to retain great counsel [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6295.7s)]
*  and make sure that there, and I said this publicly, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6297.46s)]
*  make sure that there's phenomenal DNO insurance [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6299.74s)]
*  and make sure that there aren't any issues [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6303.06s)]
*  where you could be held personally liable [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6307.02s)]
*  for whatever happens in the future. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6309.1s)]
*  Piercing of the valve, the corporate valve, yeah. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6310.780000000001s)]
*  Now, that's a generic thing [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6313.14s)]
*  that I think all corporate directors should do. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6314.66s)]
*  I think it's even more important here [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6317.3s)]
*  because you have a non-standard governance structure [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6319.26s)]
*  that could change, and it could change [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6323.7s)]
*  because the people involved want it to change, [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6326.26s)]
*  but it also could change because the government says, [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6329.1s)]
*  hey, hold on a second, this should never have been [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6331.9800000000005s)]
*  like this in the first place. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6333.820000000001s)]
*  I'll give you an example of that. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6334.780000000001s)]
*  At Facebook, there was a moment where we divested [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6337.3s)]
*  all of our IP to a subsidiary in Ireland, [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6339.820000000001s)]
*  and for tax reasons, and there were two signatories [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6343.18s)]
*  to that deal, it was me and Zuck. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6346.820000000001s)]
*  And six or seven years later, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6349.66s)]
*  this is long after I left Facebook, [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6351.66s)]
*  the IRS says, hold on a second, [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6353.1s)]
*  you misvalued these assets, [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6354.5s)]
*  we're owed X billions of dollars in taxes. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6356.22s)]
*  It was a huge, long drawn out thing. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6358.74s)]
*  So at a minimum, if there's great value created here, [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6362.18s)]
*  there will be consequences with respect to tax [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6365.820000000001s)]
*  and who paid what, and if you have the shielding [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6368.860000000001s)]
*  of a nonprofit entity, there's theoretically a lot of taxes [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6372.3s)]
*  that could have been paid that month. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6375.26s)]
*  So all of this to me says a lot of really open, [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6376.1s)]
*  curious threads, which means it's not the epilogue yet. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6379.660000000001s)]
*  We're probably somewhere at the end of Act Two. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6382.820000000001s)]
*  Friedberg, my question to you is there's been speculation [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6385.34s)]
*  that there was a super intelligence, AGI breakthrough [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6389.3s)]
*  possibly, and that's what spooked everybody, [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6393.14s)]
*  and maybe the claim that Sam wasn't forthcoming [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6395.22s)]
*  with the board was that he didn't tell them about it. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6399.1s)]
*  The second thing was there's been some 4chan posts. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6401.1s)]
*  Again, this is pure speculation. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6403.860000000001s)]
*  That maybe the AI they're working on could break [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6407.06s)]
*  in some way encryption, and that would have been, [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6410.580000000001s)]
*  caused a really chaotic global moment. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6413.620000000001s)]
*  What are your thoughts on those three potential items [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6416.46s)]
*  or more, or any of those possibilities in your mind, Dave? [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6419.820000000001s)]
*  Friedberg? [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6424.02s)]
*  No idea. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6424.860000000001s)]
*  I can take a shot at that. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6425.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead, Zach. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6426.9800000000005s)]
*  Go ahead, Zach, you take a shot. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6428.14s)]
*  So I think the best theory on what actually happened here, [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6429.18s)]
*  what precipitated all of this, was broken [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6432.14s)]
*  in a piece by Reuters, and what it said was that [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6435.06s)]
*  there was a letter to the board that was written [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6439.700000000001s)]
*  in the few days before Sam's firing by the board, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6441.700000000001s)]
*  in which they were raising concerns [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6446.14s)]
*  over the development of Q-Star, [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6447.42s)]
*  which was a new breakthrough at OpenAI [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6449.580000000001s)]
*  that allows these language models to do math. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6452.780000000001s)]
*  And previously, LLMs just weren't very good at math. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6455.620000000001s)]
*  They would sort of predict the next word, [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6458.9800000000005s)]
*  but that wasn't actually based on mathematical reasoning. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6460.38s)]
*  Q-Star actually allows the AI to do math, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6463.34s)]
*  it understands mathematical reasoning. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6466.26s)]
*  Supposedly, the capability is only [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6468.7s)]
*  at a grade school level right now, [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6470.54s)]
*  but it is highly accurate, and it can be scaled up [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6472.26s)]
*  with more computing power. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6474.9800000000005s)]
*  And I don't think it was coincidental that Sam [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6476.5s)]
*  was supposedly in the Middle East, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6479.42s)]
*  seeking to raise billions of dollars [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6481.26s)]
*  to create a new chip company, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6482.7s)]
*  basically a new specialized chip or ASIC, [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6483.9400000000005s)]
*  to perhaps run these types of models. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6485.66s)]
*  So they were gonna scale up this capability, [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6488.34s)]
*  and what mathematical reasoning allows you to do [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6490.66s)]
*  is unlock a whole new problem set. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6494.099999999999s)]
*  So for example, in chemistry, in physics, [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6496.0599999999995s)]
*  in computer science, in cryptography. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6498.98s)]
*  In encryption. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6501.0599999999995s)]
*  In encryption, all these things, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6502.0199999999995s)]
*  mathematical reasoning underpins all of these disciplines. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6503.98s)]
*  And so it does represent a major new piece towards AGI. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6509.139999999999s)]
*  And so I think the best theory about what happened [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6515.9s)]
*  is that the board, but I'd say specifically Ilya, [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6518.5s)]
*  had a panic or moment of panic or- [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6523.66s)]
*  Concern. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6527.46s)]
*  You know, freak out or whatever, concern, whatever, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6528.3s)]
*  about this, and it combined with probably underlying [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6530.3s)]
*  concerns that the board had about Sam's other activity, [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6534.86s)]
*  because he's got his fingers in a lot of eyes here. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6537.42s)]
*  So it hits two of the three potential reasons. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6539.78s)]
*  Putting aside any personal behavior, [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6544.78s)]
*  it seems like there was no personal behavior here. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6546.3s)]
*  So it's those two, right? [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6549.46s)]
*  Right, so they fire him, but they apparently [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6550.3s)]
*  didn't really think it through at all. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6551.26s)]
*  And they didn't really think- [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6553.7s)]
*  Because they're news. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6554.54s)]
*  It's not a professional board. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6555.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6557.18s)]
*  That's constructed. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6558.02s)]
*  Well, I think Adam is very professional. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6558.86s)]
*  No, Adam is, but the other two were considered [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6560.62s)]
*  first-time board members. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6562.58s)]
*  But Ilya is a technologist, and then the two others [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6563.42s)]
*  who were from nonprofits or just not very familiar. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6565.02s)]
*  And so what happened is they took this drastic action, [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6568.22s)]
*  but didn't explain it. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6571.02s)]
*  And with each passing day, it became more glaring [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6572.02s)]
*  that they would not explain it. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6575.38s)]
*  So the pressure sort of built on the company [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6576.96s)]
*  to explain itself and provide a good justification for this. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6579.76s)]
*  And then meanwhile, I think Sam just ran [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6583.88s)]
*  a textbook counter-coup operation here. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6586.96s)]
*  I mean, they got- [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6590.08s)]
*  Hearts, emojis. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6591.32s)]
*  There was that aspect of it, but disguise behind [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6592.6s)]
*  the velvet glove of all these hearts and saying, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6596.0s)]
*  "'I love you' and all this stuff was the iron fist. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6598.24s)]
*  The iron fist was they got over 700 of the 770 [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6601.0s)]
*  OpenAI employees to sign a petition. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6606.0s)]
*  They were going with Sam, and Sam went to Microsoft [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6608.24s)]
*  and set up shop. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6611.4s)]
*  So the threat to the board was, [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6612.4s)]
*  I'm gonna take the whole company with me [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6614.32s)]
*  and set up shop over at Microsoft. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6616.44s)]
*  And that was sort of the compelling threat. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6618.68s)]
*  Basically all the employees threatened to quit [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6620.36s)]
*  and go with Sam. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6622.76s)]
*  And so the board was under immense pressure. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6623.6s)]
*  And then at the same time, you got the sense that [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6626.64s)]
*  Ilya was under a lot of personal pressure from his friends, [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6629.48s)]
*  from people he knew at the company. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6633.2s)]
*  It's not probably irrelevant that there's about to be [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6634.88s)]
*  a huge cash out. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6637.52s)]
*  There's about to be a big secondary [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6638.6s)]
*  at a $86 billion valuation. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6640.64s)]
*  So all these early employees were about to make [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6642.72s)]
*  a lot of money. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6644.96s)]
*  In any event, for all of these reasons, [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6646.08s)]
*  I don't think Ilya is motivated by money. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6648.32s)]
*  I think he's motivated by wanting to keep OpenAI intact. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6650.52s)]
*  I think that he must've had a moment where he realized, [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6653.4800000000005s)]
*  wait a second, what we've done here in throwing out Sam [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6656.400000000001s)]
*  is destroying the company. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6659.88s)]
*  And then he recanted. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6661.08s)]
*  He basically apologized and signed that petition. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6662.92s)]
*  And at that moment, it just became a fait accompli [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6665.6s)]
*  that Sam was gonna get his job back. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6667.64s)]
*  And so that's basically what happened. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6669.36s)]
*  Now, in terms of the epilogue, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6671.32s)]
*  where I disagree slightly with Trimoth is that, [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6673.72s)]
*  although they still have to form this board, [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6677.2s)]
*  they're gonna form a nine person board [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6679.32s)]
*  and they only have three members so far. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6680.8s)]
*  I think the conclusion here is, [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6683.36s)]
*  it's sort of a foregone conclusion, [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6685.88s)]
*  which is the board can never fire Sam again. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6687.24s)]
*  I mean, they're not gonna go through that again. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6690.24s)]
*  Therefore he has total control. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6693.64s)]
*  It would take a lot. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6694.84s)]
*  It would take a lot. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6695.68s)]
*  So I think that Sam has won and he's gonna consolidate [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6696.88s)]
*  his control over the company. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6700.360000000001s)]
*  By the way, I thought he already had control. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6702.04s)]
*  I thought that- [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6703.84s)]
*  Yeah, you outlined that in the previous episode. [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6704.68s)]
*  We all thought that he had control. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6706.400000000001s)]
*  Apparently he did not. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6707.68s)]
*  Do you think he makes it out and make it a for-profit? [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6708.52s)]
*  Do you think he just makes it a for-profit and then says, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6711.4400000000005s)]
*  hey, we'll give X amount of the equity or whatever [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6713.56s)]
*  to this nonprofit, but we're just gonna flip this thing [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6716.4400000000005s)]
*  and separate it out and clean up the original sin? [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6719.08s)]
*  I think apparently there's like tax problems with doing that. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6721.64s)]
*  But I think that what happens is, look, [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6723.8s)]
*  they already have this for-profit LLC entity, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6725.92s)]
*  which is where all the investors have basically [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6729.8s)]
*  put their money into and they've gotten shares [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6731.72s)]
*  or membership interests or some sort of profit interests. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6734.120000000001s)]
*  Synthetic shares, whatever you're saying. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6737.68s)]
*  Synthetic shares, phantom shares. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6738.52s)]
*  And then the vast majority of that is owned [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6740.08s)]
*  by this foundation, the nonprofit foundation [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6741.72s)]
*  that I always thought was under Sam's control, [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6744.52s)]
*  but apparently it wasn't. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6746.04s)]
*  I think it now will be. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6747.0s)]
*  I think that, I just think that what's gonna happen [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6748.360000000001s)]
*  in the next few months is that Sam will consolidate [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6751.76s)]
*  his control because he's proven that he has a total loyalty [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6752.88s)]
*  of the troops and they're behind him and there's no choice. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6757.08s)]
*  So why won't he get everything he wants? [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6760.28s)]
*  Yeah, all of the smoke, I think, leads to the fire [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6763.0s)]
*  that you point out, which is there was some great advance. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6767.48s)]
*  There was some deals going on and those things, [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6770.5599999999995s)]
*  it matches what the board said. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6773.88s)]
*  We didn't feel like we was being forthcoming with us [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6775.4s)]
*  and it could be on two issues like that. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6778.04s)]
*  It just totally makes sense. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6779.679999999999s)]
*  It locks the puzzle pieces in place. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6781.360000000001s)]
*  Dave, let's assume that they have now not only done [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6783.360000000001s)]
*  language models, predicting the next word [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6787.92s)]
*  and understanding that, but there is some reasoning [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6790.08s)]
*  going on here and they understand math [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6792.92s)]
*  and it understands how to do the next math problem. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6795.8s)]
*  I don't know if we put that under reinforcement learning. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6798.04s)]
*  It's obviously very different than language models. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6799.96s)]
*  Explain what you think if that is what's happening here [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6803.08s)]
*  with the Q project, what that could mean [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6806.08s)]
*  on a scientific basis. [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6807.96s)]
*  I don't know enough, I'm sorry. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6810.400000000001s)]
*  I got a- [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6812.040000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is why we love you, [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6812.88s)]
*  because you're honest when you don't know. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6814.040000000001s)]
*  Chamath, anything here as we wrap [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6816.320000000001s)]
*  in terms of watching this whole brouhaha? [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6818.240000000001s)]
*  I think it's probably not the end. [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6821.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6824.120000000001s)]
*  More drama. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6826.0s)]
*  I think there probably will be more drama. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6827.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a lot of drama. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6829.0s)]
*  Did you see the article this morning [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6831.360000000001s)]
*  where they started saying all the houses that Sam bought, [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6833.64s)]
*  he bought all these houses? [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6836.4800000000005s)]
*  And so I think there's a lot of investigators [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6838.04s)]
*  digging around now trying to figure out all the backstory [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6839.92s)]
*  because the board was and so forth coming with what happened [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6842.04s)]
*  and why they made this decision. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6845.16s)]
*  There's a lot of people digging around [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6847.0s)]
*  trying to figure out more about Sam [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6848.36s)]
*  than may have been looked into in the past. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6850.0s)]
*  So this will reveal all sorts of new threads [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6852.76s)]
*  that'll start to become part of the narrative. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6855.92s)]
*  It's unfortunate. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6857.92s)]
*  I think that the technology, [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6859.28s)]
*  the progress is what really matters here, [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6861.36s)]
*  not all the kind of personal people stuff, it's weird. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6864.04s)]
*  The other comment I'll make, [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6868.28s)]
*  I thought one of the biggest takeaways for me [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6869.12s)]
*  on the whole drama last week [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6870.799999999999s)]
*  was that the employees basically got their way. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6872.84s)]
*  Employees got together, voted and said, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6876.16s)]
*  this is what we want and the board did what they wanted. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6878.599999999999s)]
*  And it really, I think sets another precedent, [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6881.28s)]
*  much like, I think Elon said a really big precedent [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6883.799999999999s)]
*  in Silicon Valley when he came in [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6886.32s)]
*  and slashed heads at Twitter. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6887.639999999999s)]
*  The precedent that it triggered a lot of other executives [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6890.0s)]
*  to start to think, well, maybe that's possible [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6893.2s)]
*  and I should think about doing more cost savings and so on. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6894.96s)]
*  This is another interesting precedent [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6898.76s)]
*  where an entire employee base gets together [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6900.76s)]
*  and says, we want X and the board acquiesced [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6903.24s)]
*  and said, here you go, you can have X. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6906.72s)]
*  Does that mean that other startups and other companies [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6908.88s)]
*  are gonna start to see employee groups band together [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6911.24s)]
*  saying we want X in a more vocal public way? [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6913.72s)]
*  Possibly. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6916.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, Fieberg, this is not a new tactic. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6917.68s)]
*  But look, if the employees are willing to sign a petition [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6920.6s)]
*  on mass and you get over 90% of them supporting something [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6923.32s)]
*  and then you also threaten to all set up shop [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6926.36s)]
*  somewhere else, I mean, boards usually respond [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6930.04s)]
*  to that pressure. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6933.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6934.28s)]
*  But look, I think that it's very clear that Sam [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6935.12s)]
*  has the support of the troops, I'm not questioning that. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6937.88s)]
*  But I think it would be a mistake to just see this [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6939.92s)]
*  as some sort of spontaneous groundswell. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6942.44s)]
*  I think there was clearly like some organization to it. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6944.719999999999s)]
*  Like I said, I think he ran a textbook operation there. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6947.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6951.639999999999s)]
*  I wasn't at Paul Graham who said something like [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6952.5199999999995s)]
*  if Sam were dropped on an island of cannibals, [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6954.44s)]
*  like kind of a Lord of the fly situation, [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6957.639999999999s)]
*  he'd be the one to come out on top. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6959.2s)]
*  He's like really, he's in his element. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6962.28s)]
*  Don't just assume, look, this is all covered up by hearts [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6964.04s)]
*  and I love you. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6967.48s)]
*  I mean, I've never read a corporate announcement [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6968.32s)]
*  with the word loving it more times. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6970.2s)]
*  This was not about loving hearts. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6972.639999999999s)]
*  You know, there's some ruthless corporate infighting here. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6975.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6979.2s)]
*  And he came out on top. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6980.04s)]
*  But look, the board was totally incompetent. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6981.08s)]
*  I mean, listen, if a board is gonna take a drastic action [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6982.8s)]
*  of firing the founder CEO when everything is going great, [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6987.4s)]
*  I mean, cause everything's been going great at OpenAI, [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6992.24s)]
*  it's incumbent on them to explain their actions. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6995.32s)]
*  And there needs to be a smoking gun. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6997.32s)]
*  Why didn't they just do that? [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6998.64s)]
*  Why didn't they do that? [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=6999.88s)]
*  There needs to be a... [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7000.72s)]
*  Why didn't they do that? [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7001.92s)]
*  Even as a CYA or for their reputation? [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7003.2s)]
*  I'm saying it was totally incompetent. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7005.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7007.44s)]
*  They should have dropped it, yeah. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7008.28s)]
*  Well, no, what I'm saying is either there's a smoking gun [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7010.16s)]
*  or there's not. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7012.92s)]
*  I don't think you should take an action like this ever [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7013.76s)]
*  unless there's a smoking gun. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7016.16s)]
*  And if there is a smoking gun, you need to communicate that. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7017.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7021.16s)]
*  And I think with each passing day [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7022.0s)]
*  that they didn't communicate it, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7022.82s)]
*  people came to the conclusion there is no smoking gun. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7023.76s)]
*  And so my guess is there is no smoking gun [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7026.88s)]
*  and they were overly hasty about taking this action. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7028.64s)]
*  Yeah, this could have been a very simple discussion. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7032.76s)]
*  Hey, Sam, can we work on you telling us in advance [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7034.76s)]
*  when you're going and doing deal-making [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7038.4s)]
*  so we can be in alignment on it? [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7040.4s)]
*  Like it seemed like there was something [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7042.839999999999s)]
*  that could have been done that wasn't firing him [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7044.4s)]
*  in this explosive way. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7047.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, like you could put somebody on a PIP, [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7048.5599999999995s)]
*  you could do all kinds of things. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7051.5599999999995s)]
*  So taking the step of, yeah, letting somebody go [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7054.679999999999s)]
*  in that way with that orchestration. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7057.679999999999s)]
*  Again, I just think that this stuff is too juicy [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7060.839999999999s)]
*  and too interesting for the details to not come out. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7065.46s)]
*  Oh, it will come out, yeah. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7069.66s)]
*  The fact that it hasn't come out yet is crazy. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7070.86s)]
*  I would have suspected it would have come out [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7072.86s)]
*  in the first 72 hours. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7074.22s)]
*  So you think there is maybe not a smoking gun, [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7075.06s)]
*  but there's something. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7077.42s)]
*  No, no, no, I think it's what we said, [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7079.78s)]
*  which is that the economically rational decision [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7081.8s)]
*  for all the employees and for Sam and Greg [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7084.62s)]
*  was to do what they did because it allows them [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7087.9400000000005s)]
*  to get an $86 billion valuation [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7090.14s)]
*  and a big secondary done, right? [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7092.22s)]
*  So that makes complete rational sense. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7093.74s)]
*  That is the rational decision that should have happened. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7095.82s)]
*  And so that did, but it doesn't stop [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7100.54s)]
*  whatever underlying chaos was happening [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7103.94s)]
*  that caused this decision to exist in the first place [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7108.139999999999s)]
*  to not come out. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7111.66s)]
*  I just think that the incentives for that decision [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7113.7s)]
*  to come out now, for example, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7115.86s)]
*  from the two departing board members is quite high. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7117.58s)]
*  How do you get this information [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7120.42s)]
*  from the incoming board members? [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7121.86s)]
*  How do they not say anything? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7123.88s)]
*  All the new six people that join the board [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7125.5199999999995s)]
*  will have to get read into this thing, right? [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7127.94s)]
*  So you're just multiplying the number of people [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7130.2s)]
*  that knows whatever it is. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7132.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's either going to be, David, to your point, [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7134.88s)]
*  path A, which is the board didn't know what they're doing [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7137.139999999999s)]
*  and they acted hastily or the self-preservation [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7139.719999999999s)]
*  of here's what we knew, but it is just gonna come out [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7143.32s)]
*  and leak after leak after leak. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7145.84s)]
*  And then to your point, the pulling the sweater [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7147.2s)]
*  of all of the other deals that may have been happening [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7150.679999999999s)]
*  on the side or whatever, all of this stuff now comes out [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7153.84s)]
*  because it's just too salacious for too many people. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7155.44s)]
*  The numbers are too big. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7158.3s)]
*  Everything just looks too juicy. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7159.6s)]
*  Now you have this like hidden technology [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7161.44s)]
*  that could theoretically ruin the world. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7163.64s)]
*  Everybody will be leaking to everybody. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7166.4s)]
*  That's the only guarantee here, [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7170.44s)]
*  which is why I really think that you have to commend [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7172.74s)]
*  the leadership team for trying to become very militaristic [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7176.6s)]
*  about all of this. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7179.68s)]
*  Everybody had the same tweets. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7181.28s)]
*  They said the same things. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7183.98s)]
*  They use the same heart emojis. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7185.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, it was extremely well-managed. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7186.96s)]
*  It was monstrous. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7189.8s)]
*  It's amazing what a secondary will do to the troops [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7191.04s)]
*  and there's alignment of the stock price. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7193.84s)]
*  What was the mantra? [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7195.679999999999s)]
*  The mantra was that OpenAI is nothing without its employees [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7196.5199999999995s)]
*  or something like that. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7200.2s)]
*  Its team. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7201.04s)]
*  We are nothing without our team or something like that. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7201.88s)]
*  That was basically something that on the surface [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7203.8s)]
*  appeared to be a positive affirmation of camaraderie, [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7207.24s)]
*  but like I said, iron fist beneath a velvet glove. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7211.8s)]
*  It's a threat. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7214.84s)]
*  It's a threat. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7215.68s)]
*  We can set up shop at Microsoft. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7216.5s)]
*  It's also the formula in an Excel spreadsheet [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7217.34s)]
*  that says they are nothing without the team. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7220.08s)]
*  The enterprise value equals zero. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7222.72s)]
*  Your company is a zero without us [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7224.92s)]
*  and we can go step shop somewhere else. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7227.16s)]
*  So it was perfect velvet glove, iron fist type stuff. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7228.72s)]
*  Yeah, well done, Sam. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7232.88s)]
*  Sam will be on the pod in the coming weeks, I think. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7235.5199999999995s)]
*  I've been texting with him. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7237.44s)]
*  So I think if Sam... [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7238.28s)]
*  I think what Elon said yesterday [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7240.0s)]
*  was also really interesting, [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7241.8s)]
*  which is he described Ilya as an extremely moral person [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7242.9s)]
*  who thinks about these things subtly. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7247.84s)]
*  And so again, and I've known Adam for a long time. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7250.84s)]
*  I think Adam is tremendous. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7254.0s)]
*  He is- From Quora, Adam D'Angelo. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7256.16s)]
*  Yeah, he was the CTO at Facebook. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7258.24s)]
*  We worked together in the trenches in war for years. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7259.4s)]
*  He is just the best of the best. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7262.4s)]
*  Totally. He's very smart. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7265.759999999999s)]
*  He's so incredible. Very knowledgeable. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7267.36s)]
*  This is not an irrational, emotional person. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7269.88s)]
*  My guess is that they had good reasons [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7272.84s)]
*  to want to act based on Ilya's philosophy around AI safety. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7278.5599999999995s)]
*  You may not agree with that philosophy, [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7286.719999999999s)]
*  but their mistake was if you're gonna do something like that, [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7288.24s)]
*  you have to be able to defend it. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7292.0s)]
*  You have to be able to communicate it. [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7292.92s)]
*  And I mean, if your concern here was around AI safety, [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7294.16s)]
*  write a manifesto, [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7297.92s)]
*  explain the values that you're invoking and supporting. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7299.68s)]
*  That's right. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7303.8s)]
*  I think that's a takeaway for all of us, [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7304.639999999999s)]
*  for all of us on boards that at some point [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7306.599999999999s)]
*  have to make these decisions [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7309.44s)]
*  because we're all faced with them and we've made them. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7310.5599999999995s)]
*  The lesson that I learned is we're at a point [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7314.2s)]
*  where it is so important that you give employees [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7316.96s)]
*  the transparency to re-underwrite why they should stay. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7319.98s)]
*  So when you make a decision like this [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7323.4s)]
*  in any company going forward, [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7324.839999999999s)]
*  my reaction will be open the kimono [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7326.12s)]
*  and lay out the case bare. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7329.48s)]
*  So if you have to make a CEO transition, [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7332.04s)]
*  this is exactly why we did it. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7333.92s)]
*  This was the precipitating events that caused it. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7336.48s)]
*  Here's the evidence [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7338.92s)]
*  and here's what we're gonna do about it. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7340.4s)]
*  And I think that that's probably a good takeaway [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7341.759999999999s)]
*  for all boards to learn, [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7344.36s)]
*  which is that level of transparency [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7345.639999999999s)]
*  is gonna be needed in the future [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7347.04s)]
*  so that folks don't fill in the blanks [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7348.28s)]
*  with their own conspiracy theories. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7350.839999999999s)]
*  Also, there were apparently two companies [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7352.64s)]
*  or two organizations running in parallel here [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7355.12s)]
*  to build on your points, Jamath, [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7357.26s)]
*  which is Ilya and the nonprofit, [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7358.4800000000005s)]
*  this might have been the right decision [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7361.3s)]
*  for that organization. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7362.84s)]
*  But the right decision for the employees [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7364.6s)]
*  who are incented by this secondary [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7366.320000000001s)]
*  that was about to be shipping the employees, [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7367.9800000000005s)]
*  apparently billions of dollars, [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7371.400000000001s)]
*  that for-profit company, this would be the wrong decision. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7373.6s)]
*  The for-profit company should go fast [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7376.68s)]
*  and it should be releasing products. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7378.88s)]
*  And Jason, from what was reported, [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7381.8s)]
*  there's this obligation, [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7384.76s)]
*  and it's hard to understand what it means, [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7387.360000000001s)]
*  of the board to determine when AGI is reached [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7389.0s)]
*  and then as a result, essentially, [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7392.28s)]
*  hit the kill switch on the commercial business. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7394.84s)]
*  And if I were a board member dealing with that, [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7397.56s)]
*  I would want a gazillion trillion dollars [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7401.400000000001s)]
*  of insurance to cover me. [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7404.52s)]
*  And the reason is that when that's litigated, [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7406.8s)]
*  not if, when that's litigated, [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7409.84s)]
*  it is that board that will be at the center [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7412.72s)]
*  of dealing with that financial responsibility and liability. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7415.400000000001s)]
*  This is the other master stroke, I think, of what Sam did. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7422.42s)]
*  He's not even on the board, [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7425.28s)]
*  so that liability is no longer his. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7426.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7428.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7429.32s)]
*  Amazing. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7430.16s)]
*  So he's got complete control of the business [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7431.0s)]
*  and the actual- [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7434.08s)]
*  None of the responsibility. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7435.6s)]
*  And the actual fiscal responsibility, [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7436.96s)]
*  he doesn't have to bear. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7440.0s)]
*  Go ahead, Sam. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7440.839999999999s)]
*  Well, can I speak to the kill switch for a second? [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7441.66s)]
*  So I think it's a really interesting point. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7442.679999999999s)]
*  So by the way, Jason, there is a for-profit entity here. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7444.679999999999s)]
*  The for-profit entity is this new LLC that was created. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7447.44s)]
*  Correct. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7449.679999999999s)]
*  The non-profit entity is above it at the governance layer [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7450.5199999999995s)]
*  and it kind of owns the LLC. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7453.36s)]
*  So again, investors and employees get compensated [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7455.44s)]
*  out of the LLC, and then this non-profit foundation [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7458.639999999999s)]
*  was supposed to exercise a really complicated org chart. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7461.62s)]
*  There you go. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7463.839999999999s)]
*  Whenever an org chart has more than like two arrows, [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7464.679999999999s)]
*  it's crazy. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7467.639999999999s)]
*  You're fucked. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7468.48s)]
*  How many arrows? [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7470.18s)]
*  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight arrows. [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7471.02s)]
*  That's six too many. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7473.3s)]
*  But my point is that this complexity was justified [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7474.820000000001s)]
*  by this idea of the kill switch, [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7478.66s)]
*  that if the AI gets out of control, [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7481.12s)]
*  the AGI gets out of control, [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7483.14s)]
*  we're gonna have this board of super wise people [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7484.68s)]
*  who are not motivated by a profit incentive, right? [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7487.820000000001s)]
*  Cause that, we can't trust the profit motive, right? [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7490.1s)]
*  And so we're gonna have this board of wise elders [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7494.06s)]
*  who are going to make this super intelligent decision. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7497.62s)]
*  And if this whole episode shows anything, [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7502.3s)]
*  it shows this structure completely failed. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7504.26s)]
*  I mean, the board ended up acting [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7505.88s)]
*  in a completely incompetent way. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7508.14s)]
*  Either they had good cause to do what they did [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7509.62s)]
*  and didn't explain it, which was incompetent, [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7512.9s)]
*  or they had no cause at all, which was incompetent. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7514.86s)]
*  Either way, you cannot say that this board acted [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7517.0199999999995s)]
*  with a high degree of competence. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7520.34s)]
*  No matter how competent any of the individuals are, [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7522.0199999999995s)]
*  I'm just saying that as a board dynamic, [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7524.62s)]
*  it completely failed. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7527.22s)]
*  So they did not invent some higher form of governance [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7528.14s)]
*  as they originally claimed was necessary. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7531.38s)]
*  It's a Frankenstructure. [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7533.740000000001s)]
*  It's a Frankenstructure. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7534.9800000000005s)]
*  So it didn't work. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7535.900000000001s)]
*  And I think this all, I mean, it's a, [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7536.860000000001s)]
*  I think important lesson in human motivations, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7539.34s)]
*  which is just because you take out the profit motive [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7542.740000000001s)]
*  does not mean that human beings all of a sudden [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7545.900000000001s)]
*  become noble. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7548.62s)]
*  They just pursue other agendas, [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7549.46s)]
*  basically political agendas or whatever. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7552.1s)]
*  And so this idea that we're gonna solve the AGI problem [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7554.48s)]
*  or alignment issue by creating nonprofit structures, [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7559.959999999999s)]
*  I think that this episode proves that's not gonna work. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7563.719999999999s)]
*  Like look elsewhere. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7566.919999999999s)]
*  And you and I talked about this on Twitter spaces [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7568.4s)]
*  and X spaces, which was, people give VCs and investors [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7570.719999999999s)]
*  a hard time about, I don't know their existence [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7576.12s)]
*  and how they operate in the world. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7578.919999999999s)]
*  Okay, fair enough. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7580.78s)]
*  I'm sure there's valid criticisms, [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7581.62s)]
*  but the share price and employees participating [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7583.56s)]
*  and the share price going up [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7586.72s)]
*  and secondaries occurring on a regular basis [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7588.6s)]
*  is the most perfect structure that has been created [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7590.92s)]
*  by humans to date for running an organization. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7594.22s)]
*  I think we would all agree. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7596.92s)]
*  And it's super imperfect. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7597.84s)]
*  And there's weird things that happen. [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7598.9400000000005s)]
*  But if you want everybody to grow in the right direction, [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7600.6s)]
*  giving them some shares, [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7602.88s)]
*  and then everybody watching the share price go up [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7603.92s)]
*  and to the right is pretty phenomenal. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7605.68s)]
*  This board did not have one VC on it. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7607.860000000001s)]
*  It was not- [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7610.14s)]
*  All the VCs in the company, they were the biggest. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7610.98s)]
*  They were the most aggressive tweeters saying, [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7614.7s)]
*  WTF, like what are you doing? [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7617.98s)]
*  Cause they could see their investment going up in smoke. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7619.98s)]
*  Yes, they had alignment with the share price, [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7622.58s)]
*  but no controls. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7625.339999999999s)]
*  So as much as you don't like the profit motive, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7626.78s)]
*  it does create alignment and that makes people predictable. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7628.66s)]
*  And that's a good thing. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7632.12s)]
*  And like Adam Smith said in the 1700s, [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7633.099999999999s)]
*  the reason we can trust that the butcher [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7636.62s)]
*  will serve us our dinner [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7641.74s)]
*  is because they're gonna make a profit. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7643.86s)]
*  They're aligned with us. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7645.5s)]
*  And we don't look to charity. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7646.679999999999s)]
*  We look to their self-interest. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7648.58s)]
*  And like you said, for all the shit that VCs take, [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7650.98s)]
*  if you properly align people, it can create, [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7654.0199999999995s)]
*  I think it creates a great enterprise. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7657.099999999999s)]
*  It creates a potential for a great enterprise, [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7659.34s)]
*  for great outcomes. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7661.82s)]
*  Great outcomes, absolutely. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7662.66s)]
*  All right, this has been another extraordinary [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7663.74s)]
*  all in episode, probably top five. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7667.259999999999s)]
*  Thanks so much for Tucker Clawson [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7670.12s)]

*  We should all just get a room [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7720.52s)]
*  and just have one big huge orgy [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pLY1X46H1E&t=7721.6s)]
