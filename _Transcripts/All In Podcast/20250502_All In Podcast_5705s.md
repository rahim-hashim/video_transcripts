*  Well that was a year and a half ago so it's a distant memory for in Flexport time that's like a decade we've yeah really had an amazing run although these tariffs I mean I guess that's why you guys invited me on these tariffs who kind of made a lot of created a lot of new uncertainty into Flexport's world [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=93.60000000000001s)]

*  wouldn't be willing to accept it's only five hundred thousand dollars is what I read is that true [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  that's true for for founding members who have additional benefits but there's also a lower [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=363.28000000000003s)]
*  level that's the more reasonable membership level so I think people are getting a little [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  bit carried away with that number got it okay that's why I wanted to clarify yeah yeah there's like [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  10 founding members who have that level and then there's a lower level for a more average member [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=376.16s)]
*  Chamath you one of those 10 yes do you pay more if you have tds or how does that work tds premium [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=382.24s)]

*  for a friend it's a tds surcharge you put the tower no look it's very simple we just we want [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=394.0s)]
*  a place to hang out in dc all of us have been to clubs like the battery or I don't know if you go [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=399.44000000000005s)]
*  to la like the best places there's malibu beach houses bird street clubs there are places in palm [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=405.68s)]
*  beach they're really cool in any event we wanted a place to hang out and the the clubs that exist [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=411.92s)]
*  in washington today have been around for decades they're kind of old and stuffy to the extent there [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=418.16s)]
*  are republican clubs they tend to be like more bush era republicans as opposed to trump era [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  republicans so we wanted to create something new hipper and trump aligned since i'm in the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=429.68s)]
*  government i can't be an owner but i told him i'd be happy to be member number one and so i you know [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  so great let's do it and so we're creating a place for us to hang out that's basically it we want a [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=442.24s)]
*  place to go where you don't have to worry that the next person over at the bar is a fake news [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=446.8s)]
*  reporter or even a lobbyist or something like that who we don't know and we don't trust got it so it's [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=451.44s)]
*  like any private club you want to go somewhere that's highly curated this private club movement [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=458.8s)]
*  is happening all over the country not just washington but we're creating something that [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=466.64s)]
*  didn't exist before in dc which again is younger hipper trump aligned republican [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=470.0s)]
*  we're i i actually started a kamala club in um in the bay area so so we're yeah i don't think [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  anyone would pay to join that though it's the problem right i mean it's an open bar and that's [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=483.76s)]
*  for sure where do you guys meet up in like redwood city we actually meet up at the uh at the at the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=488.56s)]
*  trade ports all right listen we're 100 days into trump 2.0 it's just a random 100 day thing but [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=495.36s)]
*  everybody's talking about everybody's hand-wringing what has it been like for this first hundred days [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=503.36s)]
*  how does it compare to biden how does it compare to trump 1.0 143 executive orders the most [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=508.16s)]
*  ever in the first hundred days and they're moving obviously at a at a different pace to be generous [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=514.0s)]
*  major indices are down seven to ten percent obviously this trade war and tariffs the year [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=521.2s)]
*  old on the the yield on the tenure that's down about 40 basis points there's a lot going on let's [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=527.5200000000001s)]
*  go around the horn ryan aran you're our guest what's your take on the first hundred days is [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=532.8800000000001s)]
*  it what you expected good bad and otherwise wins and fails everything i'll go first i think it's a [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=538.0s)]
*  whirlwind i mean if you look at the uh that john boy the fighter pilot has this concept of the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=545.68s)]
*  udah loop which is observe orient decide and act and the concept is that if you're in dog fighting [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=550.4s)]
*  if you're able to maneuver through those udah loops at a faster pace than your than your [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=555.84s)]
*  competition they get disoriented and don't know what to do and i i think that that's got to be [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=561.36s)]
*  how democrats in washington and maybe mainstream republicans in washington certainly journalists [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=566.24s)]
*  are all feeling this like there's the the trump trump administration takes action and before [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=571.76s)]
*  anybody can respond to that they have already done like four more things and you're like wait i forgot [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=577.12s)]
*  to actually follow up on the other thing that they did that i didn't like uh and so it's yeah it's [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=581.36s)]
*  pretty disorienting if you're if you're trying to they they can't find a line to fall back to and [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=586.08s)]
*  go hey we're going to push back against this policy because they're already moving on to the [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=590.16s)]
*  next one the next one um so that's like my high level interpretation obviously i come at it from [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=593.36s)]
*  a trade angle i think everybody knew that trump was going to be he told us during the campaign [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=598.24s)]
*  that the the most beautiful word in the english language is tariff don't tell them it's an arabic [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=603.6800000000001s)]
*  word but the most beautiful word in the english language and so we knew that was coming i think [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=608.64s)]
*  that the the the suddenness of it all caught people by surprise i mean they told us april 1st [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=614.08s)]
*  april 2nd would be liberation day they didn't tell us that it would go live the next week you [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=621.04s)]
*  know and the fact you've already ordered these goods so that's one aspect that people are [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=626.0s)]
*  kind of disoriented about and then we're gonna unpack yeah we're gonna unpack that arian your [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=630.7199999999999s)]
*  thoughts on the first hundred days obviously you are a democrat and uh you were pretty vocal [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=635.8399999999999s)]
*  leading not in support of trump so what's your take on the first hundred days any any bright spots [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=643.5999999999999s)]
*  for you things you you know support actually sacks's world i'd say has has been a bright spot [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=648.08s)]
*  so especially i mean i think we have a very clear message on ai and uh and that that is that's been [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=654.4000000000001s)]
*  i think a huge net positive is um you know if you look at the the past you know few months [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=660.8000000000001s)]
*  out of all the the ai push from the administration it's unmistakably you know pro open source you [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=666.48s)]
*  know pro you know bring as much ai innovation you know to the u.s. obviously the tariffs you know add [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=671.5200000000001s)]
*  a little bit of a headwind to that i have some very strong asks you know around high skilled [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=677.44s)]
*  immigration because i think that you know ai talent is going to be super critical to to [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=681.7600000000001s)]
*  actually win the ai war so so i'd say that that directionally has has had some positive momentum [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=686.32s)]
*  you know from my perspective this is kind of playing out almost exactly how i thought it would [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=691.44s)]
*  six months ago and then three months ago i i think there was some signs that maybe maybe you know it [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=696.24s)]
*  wouldn't play out this way just based on some of the some of the you know kind of early groups that [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=702.96s)]
*  were coming to the white house the the the the sort of deep business you know kind of centricity of [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=708.1600000000001s)]
*  the white house you know i think it was day one or two that stargate was announced you know at the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=712.72s)]
*  white house we're going to go build massive infrastructure the case i'd like to make you [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=718.0s)]
*  know once we talk about tariffs is is i think there's an alternative universe where you just [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=721.9200000000001s)]
*  lean into acceleration as opposed to adding headwinds but but so that would be that would be the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=724.96s)]
*  case of what what maybe could have been you know very different is we just keep doubled down on [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=730.32s)]
*  doubling down on what's working while fixing the parts that aren't working but but that would be [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=734.1600000000001s)]
*  you know my my my judgment so far chamath i mean you've been talking about it here every week [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  you and i have been talking about it pretty consistently so i don't think there'll be many [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=746.24s)]
*  surprises here but take a second and maybe assess what you think if you had to pick a singular thing [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=749.84s)]
*  that's gone really well and a singular thing you think could be improved what what do you got [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=755.9200000000001s)]
*  let me give you my overall grade and then i'll tell you how i get to that i think the first [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=760.4000000000001s)]
*  hundred days have been a b plus and here's how i get to that score there have been two things [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=767.36s)]
*  where i think trump has frankly hit a home run the first is all of the direct investment [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=778.5600000000001s)]
*  and specifically the foreign direct investment into the united states [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=787.84s)]
*  i think it's approaching if not it has already exceeded a trillion dollars from corporations [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=793.36s)]
*  and organizations and individuals from around the world who have committed to bringing money [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=798.72s)]
*  into the united states and i think strategically that's a legacy that will live past him so i [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=805.12s)]
*  think that's been an a plus the second is we had a very unsafe border situation [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=811.9200000000001s)]
*  and he ran on shutting it down i'm not talking about the execution of the deportations i'm just [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=820.4000000000001s)]
*  saying getting the illegal crossings to zero and he's done that so that's been an a plus [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=827.0400000000001s)]
*  i think what's going to be more controversial are these next three things though in my [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=834.0s)]
*  interpretation i think the tariffs have been an a and i think that the market reaction the stock [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=839.52s)]
*  market is only down four percent and the interest rate markets are you know four and a quarter [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=847.12s)]
*  percent i think those have been an a now the reason i think tariffs have been an a is because it is [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=852.24s)]
*  uncovered in my opinion how beholden we are to a brittle supply chain and specifically to [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=860.48s)]
*  china who is a friend but who's also an enemy and i think that that's going to really severely [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=868.56s)]
*  complicate our flexibility and optionality in the future as they do what is in their best interests [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=873.68s)]
*  okay so where have they then not done so well i think the documents have been [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=881.68s)]
*  frankly a d we were supposed to get the abstain files we haven't yet we were supposed to get [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=888.4s)]
*  the martin luther king files we haven't we did get the redacted jfk files i don't think that [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=894.56s)]
*  there's been very good communication about why it's taking so long so i think it's a very small [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=900.0s)]
*  narrow thing but i think it had a lot of attention on the way in i think the [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=904.64s)]
*  communications of the tariffs and the back and forth had been a c i think the markets were not [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=910.16s)]
*  led in enough of a way where they could absorb the volatility [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=918.48s)]
*  but if you take it all in its totality i would give it a b plus i think it's been [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  very productive hundred days and when you look back i think in you know three years four years [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=931.44s)]
*  five years okay we've made some important progress sax obviously you're part of the [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=936.48s)]
*  administration so i'm not sure exactly how to ask you this but you sir you heard some nice [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=942.08s)]
*  compliments about ai from arron i happen to agree with those i actually agree with a good portion [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=946.4s)]
*  of the crypto stuff too i think actually getting those tightened up which are your two zones of [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=951.44s)]
*  excellence and your area that you're focused on i think you've done a great job there so [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=956.88s)]
*  just bestie to bestie great job there what's your thank you what's your take overall you know [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=961.68s)]
*  it's kind of hard i guess to ask somebody in the administration to criticize the image [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=966.56s)]
*  yeah but hearing everybody else's take what's your response maybe well i would i would highlight three [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=969.68s)]
*  main areas that i think are big accomplishments for the trump administration in the first hundred [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=974.72s)]
*  days so so number one has to be the border like jama said i think you have to give the administration [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=979.6s)]
*  an a plus on this they've completely stopped the border crisis i think we all knew that trump would [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=984.08s)]
*  take action on this because it's one of the main issues he campaigned on but i think if you had [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=989.5200000000001s)]
*  asked any of us you know four months ago would this problem be completely solved meaning border [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=993.2s)]
*  apprehensions completely stopped border completely sealed within the first hundred days i don't think [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=999.12s)]
*  we would have believed necessarily that it would get done so quickly but it has uh recall that for [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1004.1600000000001s)]
*  years during the biden years we were told for the first three years that the problem didn't even [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1011.28s)]
*  exist whenever the videos were published of caravans coming or throngs of people running [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1016.16s)]
*  across the border we were told that these were cherry pick videos on fox news it wasn't real [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1022.8s)]
*  finally in the last year the biden administration they said okay we're finally going to do something [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1028.48s)]
*  about it they took some limited actions they said that doing more than that would require [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1032.8s)]
*  new legislation well all of that was just gaslighting it turns out trump came in he [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1037.12s)]
*  restored remain of mexico and other policies completely stopped it he had this line at the [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1042.08s)]
*  state of the union which i think is exactly right which is we didn't need a new law we just needed [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1046.9599999999998s)]
*  a new president so i think that's area number one area number two i would say would be the vibe shift [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1050.3999999999999s)]
*  in the culture around wokeism and dei you know how quickly we forget about this but wokeism [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1057.04s)]
*  has completely collapsed i don't know that anyone is endorsing in a full-throated way moreover [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1064.08s)]
*  beyond just sort of the cultural aspect of it i think we've had significant policy changes on [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1071.04s)]
*  dei trump has basically ended dei at the government level he also signed an executive order ending [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1077.04s)]
*  the use of disparate impact for affirmative action this is the policy that said that even if you have [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1084.08s)]
*  a policy that's applied in a completely neutral and objective way if it results in a disparate [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1090.96s)]
*  impact where different groups are represented in a different way in the outcomes then somehow that [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1096.32s)]
*  must be racist and that led to essentially engineering the results of various populations [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1100.96s)]
*  to basically fit quotas and i think all of that now is fallen by the wayside and i think that [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1109.36s)]
*  meritocracy and colorblindness are back the only holdout really has been these universities where [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1115.52s)]
*  trump is now taking action against harvard and i think that ultimately we will win that battle you [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1121.84s)]
*  see that even in relatively liberal companies the di departments have been canceled and they're [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1127.36s)]
*  moving back towards more of a meritocracy so i would say that that's like big shift number two [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1133.12s)]
*  and i think if any of us had tried to predict that a hundred days ago we would have thought yes trump [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1138.16s)]
*  will do something about it but i don't think we would have predicted the total collapse [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1143.36s)]
*  of wokeism and dei so quickly and then i'd say the third area which is still in flight is the [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1147.04s)]
*  reprivatization of the economy that's a term that scott besson used i think that the trump [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1154.08s)]
*  administration needs to reprivatize the economy and i like that framing of it and there's a bunch [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1159.1999999999998s)]
*  of different pieces under that i'd say number one is doge again ending this hog wild government [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1164.8799999999999s)]
*  spending i do think that trump has come into office inheriting a very weak biden economy [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1172.72s)]
*  that was being propped up by massive amounts of government spending that was not only stimulating [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1178.64s)]
*  public sector but it was also goosing the employment numbers as well and we knew that that [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1184.16s)]
*  spending was unsustainable we have to do something about it so i think for the first time in decades [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1189.76s)]
*  we've actually started to make real cuts in government real cuts in the federal workforce [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1194.48s)]
*  and look we'd like to do more but that is a huge shift in the conversation there's other pieces of [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1200.32s)]
*  it as well i mean president trump has signed a significant number of executive orders on [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1205.76s)]
*  deregulation there's also been unleashing energy he ended biden's evie mandate and a lot of these [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1211.6s)]
*  like green new scam projects offshore wind and he's been encouraging oil and gas exploration so [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1217.4399999999998s)]
*  i think there's that and then i appreciate what erin said about tech innovation [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1224.8s)]
*  we did repeal biden's exec order on ai which was you know 100 pages of unnecessary regulation on ai [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1229.44s)]
*  we've ended the war on crypto and i think we're trying to stop the regulatory capture that [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1235.6000000000001s)]
*  benefits large incumbents so you have all these things and there's been other things that that [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1240.16s)]
*  have been done on the economy as well but i i do think that this sets us up for a trump boom in [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1244.48s)]
*  the future it's just that a lot of these changes take time to to play out okay great well done [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1250.24s)]
*  and well i think i think i think when you actually be very pro chamath uh chamath seems really pro [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1257.9199999999998s)]
*  other than he wants like the alien conspiracy files released which we'll get soon what is the [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1263.1999999999998s)]
*  what is the view from uh jay cali wendy where you're the the the left-leaning guy in the in the room [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1268.3999999999999s)]
*  you know i'm kind of independent but yeah social liberal you know i i look at what all americans [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1276.24s)]
*  believe and try to build some consensus here it's one of the things i've been trying to do on the [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1281.52s)]
*  pod is look for where we agree americans universally want the border secured they don't [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1285.52s)]
*  want illegal immigration and they don't want fentanyl so this is the biggest win i think for [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1292.4s)]
*  trump which i think everybody on the panel pointed out and sax you were dead right like when we were [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1296.24s)]
*  seeing those videos some of them were five years old some of them were recent biden really covered [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1300.96s)]
*  up what was going on in the border and it took years to figure out what was exactly going on [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1305.68s)]
*  there so that's the biggest win possible i give overall just to be brief a b for [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1309.76s)]
*  this first hundred days and i give you know biden like a c minus the second thing that everybody [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1316.4s)]
*  agrees on is they want to downsize the government they don't want waste and fraud so i think doge [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1321.68s)]
*  is the other huge win the things i think that could be improved really just three simple things [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1325.2s)]
*  the economic uncertainty is really terrible for running a business i'm seeing a lot of folks [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1331.76s)]
*  in my circle on my podcasts this week in startups and here telling me oh i don't know how to plan [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1336.48s)]
*  for the future and we're going to get into that with this tariff stuff and the trade war and so [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1341.8400000000001s)]
*  i think economic uncertainty we have to sort of slow down and maybe make it easier for people [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1346.48s)]
*  to understand what the administration is trying to do i think rule of law really matters to people [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1352.16s)]
*  people didn't like biden's pardons they didn't like covering up his mental acuity and i don't [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1357.2s)]
*  think people like the deportations without due process we talked about that on a previous episode [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1362.72s)]
*  overwhelmingly people want trump and the administration to obey what the supreme [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1367.6000000000001s)]
*  court says they really want rule of law the third term talk like eight out of ten [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1372.64s)]
*  americans don't like that kind of talk and then conflicts of interest obviously people hated the [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1377.84s)]
*  hunter biden stuff they hate the meme coin stuff and so that's where it could improve crisper [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1383.2s)]
*  communications more thoughtful execution maybe less trolling i don't like the white house twitter [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1388.48s)]
*  account trolling and then focus on what got trump here you know you all said the same thing what got [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1393.76s)]
*  trump in here was the economy and one thing that wasn't mentioned by everybody is the peace dividend [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1398.88s)]
*  and trump is making massive progress in ukraine apparently i don't know if it's on the docket today [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1405.1200000000001s)]
*  or not but stopping the wars and making the economy those are the two most important things [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1410.16s)]
*  that you can build on that i i totally missed that you're absolutely right that's another one [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1415.52s)]
*  where i would give trump an a plus nat and i had dinner with potus two weeks ago and you had dinner [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1419.6s)]
*  with trump this breaking news well okay whatever yes well i think it's i think it's remarkable how [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1426.8799999999999s)]
*  much putin apologists jake house become i mean you want to end the war in ukraine now well you're [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1431.68s)]
*  gonna you're just gonna give it you're just gonna give it to putin no no you're not gonna stop putin [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1436.08s)]
*  i'm totally in favor of what trump's doing in negotiating a deal to get our money back you [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1440.96s)]
*  want to talk to putin now i've always wanted to talk to putin i just don't trust him but you can [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1445.52s)]
*  trust him let me tell you what trump said so there we go there was a handful of us at dinner and then [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1450.4s)]
*  he got up to say a few words at the end and he reminded me why i was so inclined to vote for him [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1456.96s)]
*  which was he talked about his uncle and he talked about how his uncle taught him about the severity [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1468.08s)]
*  of nuclear war and how people don't understand how intense and how destructive it is and the [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1474.8s)]
*  power of these weapons and he left that speech at the end saying and this is why i'm so fundamentally [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1482.6399999999999s)]
*  against this thing and it reminded me to your point jason it is so easy to forget that there's [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1491.04s)]
*  only one existential risk save like aliens coming from the heavens right there's only one existential [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1497.6s)]
*  risk where all these issues become fringe issues you know you mentioned rule of law border security [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1504.56s)]
*  foreign direct investment tariffs it all goes out the window in a nuclear war and i was like i am so [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1509.84s)]
*  glad this guy's in charge because this one issue he never waivers and i think there's all kinds of [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1517.1999999999998s)]
*  complicated moments that could make this an issue and this was where my biggest issue with [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1525.52s)]
*  biden was was i did not know who was in control and i think that trump in the first hundred days to [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1531.92s)]
*  your point i think has completely reinforced that there are no conditions under which he'll go to [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1536.8s)]
*  war he is time and time again showed find the off-ramp and i think that that's really healthy [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1542.6399999999999s)]
*  for americans to see yeah and we build on that point with respect to to ukraine is we were on [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1547.12s)]
*  a glide path before the trump presidency that biden had put us on a certain path [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1552.64s)]
*  kamala harris gave every indication she would have continued it what was that path it was a [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1559.5200000000002s)]
*  path of continued escalation and doubling down in ukraine recall that it was biden himself at the [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1563.8400000000001s)]
*  beginning of the war who said that if we give ukraine abram's tanks and f-16s or atacams or [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1569.44s)]
*  high mars or if we allow them to hit targets inside of russia it would lead to world war three [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1577.92s)]
*  he actually used the word armageddon so at the beginning of that administration they were very [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1583.68s)]
*  concerned about how an escalatory path could lead us into direct conflict with russia and world war [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1589.04s)]
*  three and yet despite that at every fork in the road where they had a choice they ended up doubling [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1595.76s)]
*  down they gave the abram's tanks they gave the f-16s they gave the high mars they gave the atacams [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1601.1200000000001s)]
*  and finally when biden was a lame duck in his last couple months in office they did the most [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1605.84s)]
*  reckless and irresponsible thing which is allow american weapons to be used to strike targets [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1610.48s)]
*  on russian soil not just fighting in ukraine but on russian soil moreover we now know from a new [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1616.1599999999999s)]
*  york times article that just came out in the last few weeks that it was american generals and american [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1621.76s)]
*  intelligence who are planning this war so when you're talking about striking russian targets on [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1626.1599999999999s)]
*  russian soil it's not just the ukrainians using our weapons they're using our targeting they're [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1630.8799999999999s)]
*  using our guidance they're using our satellites i mean we are deeply integrated in the kill chain [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1635.44s)]
*  this is the united states being a co-belliger in the war hitting russian soil that is incredibly [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1640.64s)]
*  reckless and dangerous i have no doubt that if the democrats were still in office we would be in an [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1645.6000000000001s)]
*  escalatory spiral right now with the destination being world war three and i do think that trump [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1651.3600000000001s)]
*  has pulled us back from the brink there there's obviously still more work to do but i really [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1657.04s)]
*  appreciate the efforts that steve witkopf has undertaken where for the first time in [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1661.36s)]
*  three years we've at least had direct diplomacy with the russians we weren't even talking before [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1666.24s)]
*  we weren't even talking before talking is a great thing and and apparently we're going to keep [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1671.84s)]
*  supplying with them with weapons as long as they pay for them so it's going to be very interesting [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1676.24s)]
*  to see how this all hashes out over the next hundred days or so let's keep moving well i don't [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1680.24s)]
*  think we know that yet let's let's wait and see on that okay yeah i mean i think that's yeah uh [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1685.84s)]
*  what was reported but you're right we should wait and see okay downstream tariff impacts we [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1690.48s)]
*  got to talk about this and this is why we have you here ryan since you're in the thick of it [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1696.0s)]
*  you tweeted a thread last week about the lag time of shipments from china and when you were on i [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1700.48s)]
*  guess during covid you really educated us to how the supply chain how the supply chain works [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1707.44s)]
*  and according to the thread that you shared somewhere around early june we're going to [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1713.6s)]
*  expect warehouses trucking the entire supply chain maybe to start to seize up or layoffs i [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1719.2s)]
*  don't know how you would frame it ryan but are we past the point of no return with regard to the [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1727.04s)]
*  supply chain is there an off-ramp for this tariff conflict war negotiation with china in your mind [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1733.6000000000001s)]
*  what are you seeing on the streets and in the purchase orders and the invoices at flexport [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1740.8s)]
*  definitely not past the point of no return i think we're still right in the middle of the [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1747.92s)]
*  don't judge the cook while he's cooking is one you know like let's see what the let's see what [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1751.6000000000001s)]
*  it tastes like at the end is i think a starting point here and we're still they're still in the [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1754.96s)]
*  active negotiations so i don't think today's it's not static now the world does want a lot more [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1758.48s)]
*  certainty and that's a big cause of what's happened here and what has happened is a 60 percent decline [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1763.52s)]
*  in bookings of ocean freight from china to the u.s i mean so that's really really pretty dramatic [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1769.04s)]
*  probably exceeding what was expected i don't think you know when they issued when they rolled out the [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1774.8799999999999s)]
*  initial reciprocal tariff plans on on april 2nd it was meant to be a 54 percent tariff on china then [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1780.6399999999999s)]
*  you know there's multiple cycles of escalation we ended up at what's now 154 percent tariff so [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1786.8799999999999s)]
*  this is just a lot higher than anybody planned for and so therefore i don't think anyone's planning [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1793.36s)]
*  for a 60 percent decline in ocean freight ryan let me ask you a question about that [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1799.52s)]
*  are people actually paying that 154 percent there's been this discussion online and it's [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1805.28s)]
*  it's sort of unclear from the administration and from retailers stuff that's landing that people [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1810.0s)]
*  ordered before april 2nd are they actually paying the 154 percent on top of what's landing it's [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1817.44s)]
*  live now it was based on departure date so goods that departed china after midnight eastern time on [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1823.68s)]
*  april 9th are subject to the tariffs upon arrival and so now enough time has passed that pretty much [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1831.3600000000001s)]
*  all the ships that are arriving now left china after april 9th when that started so what happens [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1836.88s)]
*  people are paying it or are people saying i won't take delivery because it's too much you have you [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1841.52s)]
*  have to pay it ryan correct me if i'm wrong but you have to pay it at the dock in order to get the [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1845.92s)]
*  goods released more or less that's true you have a bond in place so you can pull the goods out [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1850.56s)]
*  before you pay but the money's owed at that time and then you get you get like a two-week time [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1856.88s)]
*  frame to actually make the payment but there are strategies here a lot of people are doing that [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1861.2s)]
*  you can use what's called a bonded warehouse and move cargo into this warehouse and then you only [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1865.52s)]
*  owe the duties when the cargo leaves um that's what i was asking like is there a hack here to [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1869.6s)]
*  it's not that that lets you defer things and it's very very common right now people are searching [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1874.64s)]
*  everywhere for bonded warehouse capacity because in a bonded warehouse not only you defer payment [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1879.04s)]
*  to when the cargo leaves the warehouse but you only owe the duty amount based on at that date [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1883.68s)]
*  so if the duties come back down which a lot of people are betting they will on the china [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1890.1599999999999s)]
*  specific duties you'll actually lower your tariff burden and then there's another hack for this [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1893.52s)]
*  which is effective use a mexican or canadian bonded warehouse so you move the goods into [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1898.56s)]
*  mexico and then you actually only technically import them into the u.s. at a future date when [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1903.36s)]
*  tariffs are lower so i understand a lot of a lot of companies are doing that right now too [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1908.08s)]
*  we're helping some people with that type of strategy but yeah is that sorry ryan do you [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1912.24s)]
*  think that the government will they view that okay that kind of hack and you know like you know like [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1917.1999999999998s)]
*  if you look at the gdp numbers one of the craziest things was the inventory pull forward that people [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1923.36s)]
*  did to your point like trying to get as much stuff into the united states before april 9th as an [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1928.24s)]
*  example yeah i mean it's not a hack it's a bonded warehouses have been around for decades and they're [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1934.16s)]
*  very commonly used i don't know that it'll be that material in the scheme of things [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1939.92s)]
*  that it would you know cause a change in the law around bonded warehouse so you don't think for [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1944.5600000000002s)]
*  example the department of commerce will have an issue with the strategy of sending inventory [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1949.2s)]
*  into mexico that essentially you're essentially like isn't it an art though it's a workaround [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1956.16s)]
*  like instead of paying the china tariff now you pay a mexico tariff which should be less is that [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1961.76s)]
*  the idea well you can move it into a bonded warehouse in mexico even and not pay mexican [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1965.28s)]
*  tariffs either and you just wait until it imports but i mean what's the department of commerce or [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1970.0s)]
*  the customs to do it sort of you just delayed importing the goods you imported them in the [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1974.8s)]
*  future and you know it doesn't i i wouldn't even call it a hack is just sort of like people people [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1979.2s)]
*  are going to get creative here you know what i mean like that's the job actually the government [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1984.56s)]
*  should set the rules and the rest of us got to figure out all right how are we going to compete [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1987.92s)]
*  and make money in this environment that they've created ryan in that tweet you redid which was a [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1991.44s)]
*  pretty dramatic tweet painting a very like i don't know you know like a pretty dire situation where [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=1996.3200000000002s)]
*  are we at in terms of how uh dire this will get or resolvable paint us the the the best case scenario [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2003.76s)]
*  and what you expect could happen in that case or if this gets extended are we going to see as you [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2012.3200000000002s)]
*  know people are hand-wringing empty store shelves christmas gets ruined and all these layoffs start [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2017.68s)]
*  happening in the supply chain take us through the two scenarios that people are debating yeah i mean [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2024.72s)]
*  the the bleak scenario which is i don't really think it's going to happen i think that the [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2028.88s)]
*  administration doesn't want this to be their legacy that they like created a policy that just [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2032.72s)]
*  like kind of tanked small business and supply chain so i don't i don't actually think this is [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2036.48s)]
*  going to happen but the bleak scenario is tariffs stay at this level for 145 on china the 10 goes [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2040.3200000000002s)]
*  way back up to what it was originally announced in reciprocal tariffs so there's no like safe [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2046.96s)]
*  haven for tariffs and trade just falls off a cliff and a lot of companies go bankrupt [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2050.56s)]
*  in our in our especially small companies are the ones that are importing from china [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2054.8s)]
*  reality is like tariffs have been high on china for a long time labor costs in china are not are [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2058.56s)]
*  you're not there for cheap labor you're there for quality manufacturing at this point like [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2063.44s)]
*  there's much cheaper labor in southeast asia or other parts of the world than there is in china [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2067.04s)]
*  so you're in china because of the manufacturing capabilities the ecosystem not just for cheap [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2071.44s)]
*  labor and if you could have moved you would have already with the 25 percent tariffs from the [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2075.6s)]
*  trump's first terms were pretty high or high enough incentive and so that's the bleak scenarios [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2080.64s)]
*  that small business starts getting wiped out the ones that are buying from china and it's a lot [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2086.3199999999997s)]
*  of brands like it's not just amazon sellers selling stuff that you don't need it's like [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2090.7999999999997s)]
*  all the brands that you know are like you know fashion brands apparel brands i had cuts clothing [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2096.7999999999997s)]
*  on this week in startups last week and he said there's gonna be like if this doesn't get revolved [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2102.96s)]
*  resolved in like let's say two to four weeks in his group chats people are going to start layoffs [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2107.76s)]
*  and they they can't physically restart the supply chain in vietnam or wherever to make t-shirts so [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2112.88s)]
*  aram what's your thought on this as well just bringing you in sure well first of all i mean [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2119.92s)]
*  ryan has supplied me with a high degree of doom scrolling and it's like a horror show reading his [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2125.36s)]
*  sweets first of all like i would feel better if the messages out of the administration were either [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2131.28s)]
*  more kind of consistent or that there was a logical connection between do we either want to raise [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2136.88s)]
*  the kind of you know tariff revenue stream or do we want free trade like like those things are [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2144.4s)]
*  working against each other because like depending on who you talk to they say this is a mechanism [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2150.88s)]
*  to bring down income tax which obviously then by definition means that they expect the tariffs [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2155.84s)]
*  to sort of persist which is totally different from let's go negotiate deals that just allow for [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2160.32s)]
*  the you know free trade to actually increase and so are we worried about the reciprocity or are we [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2165.52s)]
*  worried about kind of revenue streams so that's a whole whole issue you also have this issue which [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2170.2400000000002s)]
*  is the messaging from the government and this is the meta point i'll make in a second is about is [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2174.88s)]
*  about how we could have actually accelerated into the transformation of the economy but you know you [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2179.04s)]
*  have folks like letnik etc you know going on on tv talking about the the end state of our economy [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2183.6000000000004s)]
*  which are are actually probably you know find messages but but we haven't seen what that vision [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2188.4s)]
*  looks like you know so everybody is kind of confused like does this mean that we literally [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2194.4s)]
*  go into manufacturing plants and we're like the ones literally doing the screws on an iphone or [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2197.84s)]
*  is it a bunch of jobs which are next generation you know jobs which is like we're managing robots [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2202.8s)]
*  and and like shipping logistics grows as a result of this and all of the surrounding kind of supply [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2207.52s)]
*  chains you know start to grow so like like you know like there's a there's underlying i mean [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2212.32s)]
*  you know most people on this call have managed teams like you do change management you lead [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2218.4s)]
*  people to the end state that that you want them to sort of see the potential in and and i think [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2222.4s)]
*  some something that kind of gets missed is and the part that kind of confused me is like i don't know [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2228.0s)]
*  if if you know exactly to ryan's point like people are in china because of the ecosystem of manufacturing [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2231.6800000000003s)]
*  yet the messages you get out of the administration are like oh you know we're gonna have fewer toys [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2237.44s)]
*  at christmas time it's like no that's not the big picture like the big picture is like like you know [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2241.7599999999998s)]
*  this is supplying the parts that go into a building a manufacturing plant and building a car that that [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2246.88s)]
*  allows us to actually you know be even remotely competitive in car manufacturing so where should [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2252.96s)]
*  in your mind this all lead because you have some thoughts on american exceptionalism and maybe [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2257.68s)]
*  skating to where the puck is going so if you were to become an advisor yeah on this as a technology [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2263.2s)]
*  expert and somebody who spent their whole career in it what would you advise them to do [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2270.08s)]
*  i'd get rid of navarro immediately and and you would basically say you know mea culpa like oops [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2273.84s)]
*  and like obviously you need to like land that with some really cool trade deals that make everybody [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2280.08s)]
*  kind of feel happy and you basically say you know what like let's go back to the first two days of [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2283.84s)]
*  trump which is let's announce massive deals we're bringing manufacturing here with stargate we're [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2288.8s)]
*  doing tsmc we're building nvidia chips we're gonna do a deal which is you get like five percent tax [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2294.96s)]
*  rate if you build in america and so you just stimulate a manufacturing boom in the country [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2301.68s)]
*  you know we incentivize you know automation across the manufacturing we use that as a competitive [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2307.68s)]
*  weapon to then go and compete with with the sort of lower cost labor that that happens internationally [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2312.48s)]
*  you know we we find every incentive and tool we can we deregulate you allow people to build these [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2318.7200000000003s)]
*  plants and so you don't have to go through the you know three-year epa process like like you just [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2323.84s)]
*  accelerate from from this position and you see you see it all as upside and so then business leaders [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2328.88s)]
*  if you go talk to the fortune 500 company that actually has to build you know anything right now [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2336.0s)]
*  you give them a path to say listen we're going to help you transition away from your current [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2340.4s)]
*  supply chain and we're going to make it even more competitive and more compelling in america [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2344.56s)]
*  to do that you know there's a reason that elon builds in america like like he is he's actually [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2348.6400000000003s)]
*  made it be more effective to to be able to to you know bring automation to manufacturing to be [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2353.36s)]
*  able to to build locally but he wasn't forced to do that and so so i would just i would argue like [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2358.6400000000003s)]
*  you you use as many carrots as possible in some surgical areas and chamath i've heard your points [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2364.0s)]
*  about the like you know chips pharma you know ai like in those surgical areas we get tough where [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2369.1200000000003s)]
*  where necessary and and if we have to do you know a couple sort of very surgical tariffs you know to [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2375.04s)]
*  kind of make make people move the the direction that we want that's totally fine but but i mean [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2380.96s)]
*  i like it's like even arguing the premise is hard because because we act like like it's like countries [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2385.44s)]
*  that are screwing us but actually businesses are are independently making decisions about where they [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2390.88s)]
*  want their supply chain to exist they have this in a free market they've made that decision they [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2396.0s)]
*  don't need the government to tell them where where are they supposed to or where are they allowed to [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2401.2s)]
*  to have their supply chain operate that that ends up with just lots of economic distortions [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2405.76s)]
*  that everybody on the right would have called you know the left socialists for trying to kind [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2410.08s)]
*  of implement central planning around supply chains so that's my piece well no what do you think chamath [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2415.04s)]
*  here of this sort of reframing slash off-ramp and sort of maybe the positive spin on it hey if you [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2419.44s)]
*  want to make t-shirts you know you want to make commodity items have at it free trade you know [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2424.88s)]
*  reciprocal tariffs great checkbox there but here is a series of incentives and a path forward to do [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2430.4s)]
*  the advanced stuff to do robotics etc let me answer this in a different way okay a lot of those [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2437.92s)]
*  things he's actually doing i think this is where we are is we're beyond tds there's something that [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2444.96s)]
*  comes after it and i think that the mainstream media has just lost their mind to a degree that [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2454.0s)]
*  they hadn't even lost their mind in trump one i'll give you a couple of examples [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2462.0s)]
*  well one example by the way just a shout out to our friend completely brazen ridiculous [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2467.52s)]
*  sh-tty reporting by the wall street journal last night when they were told that this you know this [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2473.2s)]
*  whole tesla thing was a total farce they continued to publish it okay fine they're they are referring [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2478.32s)]
*  to elon the board yeah starting a search to replace elon and then the board said well wait [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2484.48s)]
*  we told you we weren't doing that and they didn't even mention they communicated that directly to [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2489.84s)]
*  the wall street journal the wall street journal said i don't care i have an axe to grind correct [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2494.32s)]
*  i think that trump has a strength which is he shapes these potholes for the mainstream media [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2501.04s)]
*  to fall into the downside of that though is that the mainstream media then doesn't do the other [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2506.4s)]
*  part of the job which is to tell the things that are important so for example we spent a lot of [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2511.76s)]
*  time breathlessly talking about the ms13 knuckles of the guy right or then we spent a bunch of time [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2517.12s)]
*  talking about how ms mbc blurred out the names of the placards on the lawn okay but here's the other [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2524.96s)]
*  part where then they get so tilted here's what they don't report they didn't report that for example [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2532.96s)]
*  when trump took a shot at harvard he also reinforced and strengthened historically black colleges and [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2539.44s)]

*  a business case if this actually gets effectuated the point is that thing would create an absolute [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2577.2799999999997s)]
*  economic bonanza if it were to get passed other than people hearing it on this pod or randomly [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2586.96s)]
*  maybe finding it on a direct clip that besant puts out on x there has been zero coverage by the [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2594.0s)]
*  mainstream media yeah but but like like the the uh first of all that yeah okay msm and whatever [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2599.92s)]

*  a change management process that that causes people to build on momentum and not causes boards [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2612.7200000000003s)]

*  trump you know didn't get a call back from from she like like that that is like this is really [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2623.2799999999997s)]

*  i think that she would give you a calculated answer that neither is pro or con i think i think that [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2662.08s)]
*  answer changes by the day i think that if you talked to her last week she would say this has [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2667.2s)]
*  been a major headwinds and then yesterday to chumas point they did this thing with you can [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2670.7200000000003s)]
*  depreciate or fully expense in your one capital improvements or building out factories but also [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2674.88s)]
*  earlier this week they made it so that auto auto parts are not subject to the tariffs they created [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2680.0s)]
*  a huge exemption yeah it wasn't everything like it's great should have been by the way that [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2685.92s)]
*  should all speaks to if this was a big better plan it should have been there in the beginning [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2690.8s)]
*  because these auto auto companies are saying hey this is going to bankrupt us i think yeah where [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2694.48s)]
*  where i would take your side going back to communication and making a crisper and yeah [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2698.64s)]
*  you're right erin where you are right is my expectation is it's my job to stay informed [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2703.6s)]
*  okay as a ceo of my company i try to stay informed and you're right it is hard because sometimes i [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2708.96s)]
*  find myself hunting and pecking to find the things that matter but i do put a bunch of that [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2715.36s)]
*  responsibility into the lap of the people that are supposed to actually report the facts they can [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2720.7200000000003s)]
*  choose they didn't have to run that article about elon which turned out to be total bullsh** and [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2726.32s)]
*  horse on the front page of the wall street journal they could have talked about what ryan just [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2731.92s)]
*  mentioned as the first article and said here completely changes your roick and roe calculations [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2735.92s)]
*  for 90 of the smp 500 that was not the article they chose to write and to publish i but i also [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2743.12s)]
*  think it comes back to my original point around the udot loops that they're the trump is the [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2749.44s)]
*  administration is running these very tight hey let's take an action let's see what happens let's [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2753.6s)]
*  see the reaction and then take another action washington's used to doing all these committees [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2758.48s)]
*  that plan everything for five years or something or whatever 18 months and then roll it out slowly [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2762.16s)]
*  and they're going hey let's roll it out oh crap we're about to cause this huge problem in the [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2767.12s)]
*  auto manufacturers and they're all telling us they're going to go bankrupt okay three days later [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2771.04s)]
*  they push an update to that it's kind of it feels chaotic but just yeah to summarize ryan and aaron [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2775.04s)]
*  your position so we can keep going through the docket hey a little less shock and awe maybe a [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2780.3199999999997s)]
*  little more predictability a little crisper communication and shemoth i think your position [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2785.2s)]
*  is hey maybe the mainstream media can play a better role here and focusing us on what matters [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2789.12s)]
*  that wouldn't be my takeaway so yeah okay my what's your takeaway i mean like like zero [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2794.4s)]
*  shocking off like okay like not a little less like like i like my strategy would be a hundred [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2800.0s)]
*  percent different actually scott beston has an incredible podcast from like september of last [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2804.96s)]
*  year and he basically said you know biden by dynamics got it all wrong and i was like listening [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2810.0s)]
*  to it i was like oh okay actually this is kind of cool like he basically says deregulate the u.s. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2814.56s)]
*  make it easier to build manufacturing in the u.s. increase the gdp and then you'll be able to take [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2820.56s)]
*  in less tax revenue spend less in the government and it was like oh this is actually like a glide [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2825.6s)]
*  path we could take we could take the fact that we did a soft landing relative to the rest of the [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2830.24s)]
*  globe we're winning an ai we're winning in it and in you know a you know number of categories we [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2835.12s)]
*  obviously need more energy we need we need to bring in manufacturing into the u.s. and so you [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2840.56s)]
*  have this great momentum which is where we are the tech leader you know in the world let's like just [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2845.68s)]
*  pour fuel on that and so to pour fuel on that you you do you just do a series of carrots and [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2849.84s)]
*  and the winds that build a flywheel of positive energy like the reason why i take i take a little [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2855.6s)]
*  bit of exception to to chumas msm point is that i think to some extent fortune 500 ceos are not [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2861.36s)]
*  the ones like oh my gosh like and like rachel maddow said this like i'm gonna go and and you [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2866.48s)]
*  know worry about this topic now like they like like the information coming at them is is i'm [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2871.6s)]
*  not talking about the information that's presented i'm talking about the information that's excluded [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2875.76s)]
*  how do you get the information that's not published in shared broads no no but come on like [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2880.56s)]
*  goldman sachs and j.p morgan are not writing reports on the fact that we might enter a recession [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2884.88s)]
*  because of of msnb's msnbc's reporting on this topic like like but again but again that's not [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2889.36s)]
*  what i'm talking about i'm saying like glad handing some high level prognostication which [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2895.36s)]
*  nobody ever gets right is in my opinion worthless what i'm talking about is the details so when you [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2900.8s)]
*  talk about something as narrow and specific as excluding ppe or allowing you to double or triple [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2907.04s)]
*  depreciate something in a given calendar year that is narrow it's precise it's specific it's actionable [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2913.76s)]
*  and what i'm saying is if i surveyed the 500 ceo of the smp 500 dollars to donuts the overwhelming [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2920.72s)]
*  majority would not have known and had they brushed up against that somehow in their normal media [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2927.4399999999996s)]
*  consumption to then ask their teams the odds of that would have been zero as well and all i'm [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2932.64s)]
*  saying is who do we who do we blame for this chamoff is it the administration's job or mishra [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2938.3199999999997s)]
*  media but i bet you everybody knows about the blurring out of the stupid you know pictures on [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2942.8799999999997s)]
*  the lawn and the ms13 knuckle tattoos yeah okay so let's wrap up on this just really lightning [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2946.88s)]
*  round here amazon flip-flopped on a new tariff notification on their websites trump said he had [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2953.12s)]
*  a great discussion with bezos he solved the problem very quickly he did the right thing good guy [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2959.36s)]
*  etc if you haven't seen this it's something that timu is doing here's what timu does [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2964.7200000000003s)]
*  uh currently today nick you have that image if you could pull it up of just when there is a tariff [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2971.52s)]
*  they explain the tariff coming into the country they put it as like a line item i thought this [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2977.4399999999996s)]
*  was actually kind of cool i don't know why people take offense with ryan this is pretty standard [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2983.3599999999997s)]
*  stuff so amazon's competitor timu is putting in the import charges they don't say tariffs they [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2987.04s)]
*  don't say taxes import charges this is like a standard thing what has happened in other [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2992.3999999999996s)]
*  countries too what is this what is timu is like a dollar store it's basically like a dollar is [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=2995.9199999999996s)]
*  this the last place you would ever buy anything you never bought jeans yeah you can buy 12 dollar [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3000.48s)]
*  jeans basically your left sock from lorapiana costs less than timu's entire inventory of jeans [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3005.68s)]
*  the point being um i thought this was actually a plus for i think that amazon totally misplayed [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3013.68s)]
*  this they they did they rolled it out then they got criticized i think they were called a treasonous [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3021.04s)]
*  company from the white house press uh you know by the press secretary uh they totally misplayed [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3024.96s)]
*  this because they should have gone and leaned into it and said yeah we're showing you all these [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3029.28s)]
*  tariffs when you buy from china if you buy from america you don't have to pay any tariff no guys [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3034.0s)]
*  other products come on come on that would have lasted three and a half seconds this is exactly [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3038.8s)]
*  consistent with the other issue which is they're playing whack-a-mole okay we're going to do [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3043.0400000000004s)]
*  something with the automakers we're going to we're going to try and solve some problem with amazon [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3046.88s)]
*  like like this is a sign that that it's like it's not a good strategy if you have to do this much [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3051.28s)]
*  whack-a-mole like like they're not like they can't cover up what amazon is going to end [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3056.88s)]
*  up dealing with because there's going to be 500 other retailers that don't get the call with [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3061.52s)]
*  trump so so this is like that like to me that's evidence of of clearly this they didn't think [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3065.76s)]
*  through the entire downstream set of of of conditions that are going to change as a result of this [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3071.6s)]
*  sure yeah i i thought this was a big win uh chamoff because they could then have amazon here's um a [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3076.32s)]
*  mock-up somebody made i'll pull it up here it was interesting they could to arron's point just show [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3084.88s)]
*  hey here's a bunch of american companies buy american when you do a search that's ryan's point [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3090.32s)]
*  i'm sorry ryan's point hey here's what it might look like pull out um the oral b toothbrush one [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3094.8s)]
*  up uh nick if you got it right there so somebody mocked this up i think this could be the hugest [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3100.4s)]
*  win you could have the retailers do buy american buy it once buy a high quality product from [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3104.88s)]
*  america if you look here we don't have the products it wouldn't work we don't have the products [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3111.52s)]
*  well i mean we do have for some products you know american-made products uh you know i buy my boots [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3118.0s)]
*  from daner and those are all american so yeah so we should just go back to communism and we're all [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3122.96s)]
*  going to make our shoes like it's like that's like we're in a global market like we buy from everywhere [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3127.84s)]
*  chamoff any thoughts on this i mean obviously there's the whack-a-mole angle there's buy american [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3134.24s)]
*  and be proud of it here's the communication here's the narrow question i i got a bunch of emails [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3140.32s)]
*  from people and a bunch of them were amazon sellers and i don't know nick if you can find it but i [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3145.6000000000004s)]
*  posted their comments and i reshared them just to kind of highlight the issues that they were going [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3152.96s)]
*  through and at the core of it was a feeling by them that amazon had abandoned them as american [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3158.7200000000003s)]
*  purveyors and sellers of goods and that amazon on the margins had a tendency to help [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3168.0s)]

*  and margin this is my view completely and that this is the biggest opportunity that i think the [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3184.48s)]
*  trump administration administration's flying at 40 000 feet doing macro level negotiations and look [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3188.88s)]
*  and failing to see some of these micro optimizations that are really really real so [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3193.92s)]
*  you in the united states you can import goods as a foreign company you don't not you do not have [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3197.76s)]

*  company just imports this stuff and they sell on amazon and when they get caught cheating they can [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3212.56s)]
*  they can lie about the valuation and pay a lower tariff they can change the classification and pay [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3217.84s)]
*  a lower tariff they can import stuff that you know is harmful to children has lead paint whatever [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3221.76s)]
*  else there's no enforcement at all you can't go after these people so you're saying amazon third [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3226.1600000000003s)]

*  the game that's on the field but they're this is legal in the united states is these companies [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3234.6400000000003s)]

*  registered they're not registered in the united states at all just chinese companies okay look [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3242.88s)]
*  which sounds profoundly unfair in terms of a level playing field can we just take a step back and [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3246.1600000000003s)]
*  also acknowledge that we are talking about a level of detailed issues that we would never have [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3250.64s)]
*  talked about six months ago that there was no interest in even bringing this up like if if [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3256.64s)]
*  ryan wanted to bring up the sort of hollowing out of american salesmanship let's say if you will [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3263.2799999999997s)]
*  because of like this arbitrage that amazon does for gmv that would have been a snooze fest except [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3271.92s)]
*  today it can actually get a lot of awareness and erin mentioned this and i've mentioned this before [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3278.32s)]
*  but like i think that there are four things that really matter batteries ai pharma api and rare [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3283.36s)]
*  earths that now is on the agenda i think the the positive way to look at this is the american [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3289.6000000000004s)]
*  economy is too complicated if you had waited erin for a study for all of the implications we would [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3294.4s)]
*  have been waiting forever and nothing would have happened and i think that we've made macro level [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3301.1200000000003s)]
*  moves you're right and now we are finding what the implications are in course correcting in real [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3306.08s)]
*  time and i hope what happens though is when we find these big thorny issues i think the amazon [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3311.04s)]
*  thing is a is a pretty interesting issue actually about like american competitiveness now the question [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3316.7999999999997s)]
*  is do we follow through and get to the root cause of it and and fix it and those feedback loops are [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3321.92s)]
*  there i mean the trump administration is going to act on this and if then there's an act that's [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3327.2799999999997s)]
*  coming out of congress as well to shut down the foreign import of records so those feedback loops [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3330.72s)]
*  are there in ways that i don't i don't know if they were there in the past go ahead erin we can [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3334.56s)]
*  totally chaos monkey the the economy and just see what breaks i think that the you know you you sort [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3337.92s)]
*  of phrase the we could you know do the research paper and we could do at you know aspen institute [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3345.6s)]
*  as a bad thing but also it can be a bad thing if you're the small business owner right now [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3350.24s)]
*  who has 30 employees and you just literally don't know what you're going to do next month and so [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3355.2799999999997s)]
*  so that's that's sort of then the argument to not you know it's a good counterbalance that's like [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3359.2s)]
*  why you do have some bureaucracy and you don't chaos monkey the economy and why ran paul is [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3363.2s)]
*  literally saying maybe we shouldn't actually let you know have unilateral you know control over [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3368.16s)]
*  tariffs so you know interesting that that like dynamic there all right sax you want to uh wrap [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3372.3999999999996s)]
*  us up here or you want to pass oh am i still in the pod yeah well you turned your camera off so [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3379.2799999999997s)]
*  look i spent 80 minutes debating this topic with larry summer streaks ago [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3386.7999999999997s)]
*  so the point i made then is that we had in this city for 25 years a globalist consensus on trade [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3391.76s)]
*  that distorted a lot of outcomes i don't need to rehash that debate but i'll just recall that larry [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3401.6000000000004s)]
*  summer's main argument for why this would not work out is that the market was down do you remember [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3407.92s)]
*  that that was his evidence yeah this wasn't going to work okay and it was all about the market now [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3413.6800000000003s)]
*  pricing in lower expectations well guess what the market is actually up since liberation day on [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3419.28s)]
*  april 2nd so what happened three weeks ago was basically a panic in the market over this policy [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3424.96s)]
*  and the media has been trying to fuel that panic now what i said as well as we do have to stick the [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3432.96s)]
*  landing on this i mean president trump shifted the conversation away from this globalist consensus [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3439.0400000000004s)]
*  and he's now redefined the debate but it is now up to scott bessen the treasury secretary howard [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3445.12s)]
*  lepnick the commerce secretary javison greer the u.s trade rep and so on the trump trade team [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3451.04s)]
*  to now negotiate these deals stick the landing and i agree with you to the extent that the sooner [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3456.72s)]
*  that is done the better because it is good to provide business certainty but the idea that so [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3461.92s)]
*  far this hasn't worked i think again the main argument against that was the market reaction [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3468.3199999999997s)]
*  that now the market's now positive so i think my point is just we need to give this time to work [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3472.64s)]
*  i think it's too soon to be judging this policy as if it hasn't worked yet it needs to be executed [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3479.52s)]
*  properly and quite frankly ryan i mean i remember the last time you were on this pod you were coming [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3484.48s)]
*  on about wasn't there like some union deal that was supposed to shut down all the ports and all [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3490.24s)]
*  the shelves would be empty that never happened either it did happen it did they shut down for [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3494.7999999999997s)]
*  three days okay i don't remember the shells being empty which is now the new panic the media is [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3498.96s)]
*  trying to create so look there's a lot of pant sweating that's occurring here that's being killed [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3504.7200000000003s)]
*  by the media well i do want i do want i just want to bookmark one one thing the only thing i actually [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3509.2s)]
*  um i was more frustrated listening to the larry summers and and you a conversation because i was [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3514.32s)]
*  like why larry make this point like come on like what don't go down the wto rat hole like that's [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3518.4s)]
*  that's not relevant so here's the only thing the course is relevant it's how we got here no no it's [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3522.56s)]
*  like as in like that's 25 years ago like let's worry about literally today and like what what [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3528.0s)]
*  do we do going forward today is and and the only thing i just want to say because i because i do [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3532.6400000000003s)]
*  think that that you know i appreciate your point about hey there's like you know everybody's [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3538.0s)]
*  freaking out whatever but to be totally fair that some of that freak out whether we can decide how [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3542.2400000000002s)]
*  emotional it needs to be is the reason that then trump walks back the things that then caused the [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3547.84s)]
*  market to correct so so we can't just say the market's back and and like see we didn't need to [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3552.0s)]
*  freak out because it was literally i said we have to make the deals we have to stick the landing but [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3557.12s)]
*  look china over the last 25 years has been able to strategically annihilate our rare earth processing [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3561.04s)]
*  capability and our ability to cast rare earth magnets we just sat back and watched as the [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3568.16s)]
*  market basically went to the lowest bidder which was being subsidized by the chinese government [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3574.48s)]
*  which the wto allowed them to do which you totally have a critical dependency yep and our supply [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3577.92s)]
*  chain on china for basically every electric motor in every product including cars that was crazy we [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3583.36s)]
*  should not have allowed that to happen yeah how are you going to change that so we needed to [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3589.6800000000003s)]
*  shift the political conversation to recognize the ways in which it's free trade led to unfair trade [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3594.32s)]
*  and created unacceptable dependencies on the american economy wait wait just i just want to [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3600.88s)]

*  able to have strategic optionality to make the decision that's morally and ethically right for [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3653.68s)]
*  the united states and i think that we have learned through this lens that these are huge issues the [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3658.64s)]
*  thing that the chinese did that was so brilliant which we still don't have an answer for is they [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3664.96s)]
*  have these national champions and being a national champion allows you and we'll talk about this in [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3669.84s)]

*  blur the law it allows you to blur capital and i'm not saying we have to do that but what i am saying [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3679.6800000000003s)]
*  is we need to have our own answer to it and that was never on the table until april 9th [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3686.2400000000002s)]

*  a mad rush is the strategy no no no because because that's a you if you have a you know [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3699.12s)]
*  ryan what is the number i don't know trillion of imports or whatever like you don't need everybody [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3703.7599999999998s)]

*  problem immediately if we're sitting here in nine months and you're saying this and there are no [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3712.56s)]
*  deals i would say that you're right what howard letnick said last week and again we may have all [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3716.3199999999997s)]

*  end up in a good spot because we'll iterate through this my my only point is there's an alternative [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3763.44s)]
*  path that that could have occurred it could have been done that's all in a more thoughtful well [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3767.04s)]
*  communicated pattern instead of hey let's do barrel rolls with the airplane i don't disagree [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3771.28s)]

*  i think we'll agree to disagree on this we gotta move on hold on this one last point we're gonna [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3786.3199999999997s)]
*  move on excuse me excuse me you didn't call me for 40 minutes i just want to make one final point [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3791.52s)]
*  oh here he goes arron where were you with this perfect plan yeah where were you with this perfect [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3795.8399999999997s)]
*  plan before liberation day i was telling about it you're telling calm okay great he was no [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3801.52s)]
*  nobody nobody all the happy my ties and they were talking about this specific issue all the people [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3808.0s)]
*  who suddenly know what the perfect plan is and how to perfectly execute it no barrel rolls had [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3814.0s)]
*  nothing to say about this topic for 25 years and all of a sudden they've come forward with their [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3818.96s)]
*  perfect plans i would say that's victory for trump it's like look at this the best thing of all of [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3824.16s)]
*  this is you've got the liberals embracing milton friedman and their backgrounds on their yes [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3829.3599999999997s)]
*  all right listen we're going to agree to disagree we're going to agree to disagree on this one the [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3834.08s)]
*  liberals love the stock market listen sax comil is coming on next week we're going to make some [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3837.92s)]
*  cocktails it's going to be wonderful you will we'll ask her some direct questions about it but i [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3842.88s)]
*  want to talk about ai agents 2025 shaping up to be the year of ai agents tons to talk about here [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3848.2400000000002s)]
*  open ai is planning to charge between two and 20k a month for different levels of ai agencies would be [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3855.1200000000003s)]
*  basically cron jobs they would run in the background and do things for your company that [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3861.04s)]
*  humans are doing right now you may have heard of this agentic tool again agentic is just a fancy [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3864.96s)]
*  word for agent which is a fancy role for word for like a cron job that just runs no uh perpetually [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3870.48s)]
*  yep and uh manis is uh the company in china that started this weirdly benchmark invested in it that's [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3876.2400000000002s)]
*  created a whole fluffle on the side and manas's website has a really good visualization of what [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3883.76s)]
*  these agents would look like so first of all i think you're giving a little too much credit [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3888.32s)]
*  to manis they didn't come up with the agents but i do think that they have a very good demo [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3891.6800000000003s)]
*  and it's hard to know exactly how real it is because everyone's used it but it's from china [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3896.8s)]
*  it's from china i'll get to that in a second if you go to their website you can see a bunch of [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3901.44s)]
*  their their demos and i do think that what they deserve credit for is advancing the ball on the [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3905.84s)]
*  ui paradigm and it's not that other people weren't doing this i mean i think notably [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3912.96s)]
*  anthropic was doing this with its operator product but the basic idea is that you've got [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3917.68s)]
*  this two pane view and in one window you've got the standard chatbot interface and then in the [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3922.08s)]
*  other view you can see what the agent is doing and that agent has the ability to toggle between [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3927.68s)]
*  currently four apps their search browser code terminal and document editor and so when you [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3934.16s)]
*  give manas a task the first thing it does is create a to-do list in the document editor you [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3940.64s)]
*  can kind of see it there and then it works sequentially to achieve each of those tasks [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3945.44s)]
*  and then puts an x on them there and you can kind of see it working and i think what's cool [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3949.36s)]
*  about the demo is just the way that it seamlessly toggles between those four apps and you can see [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3954.0s)]
*  what the ai agent is doing you know and it's browsing the internet it's searching for things [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3959.44s)]
*  it's writing documents it's crossing things off its to-do list now i think it's pretty easy to [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3963.52s)]
*  imagine where this goes which is you'll be able to connect an agent to all of your sas apps so it [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3968.88s)]
*  won't just be four applications it'll now be connected to dozens of applications including [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3975.04s)]
*  ones that already have your data and it's going to know what actions it's possible to take in [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3980.0s)]
*  those apps so when it creates its to-do list there's a much wider range of things that it [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3984.32s)]
*  can accomplish and in fact there's a new standard called mcp which is taking off like wildfire which [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3989.2s)]
*  is built specifically to enable agents to connect with applications and understand the data and [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3994.88s)]
*  understand the actions that are possible in those sas applications so look manas is just [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=3999.92s)]
*  typically iceberg here i think this will become a very standard ui paradigm that's the reason why i [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4004.96s)]
*  mention it not because i am pre-declaring them to be the winner in the space but just because [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4008.96s)]
*  i think there's a lot of talk about agents and i think it's hard to [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4013.6800000000003s)]
*  conceptualize what that means without just seeing it visually great great summary there sacks and [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4017.76s)]
*  arron i want to get your thoughts on it because obviously you're running box and you have your [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4023.92s)]
*  finger on the pulse of this we actually started building one of these in our venture firm we have [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4028.08s)]
*  20 000 applications a year and we have updates coming in from investments we are now taking [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4033.44s)]
*  those sacks arron and we are having an agent sort them and then look for competitors and compare [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4038.64s)]
*  them to the last update and we're looking into our notion our coda and saying what else have what [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4045.2s)]
*  other communications have we had what questions should we ask about this startup and about their [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4051.04s)]
*  strategy and then we're presenting that in slack to our team so this is coming fast and furious [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4055.04s)]
*  and we spend i don't know probably 15 minutes on each of those incoming applications to start [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4060.4s)]
*  doing the math on that talking about 5 000 hours of work arron what are you seeing on the street [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4065.04s)]
*  what are you doing at box in terms of agents landing right now in q2 of 2025 uh yeah i mean i [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4069.92s)]
*  think i think sacks represented it well which is which is you know you have to now think about ai [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4078.2400000000002s)]
*  as effectively being able to do anything on a computer or another piece of software as a human [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4083.6s)]
*  can do and the little distraction that i think happened two years ago after the chat tbt moment [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4088.72s)]
*  was we sort of thought about that as oh we're just gonna now you know do like typing information [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4094.72s)]
*  retrieval and that's a new paradigm for user interfaces let's say so you just like talk to [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4099.04s)]
*  your software and you like search zillow via chat that was sort of a little bit of a distraction [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4103.92s)]
*  that's super helpful like when you want basic information look up or whatnot the big breakthrough [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4108.5599999999995s)]
*  starting to think through these things as as full you know effectively uh you know agentic systems [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4113.04s)]
*  that that operate on any amount of data any amount of tools for as long as you want to complete any [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4119.28s)]
*  tasks that you want and this is sort of the big year where agents are starting to you know enter [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4124.88s)]
*  the vocabulary of enterprises of it people of you know larger and and certainly small organizations [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4130.64s)]
*  and and it kind of requires you to have a little bit of a of a reset moment on how you think about [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4137.92s)]
*  ai which is which is it's not just now a kind of a co-pilot that you talk back and forth with it's [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4141.84s)]
*  actually something running behind the scenes that's now actually starting to deliver you know real [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4147.28s)]
*  automated you know kind of work for you and so lots of implications like you know massive [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4153.04s)]
*  implications to what the software business model is in the future you know i i would argue you know [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4158.32s)]
*  strongly that's a massive tam increase because now software starts to go after labor spend it [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4162.56s)]
*  completely changes the dynamics of then you know how do you build a moat in a world of ai agents [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4167.84s)]
*  um uh but but i think that piece there and you said something very interesting [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4172.4800000000005s)]
*  how software then is going to go over human spend yes explain that concept yeah for a second [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4176.56s)]
*  david and i you know we we go back way back in sas land but like you used to basically just [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4184.08s)]
*  you know you built you built a piece of software and you sell it for the number of of people in [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4190.4800000000005s)]
*  the organization and so you know company has 500 employees and and you sell that thing for let's [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4195.04s)]
*  say ten dollars you know a user a month you know 120 bucks a year and you make 60 000 bucks and so [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4201.36s)]
*  so that's kind of the business model now when your software actually brings the underlying [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4207.6s)]
*  workflow to the customer or the underlying outcome to the customer so you know that that company [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4213.6s)]
*  might have 10 lawyers and so previously if you were selling software for lawyers you had a maximum [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4218.32s)]
*  amount of 10 seats that you could sell now all of a sudden if your ai agents are doing the equivalent [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4223.28s)]
*  of let's say paralegal work or some form of professional services all of a sudden you might [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4227.84s)]
*  be able to sell a multiple of the initial kind of 10 seats that you would have sold previously [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4232.08s)]
*  so you say that's a huge opportunity because now you're not enabling a human to be five percent [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4236.4s)]
*  more productive you're replacing a human or you're replacing one out of 10 yeah and actually i'm [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4240.88s)]
*  going to take a massive i'm going to do an underscore on this point though i i don't i [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4245.12s)]
*  don't like the word replace because i think actually most of the upside is actually going [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4248.24s)]
*  to be for companies that now deploy labor at things that they wouldn't have deployed labor [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4252.08s)]
*  at before and and you know maybe i'm biased from the view we have but most of our conversations [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4256.32s)]
*  with customers are when they have ai agents they can actually now go and actually deliver work [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4260.8s)]
*  in areas that would have been unaffordable previously so they actually they weren't doing [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4266.88s)]
*  the work is that true in logistics so like we we're making thousands of phone calls a day using ai [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4270.72s)]
*  calling truck drivers and we if we have a load we've got 400 000 truck drivers using the mobile app [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4276.48s)]
*  flexport mobile app i don't have enough loads to keep them all checking it every day to see if [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4282.08s)]
*  there's a load that matches them if they don't check it they're they're useless to me now and [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4287.5199999999995s)]
*  it was too expensive to call the truck driver and have a human call and talk to them even if it's a [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4292.16s)]
*  human in a call center in the philippines whereas with ai it's almost free i'm calling thousands of [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4295.84s)]
*  them a day going hey this load looks like it's a good match for you are you interested and then [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4301.28s)]
*  we activate them on the platform um that's new work that wasn't going to happen before not just [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4305.76s)]
*  a replacement yeah i think that i think probably i think like we have you know in the valley [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4310.56s)]
*  unfortunately we've been co-opted a little bit somewhat with with a little bit of a doomer [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4316.0s)]
*  you know mindset in some areas and and we think of then ai is okay like like it's all fixed pie [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4319.92s)]
*  it's going to replace things and on the ground with large enterprises the vast majority of the [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4324.72s)]
*  use cases are are it's it's the you know it's the ability to finally review the contracts that we [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4330.160000000001s)]
*  never got around to reviewing it's the ability to finally automate an invoice process that we never [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4335.6s)]
*  did it's the ability to go in and just create marketing campaigns in every language that we [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4339.36s)]
*  never got around to and so so i think that'll probably be actually like 90 of the usage of ai [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4344.639999999999s)]
*  in the future will be things that if we look back and we snap the line right now we said this is [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4349.599999999999s)]
*  what knowledge work is today 90 of ai usage will be things that we don't do today 10 will replace [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4353.5199999999995s)]
*  you know what we're what we're doing in some areas that's the right take because chamath i [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4359.5199999999995s)]
*  can tell you in our firm we would never have associates or researchers or analysts [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4364.400000000001s)]
*  sax you also were in this line of work as well venture capital you'd never have them review [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4368.88s)]
*  legal documents that's something lawyers would do in legal department but now because of ai we [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4373.04s)]
*  have them say here's the safe here's the term sheet here's the edited version dump it all in [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4378.0s)]
*  find out what the changes are what are the deltas here and and then let's have a discussion about [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4383.84s)]
*  what the founder changed in a standard document and we don't have to bother with an attorney and [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4387.76s)]
*  maybe you wouldn't have even checked those documents if you were you know a seed fund or [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4393.52s)]
*  an age old fund you would just go along for the ride because you're the 10th person signing the [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4397.360000000001s)]
*  document so what do you what do you think chamath here in terms of the premise that [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4401.200000000001s)]
*  maybe it's 10 replacing work that's happening but this is blue ocean and we're going to do 90 [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4405.76s)]
*  of like new stuff that we just never got to yeah i tend to i tend to believe that's true i think [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4410.160000000001s)]
*  the customers that we sell into at 80 90 are largely large enterprises as well so not dissimilar [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4415.120000000001s)]
*  to erin's customer base what i would say is that what they are encountering is the trough of [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4422.0s)]
*  disillusionment and i don't know if erin you're seeing this as well but every single you know cio [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4429.76s)]
*  ran around signing up some sort of ai product in large part because their ceo would say to them [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4437.28s)]
*  hey what's your ai strategy and the reason the ceo asked them that is that at some point somebody [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4445.68s)]
*  on the board said what are we doing about ai so that's the the bullsh** cascade that that that [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4450.96s)]
*  we went through in the last two years and i think what has happened now is people have spent billions [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4457.12s)]
*  and billions of dollars i think you can see it in the revenue traction of the ai companies [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4462.8s)]
*  but i think where we are today is that there are some real technical complexities that have not [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4469.36s)]
*  been solved i'll give you an example we have a lot of customers in regulated industries which is to [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4475.44s)]
*  say that if you make a mistake you will get fined or you will get shut down life sciences [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4480.88s)]
*  health care financial services are three examples people still don't seem to appreciate that when [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4488.400000000001s)]
*  you replace software that is deterministic with software that is probabilistic meaning software [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4495.6s)]
*  somebody wrote for you do a then do b then do c with an llm that can hallucinate you'll have [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4502.16s)]
*  errors so what used to be a throwaway thing which is quality assurance and qa right unit testing [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4513.04s)]
*  integration testing is now the only thing that matters why because if you're a financial services [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4520.48s)]
*  institution and you're supposed to do kyc and hit borx and now all of a sudden you send a wire [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4525.28s)]
*  somewhere in syria guess what you're in trouble why now if you're a health care company and you're [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4530.16s)]
*  supposed to do some clinical diagnosis to send out a drug on time and you don't do that because [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4535.92s)]
*  the the model hallucinates that's a real problem and i i'm guaranteeing you we have not seen [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4541.36s)]
*  the class action lawsuits that will come when those errors will eventually be made they're [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4549.68s)]
*  guaranteed to be made we just don't know the scope and the scale of them so that's why i'm [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4555.92s)]
*  sort of of this posture where i think we've sold in a ton of promise i think the reality is much [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4561.28s)]
*  more tactical it's a little bit more banal i think we're sorting through the exact use cases where [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4569.36s)]
*  you can put guardrails around these error rates where it's okay and tolerable like ryan will [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4575.6s)]
*  probably tell you there's some number of phone calls that just sound totally facocke [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4580.5599999999995s)]
*  but he's okay with that because the broader thing is okay and air me so i don't know so i want to [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4586.08s)]
*  talk to my customers though i have a calling truck drivers to offer them you know offer them [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4592.4s)]
*  loads but i'm not having to talk to my customer sorry i meant your truck drivers but my my point [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4596.959999999999s)]
*  just is that i think agents are real but i think that we are far away from that because we're still [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4601.44s)]
*  at the phase of how do you build reliable software in production for an enterprise [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4609.44s)]
*  versus the toy apps that you see on the internet which is like let me vibe code something i think [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4615.5199999999995s)]
*  these things are worlds apart still okay so let me get saxon on here and just to inform the audience [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4621.5199999999995s)]
*  you heard trow of dissolution this comes from the hype cycle this is something gartner has been [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4625.919999999999s)]
*  talked about for a long time so in case you're taking it for granted if you're watching you have [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4630.32s)]
*  some sort of technology trigger like agents you have this like peak of inflated expectations now [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4634.72s)]
*  we're in the trial of dissolution man hey this stuff doesn't work it's hallucinating but we're [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4639.52s)]
*  kind of going up it works it just doesn't work it doesn't say we're on the slope of the solution [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4643.280000000001s)]
*  man i don't know where this is coming from i don't even think we're at the peak yet oh okay so you [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4648.72s)]
*  think we're still going up because i i a lot of people to shimot's point were buying stuff and [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4653.52s)]
*  saying hey it doesn't work you know and now we're in the mess let me say let me say differently [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4658.0s)]
*  sax i think we have not yet figured out how to move the budgets from experimentation to mainline [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4662.88s)]
*  production meaning where large chunks of the u.s economy are comfortable enough with the ways in [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4669.12s)]
*  which hallucinations are managed such that they will replace legacy deterministic code with this [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4676.400000000001s)]
*  new probabilistic model generated code meaning model enabled code let's just put it that way [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4683.2s)]
*  actually though i don't we're on the slope here yeah look i would i would separate [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4690.16s)]
*  change management issues which are always going to be important and there's always going to be [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4694.639999999999s)]
*  big ones whenever there's a big disruption especially enterprise especially around compliance [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4698.88s)]
*  and legal all that kind of stuff i would separate that from the impact of the underlying technology [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4702.5599999999995s)]
*  trend and i don't think the impact has come anywhere close to peaking yet and in fact i [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4706.719999999999s)]
*  would say the rate of progress is exponential right now on at least three key dimensions so [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4713.68s)]
*  number one is the algorithms themselves the models are improving at a rate of i don't know [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4719.360000000001s)]
*  three to four times a year they're not just getting faster and and better but qualitatively [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4723.84s)]
*  they're different remember we started with pure llm chat bots then we went to reasoning models [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4729.92s)]
*  and the difference there is with a chat bot it's like kind of a smart phd or college student giving [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4735.200000000001s)]
*  you an answer off the top of their heads the reasoning models it's more like the phd saying [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4740.48s)]
*  okay let me go off and think about that let me do a project on that and it could work for 30 seconds [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4744.5599999999995s)]
*  or a couple of minutes i mean as much compute as you want to throw at it and it will break [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4750.16s)]
*  down your complicated question into a bunch of sub questions and then it'll try different approaches [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4754.16s)]
*  and it can validate some of those approaches and come back to you with a much more impressive [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4758.4s)]
*  answer and if you've been using like the grok 3 deep research or the new chat gpt 03 [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4761.679999999999s)]
*  to do these types of new reasoning models it's pretty mind-blowing what they're capable of have [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4770.48s)]
*  we even come close to figuring out how to tap the potential there especially in an enterprise context [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4775.599999999999s)]
*  no but my point is that the rate of progress on the algorithms is again three or four times [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4780.5599999999995s)]
*  let me just hold on here okay yeah okay go finish your box and then i'll take it and pass it go [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4787.599999999999s)]
*  ahead well i was trying to lay out the dimensions of which progress is proceeding exponentially [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4793.44s)]
*  okay so one is the algorithms okay which is not just quantitative it's also qualitative [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4797.68s)]
*  we didn't even get to the agent's part of it yet but that's the next big leap after reasoning [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4802.4800000000005s)]
*  models we're just starting to scratch the surface there then you've got the chips i mean the chips [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4806.4800000000005s)]
*  are getting better at i don't know three to four x a year we've gone from you know the h100 to the [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4811.76s)]
*  h200 now we're on the gb 200 will be a gb 300 soon will be on to ruben three times better per [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4816.8s)]
*  year or they get better three times per year no no no they're getting the chips themselves depending [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4823.84s)]
*  on how you measure it each generation of chips is probably three or four times better than the last [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4828.56s)]
*  okay and nvidia is back to rolling out new chip new generation of products roughly annually [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4833.52s)]
*  and i'm just using them as one example obviously there are other companies as well [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4840.16s)]
*  so basically the leap from hopper to blackwell to got it rubin i guess will be in next year and then [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4843.68s)]
*  i think five minutes coming after that i mean really an astounding rate of progress [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4850.08s)]
*  it's not just the individual chips are getting better they're figuring out how to network them [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4853.84s)]
*  together like with nvl 72 it's like a rack system to create much better performance at the data [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4857.04s)]
*  center level and that would be like the the third area where you're seeing basically exponential [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4862.72s)]
*  progress just look at the number of gpus are being deployed in data centers so when elon first [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4867.36s)]
*  started training grok i think they had maybe 100 000 gpus colossus was 100 000 correct right now [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4873.12s)]
*  they're up to 300 000 they're on the way to a million same thing with open ai's data centers [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4878.16s)]
*  stargate and within a couple years they'll be at i don't know 5 million gpus 10 million gpus so i [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4883.44s)]
*  mean and you see that on the power side right you're going from 100 megawatt data centers to [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4889.44s)]
*  300 megawatts to we're just starting to now see the first gigawatt power data centers i don't even [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4893.28s)]
*  think they're live yet but this is where they're trying to get to and i don't think it's beyond [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4898.8s)]
*  the real possibility that we could be at five or ten gigawatt data centers in the next i don't know [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4903.5199999999995s)]
*  several years so my point is just look the algorithms the chips and the data centers are [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4907.6s)]
*  all improving or scaling at a rate of i don't know three to four x a year that's 10 x every two years [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4914.0s)]
*  okay where people don't understand exponential progress is that if you're getting better at 10 [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4920.320000000001s)]
*  x every two years that doesn't mean you'll be at 20 x in four years it means you'll be at 100 x [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4925.360000000001s)]
*  100 x so the models the chips in the data centers will all be 100 times more powerful [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4930.0s)]
*  in four years let's say at the end of this presidential term so you multiply those things [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4934.8s)]
*  together the algorithms the chips and then the raw compute that's available you're talking about a [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4939.68s)]
*  million x increase some of which will be captured in price reductions some of it will be in the [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4945.76s)]
*  performance ceiling and then some of it will just be in the overall amount of of ai compute that's [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4951.4400000000005s)]
*  available to the economy but the impact of this thing is going to be absolutely massive and i [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4958.64s)]
*  think people still don't even appreciate that fact because they don't understand exponential [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4963.36s)]
*  progress yeah and i think maybe just to square the circle though the because because everything is [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4966.24s)]
*  that you just said taxes what i think is propelling the industry and then the reality on shimaz side [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4971.759999999999s)]
*  like like just just to connect the dots so we have an eval test that we do where we run enterprise [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4976.96s)]
*  data through every model to kind of figure out its accuracy rate and and you know how much it's not [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4983.759999999999s)]
*  even hallucination but just literally how much data does it miss when we ask for facts the best [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4988.88s)]
*  model in the world actually interestingly we was grok three on on this particular test we send it [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4993.12s)]
*  500 documents and we asked for 40 data fields back from the documents and so it has to get every [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=4998.8s)]
*  single data field correct and we only do a single pass so we send the document to the to the model [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5003.76s)]
*  we get a single pass back right now the the best score is about 90 percent and so you can imagine [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5009.599999999999s)]
*  a number of industries where you can't have 90 accuracy you know if you give something you know [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5015.28s)]
*  a question on 40 data fields now there's ways to solve it is you rerun it multiple times or you [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5020.32s)]
*  chunk up the document into smaller parts and so it doesn't get confused by the large context window [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5025.5199999999995s)]
*  but a lot of the people that were deploying ai a year ago or a year and a half ago weren't doing [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5030.48s)]
*  that and so they they you know they did have a kind of a pilot run of something and it kind of [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5035.12s)]
*  worked okay and what they have to realize back to your point sax is like this space is literally [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5040.4s)]
*  exponentially you know changing and so if you don't use the the latest methods of okay you have [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5045.6s)]
*  to actually like run the data through the model multiple times and you have to chunk up the data [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5050.240000000001s)]
*  into smaller parts and you have to use a reasoning model and you have to make sure that your your [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5055.200000000001s)]
*  prompt is like hyper tuned for the particular use case if you haven't done those four things [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5058.88s)]
*  then you probably will actually end up with a project that fails and and even so even when [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5062.96s)]
*  you do all those things for even you know harder problems you know you're still going to run into [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5067.6s)]
*  issues so i think i think the challenge is that everybody's running a million miles an hour right [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5071.280000000001s)]
*  now and they're trying a lot of things some work some don't work at the same time that the space is [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5074.8s)]
*  actually you know you know changing at a pretty you know kind of crazy rate and let's take a look [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5079.4400000000005s)]
*  at our partner polymarket and which company they think will have the best ai model by the end of [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5084.24s)]
*  2025 and get feedback from our panel on if you think this is accurate and who you would pick here [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5089.52s)]
*  looks like google is in the lead here 41 percent of people believe that they will have the best [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5096.08s)]
*  ai model by the end of the question what is what is the dimension like you know we use gemini so [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5105.52s)]
*  for many tasks at 8090 we use gemini it's incredible but for most of our cogen we use [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5110.88s)]
*  anthropic and claude kicks ass it's it's exceptional this is uh based on the best scores in the chat bot [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5115.6s)]
*  arena which just became a for-profit company so that is slightly different because people have [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5122.8s)]
*  gamed those tests so that is a rub there people are now building their a model for the aval unit [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5127.92s)]
*  right all the models are way overfitted for these evals so but if you had to pick who's your i mean [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5134.08s)]
*  so i guess chamath you're saying you have to take a task by task it's what depends on task i agree [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5137.84s)]
*  what sac said is right so it's kind of like what what problem are you trying to solve and then you [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5142.320000000001s)]
*  have to ride this technology wave that is compounding very quickly all i was just trying to get across is [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5146.8s)]
*  that the error rates have been diminishing but not nearly as fast as you need for some sectors of the [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5151.2s)]
*  economy right so you can use a model to generate deterministic code that's great and as long as you [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5156.24s)]
*  unit test it and integration test it it'll be fine but i'm saying if you're going to use a model in [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5162.16s)]
*  production in an environment where if stuff goes wrong there are consequences we're not we're not [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5165.92s)]
*  there yet right you don't want to use this for health care yet so you could use it for writing [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5172.88s)]
*  or writing jokes or maybe tagging a file that's too binary like it's already used right now in [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5177.92s)]
*  health care but it's just the doctor's meeting notes that that would normally take 30 minutes [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5184.32s)]
*  to go and transcribe yeah yeah so so it's you can't be too too black and white on that one [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5188.72s)]
*  yeah what's happening right now the reason why the the progress is so rapid in coding assistance [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5192.96s)]
*  and i i think you know you're right that entropic with was a claw 3.7 yeah i think they're the leader [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5198.56s)]
*  and in fact i think the manas demo that we showed it's not entirely a wrapper on clawed because [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5206.0s)]
*  they actually they do a number of different things but i think they are significantly using [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5210.8s)]
*  entropic for the code assistant part of it in any event the reason why the progress is so rapid [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5214.24s)]
*  with coding is because code compiles and you can determine objectively whether it works or not you [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5220.56s)]
*  can validate it and so that makes it a perfect area for ai to get better at through reinforcement [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5226.96s)]
*  learning and test time compute is ai tries a bunch of things it sees what works it sees what [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5234.16s)]
*  compiles sees what the user then accepts and then to be able to learn to iterate based on that that's [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5238.5599999999995s)]
*  why coding right now is really the big breakthrough application and use case but it's not going to be [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5243.92s)]
*  the only one i mean math is another good area where i think ai is improving rapidly again because [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5249.12s)]
*  math you have proofs and you can look at the results and see if it validates now i think one [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5254.48s)]
*  of the big questions in terms of ai progress is how extensible is the progress to other areas [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5261.12s)]
*  that don't easily validate that way so for example legal work is i think a really good area for ai [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5266.32s)]
*  but how do you validate that is correct you would have to go to a court right the court is the [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5274.48s)]
*  compiler like a lawsuit or maybe the laws or you could hire like a thousand lawyers or experts in [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5278.16s)]
*  area to basically do you know reinforcement which people are doing human people are doing [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5284.96s)]
*  human feedback but it's not like a compiler to your point it's not like a it's not going to [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5290.0s)]
*  the progress isn't going to be as rapid because it's harder to validate but absolutely but my [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5293.12s)]
*  guess is that once they figure out how to nail coding math and the things that are easily validated [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5296.88s)]
*  they can move to the things that are harder to validate and but i think this is one of the big [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5302.88s)]
*  questions is whether i think people will just kind of assume that ai progress will be you know equally [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5307.84s)]
*  fast in all areas and i think it's possible that ai gets really good in some areas better than human [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5313.2s)]
*  but it's sort of childlike in other areas and narrow task is like make your point right like [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5318.48s)]
*  with a finite answer or an answer we know is the definitive answer but this is the important thing [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5324.16s)]
*  about the agent kind of you know let's just say framework or architecture you know momentum was [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5330.72s)]
*  was instead of just saying okay we're going to do a single pass through the model and then whatever [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5338.08s)]
*  it comes back with is is we're going to be satisfied like you know the legal work might be [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5341.76s)]
*  might be reviewed by another agent whose job is to review legal work and so we can just throw more [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5347.52s)]
*  and more compute at the problem and we're just early in figuring out how to architect those [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5353.04s)]
*  or multiple models right you could have you would have you would have tropics you'd have entropic [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5357.280000000001s)]
*  check and then tpt check gemini yeah when you have some anomaly it spits back out to the user so human [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5362.24s)]
*  in the loop still matters in this in type of process in the early days of ocr you would have [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5367.2s)]
*  a computer say here's the characters in this legal document then you'd have two humans type it in and [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5371.76s)]
*  then you would get a certain level of certainty you'll quickly find that when you layer these [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5376.16s)]
*  models on top of each other the test time compute costs are astronomical yep and erin's probably [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5380.72s)]
*  dealt with this like it's like i get a bill from aws and it's like oh wait hold on a second i just [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5386.08s)]
*  you know per hundred thousand this month what's going on so you have to get to the bottom [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5393.36s)]
*  that by the way is another major trend line which is that the new applications that we talked about [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5397.759999999999s)]
*  are all much more token intensive so we went from basic lms totally you know which don't require [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5402.0s)]
*  that many tokens to give you an answer to the reasoning model where you can spend a thousand [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5408.0s)]
*  times more tokens just getting one answer to a question and now the agents are going to be even [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5411.92s)]
*  more token intensive than that so the amount of compute required to serve all these new applications [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5416.8s)]
*  is going to be massive which is why i think the capex build out actually makes sense when you do [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5422.400000000001s)]
*  a deep research to your point david you're firing off maybe 200 queries and it's asking the ai is [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5426.88s)]
*  saying hey what query should i ask on behalf of the user and then you go down that rabbit hole [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5432.4800000000005s)]
*  it's basically doing 200 of them at once ryan your thoughts here on ai first companies and [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5436.4800000000005s)]
*  agentic computing well the one i really wanted to tie back to is actually our earlier conversation [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5442.16s)]
*  on tariffs and there's a real use case of a of lms is how do you classify a product and you'd [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5445.84s)]
*  like to get to what we see today when we did our first machine learning based natural language [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5451.76s)]
*  classification of a product you take a product url listing page a shopify page or amazon page [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5458.16s)]
*  and say hey what what classification code is this what duty is owed six years ago in a hackathon we [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5462.96s)]
*  got to like 70 accuracy we're now in high 90s accuracy versus what a human trained expert will [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5468.72s)]
*  get to but you actually get to it which is not good enough you know you're wrong three percent of [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5475.84s)]
*  the time you know you might have committed a violation of the law for sure but actually what [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5480.4800000000005s)]
*  is truth in that regard it's there's a lot of gray area in this and truth ultimately is what [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5485.280000000001s)]
*  does custom say what does the cbp determine is correct and those guys are using software [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5489.76s)]
*  right that's pretty that's a very simple algorithm and it's a decision tree that's going okay is it [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5496.88s)]
*  a shoe yes is the top made of leather yes you know is the bottom made of rubber and they just [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5501.679999999999s)]
*  go through a very simple and that outputs it so on some level if you convince the government to [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5506.96s)]
*  use your lm it becomes true whether it's true or not i think there's going to be some interesting [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5511.679999999999s)]
*  cases like that that we haven't really thought through of like when does the government adopt [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5516.4s)]
*  these to be the source of truth okay all of this speaks to this thing that's going to sound totally [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5520.16s)]
*  esoteric but like we all used to shit on qa right like the least talented engineers were allocated [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5525.36s)]
*  to qa i think in the world of ai it's it'll end up being the most talented you know we internally [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5533.36s)]
*  at 8090 we call it improvement engineering and it's a total specialty it's similar to when i [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5539.36s)]
*  kind of coined the growth team at facebook i feel it's the same kind of moment where improvement [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5545.92s)]
*  engineering is really the skill that translates toy apps and vibe coding into something that's [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5550.96s)]
*  very practical and real and we like and my team and the leader of this team he's like steeped in [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5557.6s)]
*  things like japanese kata management from like toyota and quality systems and these are all the [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5563.92s)]
*  things that matter when you're trying to just shrink the error rate down to zero so that you [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5569.12s)]
*  can use it in a reliable way and also to document it so that if people want to question what happened [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5574.0s)]
*  or have you know recompense or some some way to come back and say hey that that really harmed me [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5580.48s)]
*  how do you even do that like these are all very complicated issues that that will get sorted out [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5587.28s)]
*  super i think interesting okay four i gotta wrap guys i gotta catch a flight to miami let me do a [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W960TW79QCI&t=5592.639999999999s)]
