# E146 Did the Fed break the VC model? Plus IPOs, M&A, revaluing unicorns & more
**All In Podcast:** [September 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g)
*  Did you just finish a good cry because you have this wetness right here on your eye? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh, sorry, I just got out of my cold plunge in my sauna because you know, I hit a new record low weight 169 this week [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  What's your temperature on I don't want to say it's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=11.16s)]
*  It's embarrassing. I don't know. What is it? I've been doing like 56 [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=14.8s)]
*  58 but it's great. It's okay. I mean all these lunatics like I don't know there are 45 degrees 48 degrees [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=19.84s)]
*  I think it's unnecessary you get the same value. I think if my two-year-old does 56, it's good. It's really impressive. I [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=25.9s)]
*  Consider an 80 degree pool to be a cold plunge [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=32.22s)]
*  Saxon's house there's no difference between [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=41.42s)]
*  Rainman David's [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=55.9s)]
*  Yes, it's a schvitz it's crazy and then I went in my infrared sauna [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=67.98s)]
*  So now I've been going in you do the cold then the warm [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=71.98s)]
*  I think you're supposed to do warm than cold. No, they say end on cold and so I've been ending on [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=75.18s)]
*  Yeah, but I just do like a site to do cold warm cold [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=80.18s)]
*  Cold warm cold. Yes, I'm now like two minutes ten minutes two minutes or what do you do? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=84.1s)]
*  Yeah, exactly like one or two minutes cold plunge four minutes you warm up you get back to it and then you jump back in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  You know, it works pretty good, you know, I have to say my energy level goes way up. Have you been tracking your blood pressure? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=95.44s)]
*  I have not but I have this [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=101.86s)]
*  Executive health coach that I'm using and so that's where I got those ridiculous glasses the blue lights and my sleep's better [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=105.22s)]
*  I got some I'm taking some supplements. I'm eating estrogen [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=111.84s)]
*  No, I [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=122.88s)]
*  Had an all-time high for me, you know you guys it just oozes on to me. No, it turns out, you know [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=125.0s)]
*  Even at 52 my testosterone is very high. So that's what is your free testosterone? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=130.32s)]
*  I don't have the number here, but they said it's the the high end of normal [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=134.6s)]
*  So I was like should I be shooting up testosterone? They're like no, you're good [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=137.74s)]
*  You're good. Just we'll send it over to free Berg. I said, okay great [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=141.8s)]
*  I'm gonna go to free Berg talking a lot of people take [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=145.16000000000003s)]
*  Testosterone in their 50s and 60s and I've had a couple of my friends in their early 60s start each is it HGH? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=148.08s)]
*  Human growth. Yeah, is that right? Not a good idea seems like a really bad idea that off menu stuff [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  I don't think it's a good idea. I [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=161.88000000000002s)]
*  Think you gotta be careful with the off menu items. I think you can get a prescription for it. Is that right? Yeah [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  I know there's a lot of menu items available to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=169.38s)]
*  Affluent people with the right doctors and I don't think it's a good idea. I mean you guys see Bezos. He's jacked [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=172.94s)]
*  I didn't bring up anybody specifically, but he looks great. I think that's just all weights [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=178.46s)]
*  Is he gonna be president? I [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=185.42s)]
*  mean [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=188.3s)]
*  If you had your choice right now between Bezos and Bob Iger, who would you try to buy in? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=189.42s)]
*  I think we know who you'd pay. I [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=194.7s)]
*  Mean listen, I was talking to some affluent people and they everybody's going [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=197.7s)]
*  People I don't want to say who but Vivek is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=203.3s)]
*  Now people are starting to talk the thing. I think he's hitting the right chords man [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=206.66s)]
*  Vivek is about to pass to Santas. He will be I think if you look at the polling right now [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=210.74s)]
*  New Hampshire, he'll be the clear number two in [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=216.66s)]
*  About four between four and eight weeks from now. That's crazy. That's crazy [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=221.26s)]
*  and so I think if he becomes a clear number to the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=226.46s)]
*  The think of this it's like then all of a sudden all these MAGA [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=229.9s)]
*  supporters are [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=234.5s)]
*  Given Trump and then Trump with some small feature improvements that are actually pretty meaningful, right? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=235.82s)]
*  And then they're like, well, do I want the 80 year old Trump or do I want the 38? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=241.86s)]
*  Right with like the super features, you know [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=247.62s)]
*  I can forgive all of his other issues when he tells me that he's gonna cut the government the federal government by 75% [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=250.0s)]
*  75% my gosh sold so you're on so you're on team Vivek. I want to continue to gather a little data [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=256.38s)]
*  There's no rush to make a declaration right now. Give me a little bit of time. Chum up. Are you with Vivek? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=262.4s)]
*  Yes, I and and the reason is I would love [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=266.97999999999996s)]
*  for it to be [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=270.26s)]
*  RFK and Biden in a debate and then Trump and Vivek in a debate so that I could really [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=271.65999999999997s)]
*  Figure out between RFK and Vivek who I would like to vote for [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=277.34s)]
*  But I think it's been pretty clear that the Democrats have chosen to railroad RFKs candidacy [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=281.78s)]
*  It's unfortunate because I don't think we're given a real fair shake and really being able to evaluate him [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=287.32s)]
*  Yeah, even the the tractors like Freeberg you have some pretty significant things that you dislike about RFK, which I think are fair [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=292.85999999999996s)]
*  They're never gonna get a chance to get aired out because you're never gonna get a chance to be put on a national platform [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=300.56s)]
*  Where there will be really enough debate and I think that's where [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=306.58s)]
*  America loses [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=311.82s)]
*  So yeah in that context [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=313.18s)]
*  I would say that Vivek has done more in the last month to convince me that he is fiscally responsible and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=315.29999999999995s)]
*  that he [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=322.06s)]
*  Has some intuitions that I think RFK and Trump and a lot of people in America share [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=324.21999999999997s)]
*  which is just about the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=331.02s)]
*  usefulness of the blob [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=333.7s)]
*  you know that there maybe needs to be a grand experiment where we deconstruct the blob and [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=336.5s)]
*  I'm for that experiment to be totally honest with you to see what happens. Sax, where you at? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=341.97999999999996s)]
*  He's unhappy what I would say. I think it's too early in the process to say definitively [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=348.21999999999997s)]
*  Okay, this person has to be the person for me. I'm viewing candidates as either being acceptable or unacceptable [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=351.97999999999996s)]
*  and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=358.06s)]
*  Vivek is acceptable to me. I think DeSantis is too [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=358.97999999999996s)]
*  The ones who are unacceptable to me are the ones who would escalate this Ukraine war because I think that avoiding World War three is [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=363.3s)]
*  To me the central issue of the campaign [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=369.62s)]
*  So for me, it's just a litmus test issue [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=372.3s)]
*  I can only support a candidate who would work to end this war not one who had escalated [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=374.66s)]
*  Where does our fiscal emergency sit for you in terms of priorities? So no World War three priority one is the fiscal emergency that we're facing [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=379.38s)]
*  Priority two or is it overstated by me do you thank or others? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=387.74s)]
*  No, I think it's important but the problem is this is that in order to do something about that problem you really need [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=390.54s)]
*  bipartisan support [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=398.54s)]
*  Yeah, because it would be suicide for one party to try and do all the heavy lifting without the support of the other and I just [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=399.62s)]
*  Don't see in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=405.06s)]
*  The near to midterm that you're gonna get that kind of bipartisan support no matter who is president [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=406.70000000000005s)]
*  Whether it's a Democrat or a Republican the only issue that for sure [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=411.78000000000003s)]
*  The American president has unilateral discretion over is our foreign policy and so for me [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=416.38s)]
*  Making sure that the next president pursues a foreign policy that [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=423.78s)]
*  Doesn't result in the destruction the United States that to me is the overwhelming issue [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=427.58s)]
*  It doesn't mean these other issues aren't important, but look at how some numbers are [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=432.5s)]
*  Let me show you this poll for a second just so we level set with the audience [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=436.18s)]
*  Poll ending September 18th 20 23 for those who are not watching on YouTube Trump 39% is that or 38 then the vague [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=439.5s)]
*  13% Haley 12% Christie 11% [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=447.78000000000003s)]
*  DeSantis 10% [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=451.1s)]
*  That is a stunning turn or yeah, that's probably cuz it's New Hampshire Jake how but you know no I know [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=453.46000000000004s)]
*  It's just but that's a very critical state right I mean sex [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=458.42s)]
*  What do you think about what Dahlia said on stage about the need to have a Manhattan project style effort here? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=461.26s)]
*  That is bipartisan comes to the center and tries to resolve this as that scale of an emergency [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=469.02000000000004s)]
*  Is that realistic to kind of frame this as we are in a fiscal emergency? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=475.18s)]
*  We have to get a Manhattan project style effort underway to try and engineer a solution [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=480.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, let's back up first of all [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=483.82s)]
*  I think you asked the right question to him which is is our decline a matter of physics? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=485.14000000000004s)]
*  You know due to forces we can't control or is it something we still have control over and I think that that's a really good [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=489.66s)]
*  Framing I think if you're in the bucket that we can do something about it [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=496.58s)]
*  I mean I believe that we can the question is how and [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=499.94s)]
*  I think his view was that somehow you get all these elites together and you get them on the same page [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=503.5s)]
*  I don't think that's how our system works [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=507.94s)]
*  I think what happens is you have elections people compete against each other and then voters decide who's right [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=511.62s)]
*  and so one side has to defeat the other and [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=516.88s)]
*  I think until we get some clarity from voters on the direction they want to go [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=520.7s)]
*  I don't think there's gonna be a resolution but to your point, there's no solution without bipartisan as bipartisanship here [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=524.58s)]
*  So what is the path to bipartisanship when it comes to the fiscal crisis? I'm not sure wouldn't the obvious thing be if one party wins [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=530.96s)]
*  With that as part of their platform then it becomes part of the winning platform in the winning formula [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=538.1s)]
*  We're just saying that's not even possible because it's too unpopular to tell people that they don't get free money [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=542.76s)]
*  I think it's political suicide for one party to [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=547.4200000000001s)]
*  Engage in deep cuts deep government cuts deep cuts of programs, especially popular programs [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=551.12s)]
*  you probably cut the unpopular ones at the margins, but [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=556.3000000000001s)]
*  Political suicide to cut anything important without having the other party on board [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=560.08s)]
*  There's been a couple of times where we've been able to have this type of consensus [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=563.6s)]
*  I mean the one that always gets mentioned is when Reagan and Tip O'Neill cut a deal and they were able to reform [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  entitlements and make some changes to those programs and they kind of did it arm-in-arm and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  That worked and then the other time where it kind of happened [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=579.52s)]
*  Not through agreement, but almost through lack of agreement was when we had the sequester [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=583.64s)]
*  remember when Obama was president and what happened is the Democrats and [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=588.56s)]
*  The Republicans worked out a deal where if they couldn't agree you would get [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=592.88s)]
*  equal cuts in both military spending and [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=597.8s)]
*  Social spending the idea being that Republicans one of the military spending the Democrats wanted the social spending and that's ultimately what happened [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=601.0799999999999s)]
*  Is that they couldn't agree and so you got the sequester and we had some spending restraint for a short period of time [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=608.44s)]
*  The problem now is that both Republicans and Democrats? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=614.16s)]
*  Want more military spending? [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=618.44s)]
*  I don't hear anybody really argued for cutting military spending except for maybe Rokana at our event, but [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=620.44s)]
*  The Democrats are completely on board with war now and then on the social spending [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=626.72s)]
*  I don't think either party really wants to cut social spending either or do entitlement reform [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=630.62s)]
*  So there is no constituency out there for reining in [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  The biggest sectors of government spending so I don't see how it's gonna happen no matter who the president is [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=639.04s)]
*  Well, the forcing function will be the debt service costs [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=644.84s)]
*  Which is just crossed a trillion dollars a year just to pay the interest and it's mounting right 30% of our debt [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=647.32s)]
*  I think is coming up for refinancing in the next 12 months and that's gonna refinance at a 5% rate [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=652.72s)]
*  That's where the markets are at just like consumers can ignore it Friedberg and put their fingers in their ears and said la la la la la [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=658.08s)]
*  I don't have to worry about my payments then the payments show up and you got to worry about them [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=664.04s)]
*  Same thing's gonna happen here in the US, right? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=668.36s)]
*  The federal budget will get naturally constrained at some point here [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=670.16s)]
*  But yeah as the economist Herbstine once said if something can't go on forever [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=673.0s)]
*  It won't so I think I think you're right Friedberg that this is a yoga bearer [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=678.0799999999999s)]
*  It's not your new bearers. It's herb sign. I think yeah, if something can't go on forever, it won't I think that [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=682.8s)]
*  That's where we're headed is we're gonna have restraint imposed on us from the outside [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=687.64s)]
*  It's not gonna come from people stop buying bonds people stop buying treasuries interest rates just have to go up to [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=692.36s)]
*  What's happening in Japan? Right? I mean their bond auctions have been very [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=697.72s)]
*  lukewarm and supposedly a lot of the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=703.08s)]
*  Money in Japan is coming West looking for opportunities to get alpha. So we have an example that we can look to [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=706.2s)]
*  Alright, let's get we can get started here. We've got so much to talk about [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=713.28s)]
*  I think we got to give some flowers here last year the Sultan of science the Prince of panic attacks [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=715.6800000000001s)]
*  The Queen of quinoa was an absolute terror when I did the all-in summit [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=721.64s)]
*  2022 and then this year he was an absolute all-star in delight [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=727.0s)]
*  What an amazing job you did on the content people are saying the content that all-in summit 2023 is the best conference ever had [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=731.68s)]

*  Thought number one were my outfits [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=797.52s)]
*  Pretty great. I mean you did do an atha change twice a day. So congrats on that [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=800.7s)]

*  Thank you Friedberg and there is a Laura free book shafted me on my room. What what? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=836.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I got it put you by the garage. No, I got a room that was [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=842.3s)]
*  Well, it's very appropriate that these rooms exist, but it's handicap accessible which totally fine [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=847.18s)]
*  Except the problem is the the closet and everything is set for wheelchair height [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=852.24s)]
*  Why didn't you change your room dude? And so all Mike and that's why I thought oh, he just fucked me on purpose [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=857.4s)]
*  He just tried to he told you little passive aggressive name check. So you guys got some work to do in the group therapy chat [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=862.0s)]
*  I would never do that to you guys. Don't worry when I when I organize this summit [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=868.28s)]
*  I'll make sure these details are perfect. I fly on two months plane [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=872.2s)]
*  He has gluten-free Nutella crepes handmade in the morning and I stick him in a handicapped accessible room where he can't even put his bag [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=874.6800000000001s)]
*  And I can't put my clothes except without it touching the ground [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=881.4399999999999s)]
*  So then I had to play them on the bed and then I had to lay them on the so I'm just a first world problems [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=884.9s)]
*  Yeah, the audience right now is just [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=889.24s)]
*  Triggered by the suffering that you went through at the Beverly Hills Hotel. My honest reaction was I thought the content was really inspiring [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=892.12s)]
*  I guess it's kind of like I knew what I was gonna get up front with so many of the folks because I knew them [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=898.0799999999999s)]
*  But then where I still came away where they exceeded my expectations number one [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=903.9599999999999s)]
*  Probably was Graham Allison [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=908.68s)]
*  I could literally talk to him for eight hours a day. I feel like and [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=911.04s)]
*  I don't know him well [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=915.12s)]
*  So I felt like I was scratching the surface of the things that he knew I could do an entire dinner [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=916.8399999999999s)]
*  I think where he could just walk through the Cuban Missile Crisis and I could just sit there listening. So I thought he was unbelievably [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=922.36s)]
*  Intellectually stimulating for me [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=929.5999999999999s)]
*  Every time I sit down with Toby [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=933.04s)]
*  I'm just like in awe of how smart and different Toby Lutke is [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=935.5999999999999s)]
*  And so I always kind of like walk away thinking [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=941.48s)]
*  This is really one of the very special entrepreneurs of our generation just in terms of his mindset [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=945.92s)]
*  Underrated I thought Larry had the line of the summit Larry Summers [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=951.4399999999999s)]
*  where he said [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=955.64s)]
*  Self-esteem [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=957.92s)]
*  Should come from achievement and not the opposite which is that achievement should come from self-esteem and he was talking about [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=959.5999999999999s)]
*  Woke ism and sort of like the entire philosophy around that stuff right now [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=966.48s)]
*  And I thought that that was really insightful. Those are probably the three moments [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=970.88s)]
*  I thought girlies obviously presentation was superb [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=974.48s)]
*  But again, it's kind of like saying the obvious because it was just so masterclass [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=977.4s)]
*  But the from what I expected to what I got those were the three that I thought were the most [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=980.44s)]
*  inspiring and [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=986.28s)]
*  Net new positive for me fantastic sax [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=987.88s)]
*  Did you have any moments aside from when it's Paltrow saying she was your friend? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=991.44s)]
*  Saying she was your favorite bestie other than that being the clear number one for you and crushing soul crushing for us [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=995.36s)]
*  well, I never even heard that because the [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1002.12s)]
*  Zoom sound issues we had technical issues during her interview and it got really hard to hear her at various points [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1005.6s)]
*  And I don't think you guys heard that either, right? I [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1011.7800000000001s)]
*  Heard I tried to ignore it. I tried to block. I couldn't I couldn't hear it. So I didn't know that [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1015.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well congratulations of that. We could we keep that up right here. No, we're not doing victory laughs on the pod [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1019.32s)]
*  We talked about this on the chat. No, I mean, that's awesome. Go go for it. I'm here [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1024.92s)]
*  Oh my god, she said love with David's side. No, it's that his her husband thinks that she's [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1038.04s)]
*  This is not good [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1052.8400000000001s)]
*  David is incredible the husband's jealous and that's not a good situation [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1055.3200000000002s)]

*  Oh, well, actually the issue is I asked David sacks to show up at 845 for the run-through in the um [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1074.88s)]
*  He won't respond to me. Can you can you get in touch with him? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1080.0s)]
*  I said, let me tell you what's gonna happen with David sacks [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1082.56s)]
*  Programs gonna start at 9 he'll be here at 856 [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1085.2s)]
*  And if you get him on stage for two out of three talks [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1088.72s)]
*  You did better than I did [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1091.52s)]
*  And free birds team which god bless the production board team. They did an amazing job. These Wolverines are incredible [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1093.56s)]

*  And sure enough sack shows up at 856 goes on stage and he crushes it [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1106.08s)]
*  So great job getting him on stage, but congrats on showing up for they wanted me [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1110.58s)]
*  I mean I asked when's the first speaker going on stage? Yeah, actually he was 10 a.m. Right 10 a.m [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1115.06s)]
*  Sorry 10 in 10. So I'm like, okay my head I'm thinking okay, I'll be there in 959 [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1120.5s)]
*  Yeah, and then they're like you were there 955 and I was like, they said either 830 for a sound check and I'm like [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1126.42s)]
*  Jagger come for the sound check. What? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1133.94s)]
*  I'm sorry [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1135.94s)]
*  Start the show [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1143.94s)]
*  Look I thought the conference was amazing it exceeded my expectations [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1147.94s)]
*  Hmm your conference exceeded my expectations to Jake out, but I think free bird took it to another level [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1151.8600000000001s)]
*  Yes, exceeded my my already high expectations. Yeah, you know highlights [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1156.46s)]
*  I mean, I think starting with Ray Dalio as the first speaker was really interesting [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1161.02s)]
*  I think we only got to go for what 30 40 minutes with him [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1165.06s)]
*  I felt like we could have gone for two hours to bring it back on the pod and [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1168.26s)]
*  You know drill into that topic more two hours with Dalio would be amazing [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1172.3799999999999s)]
*  Because I think what's really interesting is the way that he's looking at the grand sweep of history, right? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1177.34s)]
*  He's thinking about not just a 10-year business cycle or a 75 year debt cycle. He's looking at a 250 year [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1181.94s)]
*  Empire cycle. I think this is really interesting that he thinks in that really big way. I [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1189.42s)]
*  Agree Graham Allison really interesting we could have spent two hours with him Larry Summers [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1194.38s)]
*  These are all people I think we should bring back on the pod for a long-form conversation. I [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1198.98s)]
*  Agree that Bill Gurley's talk was one of those great [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1204.22s)]
*  Ted style talks that I think should go viral. I think it has you know, I think people should watch that [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1207.9s)]
*  Yeah [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1213.38s)]
*  I mean the people retweeting it are incredible and I was at a dinner party last night and everybody was talking about it [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1213.66s)]
*  It's spread into our industry and it's starting to tip over into other industries already the chess was really fun [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1219.7s)]
*  I am a game day player that way, you know, I [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1225.2600000000002s)]
*  Managed to win the game. Oh [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1229.7800000000002s)]
*  I know there were a lot of great moments. I'm sure forgetting about things. I love that. I love that [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1234.1000000000001s)]
*  Parties were incredible [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1238.7800000000002s)]
*  The parties were absolutely incredible. We miss both of you guys at the Grimes DJ set. That was amazing, by the way [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1241.9s)]
*  I think your mouth was there for them. Weren't you there? No, I left right at 10 to fly back to [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1247.3s)]
*  The Bay Area early night. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, she Grimes [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1252.5s)]
*  Thank you to joint Grimes for doing that for me a personal favor the audience lost their minds sent him out [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1255.94s)]
*  She was incredible. She's such a performer. It's incredible. Yeah people were losing their minds [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1261.5s)]
*  For you free Berg best moments on stage. It was just great to be with everyone and go through it [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1266.62s)]
*  I mean, honestly, I didn't source all these speakers you guys did and so I don't want to take credit for that [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1271.9s)]
*  I think it was what I had hoped, you know, I went to Ted for 12 years [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1276.6599999999999s)]
*  I started going to Ted I think 2007 and I felt pretty disappointed [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1280.78s)]
*  Over the last couple of years and I actually spoke to the CEO of Ted and said I'm not gonna go anymore [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1284.06s)]
*  because so much of this the talks became kind of [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1290.06s)]
*  Social justice type talk nonsense that I wouldn't I don't want to use that term because I do think it's all very well intentioned [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1293.82s)]
*  And I think it just became overwhelming that you would go to Ted and you would basically [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1300.7399999999998s)]
*  Feel bad about yourself and [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1305.1s)]
*  That it kind of missed the element of the world is an amazing place [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1308.1399999999999s)]
*  We should have a great degree of optimism with technology and where it's taking us [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1311.8999999999999s)]
*  We should observe the greater cycle and the bigger perspective of things that are happening in the world [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1315.6399999999999s)]
*  Not kind of go into a who done it and who's to blame and us versus them kind of mentality [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1320.22s)]
*  Which I think so much of the stuff turned into at Ted and I was really hoping we could capture some of that [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1325.62s)]
*  And so I'm really glad we got a lot of the speakers we did and had a couple [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1330.3s)]
*  Hours to be able to share, you know those sorts of perspectives. So it was fun [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1336.06s)]
*  I really enjoyed what you did with the conference in terms of the editorial direction was great [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1340.42s)]
*  you leveled it up certainly from last year as Tramont pointed out correctly and [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1345.1200000000001s)]
*  It had a great amount of optimism realism and we didn't talk about [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1349.26s)]
*  superfluous virtue signaling [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1354.82s)]
*  Social justice woke nonsense that really is should not be at the top of the agenda in my mind [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1357.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying that these issues are not important to some people [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1363.24s)]
*  But I think prioritizing what's important in the world is what I got out of the conference, you know [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1366.74s)]
*  When you have people on this level [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1371.8799999999999s)]
*  Speaking for for you know, very long periods and not long enough, but you know that Larry Summers and and you know [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1374.6599999999999s)]
*  Ray Dalio [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1382.74s)]
*  I mean like I these talks they really gave you a sense of this is what's important in the world right now [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1383.74s)]
*  This is the priority and I came away from it. So intellectually stimulated. Maybe just say hey, you know [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1388.7s)]
*  I want to travel more. I want to read more [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1394.9s)]
*  I want to have more conversations and I have been basking in that like afterglow. So I just want to say, you know, once again [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1396.5800000000002s)]
*  What an extraordinary amount of teamwork just as the moderator of our quartet [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1404.3400000000001s)]
*  Great job moving the ball around. I think everybody was on their game everybody, you know, I'm talking about the three of you guys [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1409.82s)]
*  Very focused on just knowing exactly when to insert a great question [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1416.54s)]
*  So I felt like we were playing basketball like the Warriors when they play prime basketball ball moved really well [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1420.1399999999999s)]
*  Great questions people picking up on themes [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1426.94s)]
*  Threading themes from one talk to the other and it just made me really excited for next year [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1429.94s)]
*  So I just want to say great job to each of you [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1434.1s)]
*  Thank you back at you no back at you listen we could talk about ourselves all day, but [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1436.1799999999998s)]
*  People hate that. Let's talk about what's going on in the markets. Yeah, we only did it for 40 minutes. Okay. Yeah exactly [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1440.8999999999999s)]
*  IPOs and I'm an a on fire. We've had a ridiculous week [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1446.9399999999998s)]
*  Six quarters of down market has suddenly [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1451.54s)]
*  Turned into a bunch of green shoots on the M&A front Cisco [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1454.8999999999999s)]
*  Announced it was going to be a great year for the market [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1460.4599999999998s)]
*  M&A front Cisco announced it acquired Splunk for [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1463.54s)]
*  Twenty billion dollars in an all cash deal if the notes are correct here. It's about 10% of Cisco's market value [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1468.34s)]
*  Somebody did a trade where they they bought a bunch of options and so that looked a little fugacy [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1475.78s)]
*  Congratulations to Nancy Pelosi on that trade possibly [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1481.74s)]
*  Don't forget your favorite word allegedly allegedly [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1486.7s)]
*  Allegedly perhaps I don't know she's good at trades [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1489.46s)]
*  So if somebody's gonna make money on that trade or somebody's go to jail [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1492.66s)]
*  So congrats to Screlli instacart Clavio and arm all IPO in the past week [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1496.66s)]
*  And you know, they've fallen back to earth [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1504.74s)]
*  Just crazy stat 21 months since the last [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1507.38s)]
*  significant venture back company went public [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1511.6200000000001s)]
*  I'll leave out like the Middle Eastern food company was a Kava that went public and then the [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1513.8200000000002s)]
*  Vacuum company that went public but that's just in the past seven days. So we talked about this on the program [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1519.42s)]
*  We discussed hey, we'll know when the markets are back if some of these companies are forced to walk the plank slash [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1525.1000000000001s)]
*  Get public, you know and and fix their cap tables and sure enough [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1532.96s)]
*  Instacart really kind of represents that most most of the late stage investors in instacart are underwater the early stage folks [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1537.18s)]
*  Absolutely crushed it Chamath listen your your [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1544.7s)]
*  Market expert here you've taken a lot of companies public [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1548.82s)]
*  What do you think the last week means for the greater technology industry? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1551.82s)]
*  I don't think that this was the great reopening that we all were hoping for I [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1556.74s)]
*  think it's important to understand the dynamics of [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1563.98s)]
*  bank-led traditional IPOs in America and the best way to [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1568.1799999999998s)]
*  Understand them is to contrast and compare to how that same company would go public in Europe or Asia [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1571.78s)]
*  Because it'll explain what what happened and I think unfortunately what has happened is not good for the market [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1577.74s)]
*  So typically what happens is when you construct an IPO you're selling 15 to 20 percent of the company [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1582.38s)]
*  and [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1589.7s)]
*  When you do that you go and you call [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1591.02s)]
*  Hedge funds and you call these mutual funds, but what are called long-onlys, right? Meaning they don't short [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1593.5s)]
*  They just go long these big mutual fund companies and you try to find a handful of people to anchor the IPO [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1598.46s)]
*  so they take a huge piece of that 15 to 20 percent and [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1605.8600000000001s)]
*  In Europe and Asia the securities law says that when you get such a big allocation [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1610.6200000000001s)]
*  You have to hold it for six months, which means you're treated [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1615.66s)]
*  Exactly the same as the employees who are typically locked up in an IPO for at least six months [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1619.82s)]
*  And so what happens is these firms do all kinds of diligence and [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1626.7s)]
*  When they buy something it's because they really believe in it and then they go long it for you know [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1631.46s)]
*  What is at least half a year? So it's a it's a non trivial amount of time [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1636.3999999999999s)]
*  So that's what happens in Europe and Asia 15 to 20 percent of the company is sold a handful of people anchor and you're locked [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1640.34s)]
*  Up for six months now. You need to look at how American IPOs are done, which is why people have experimented with direct listings [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1646.82s)]
*  We've experimented with SPACs. It's because the fundamental architecture of IPOs are [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1654.22s)]
*  Broken they're set up in a dynamic where it's a heads. I win tails [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1660.06s)]
*  You lose situation for the bankers that run the IPO now what happened in these three IPOs? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1665.58s)]
*  Number one, it was less than 10% of the float [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1672.54s)]
*  So highly highly highly concentrated small amount of the of the company was made available for sale [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1675.34s)]
*  Number two there really weren't anchors [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1683.22s)]
*  What happened was the allocation of that less than 10% was smeared across 50 or 60? [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1686.5s)]
*  different organizations and then number three there was no lockup which meant that people could sell right away and [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1693.02s)]
*  So what you saw with all of these companies was the exact same dynamic which was it opened [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1699.66s)]
*  because there was such a small amount of supply it traded up and [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1705.74s)]
*  The minute that retail which typically tends to be late to the game because they don't have access to these things, right? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1709.34s)]
*  When they started buying [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1715.26s)]
*  What was unique this time around is all of the mutual funds just dumped everything. Hmm, and [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1717.34s)]
*  The hedge funds were like well, we don't have a real allocation our friends said in the group chat [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1723.02s)]
*  He got a five or ten million dollar allocation in these IPOs [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1727.7s)]
*  These are twenty and thirty billion dollar hedge funds five and ten million dollar allocations. Don't move the needle [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1731.46s)]
*  So the hedge fund sold right away and got on the sidelines and said I don't care about this [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1736.98s)]
*  The long onlys bought just enough to make the stock go up because of such a small supply then when retail stepped in they just [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1741.98s)]
*  dumped it all and [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1748.36s)]
*  So unfortunately, what's happened is all three IPOs within a few days have breached their issue price now [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1750.18s)]
*  They're at the same issue price may be slightly higher, but that is an unsuccessful dynamic [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1756.8999999999999s)]
*  What could have been different the banks could have? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1762.94s)]
*  Forced these companies to sell up to 20% [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1766.34s)]
*  the banks could have found a few anchor buyers the banks could have [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1768.86s)]
*  created a lockup structure for these anchor buyers they did none of it and [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1773.6599999999999s)]
*  So the result is a lot of downward pressure [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1777.58s)]
*  in a moment where the overhang of rates has have come back and [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1781.3s)]
*  Are forcing all of us to realize and we all talk about it in the second that these rates are going to be higher for [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1785.74s)]
*  longer which completely changes how you value these tech companies so [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1790.82s)]
*  Net net very poor IPO construction by the banks and [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1794.58s)]
*  This the grand reopening was a grand closing I think okay [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1799.4199999999998s)]
*  So just to put some numbers on that Instacart's float was six point seven percent and Clavius float seven point six [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1804.1399999999999s)]
*  Arms float almost hit the ten percent nine point four, but certainly less than the twenty percent that you would expect [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1809.86s)]
*  so then they guess the follow-up question here at Saks is why did these companies go out and [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1815.2199999999998s)]
*  Will we see the the other big ones go out the stripes and some of the other backed up inventory? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1821.0600000000002s)]
*  What's what's the back channel in our industry about the viability of other IPOs? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1826.5s)]
*  Is this going to push a lot more people out to get liquidity? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1830.8200000000002s)]
*  Even at discounted prices even with the headwinds that Chumot points out or is this going to have a chilling effect? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1833.8600000000001s)]
*  And people are going to say you know what let me wait till 2025 so I think they went out because [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1839.46s)]
*  Investors and others need liquidity and there's no point holding on and waiting for a valuation [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1844.18s)]
*  That's never going to come back. I mean, so you take Instacart for example their last private round was at 39 billion [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1849.3s)]
*  What's the market cap now around nine nine? [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1855.06s)]
*  So it's great that they got out. I think that is eight today. It's an eight [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1858.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean that look it's sort of a green shoot that they got out, but we're never going back to the valuation levels [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1862.6599999999999s)]
*  So we had a couple years ago during a giant Zurp created asset bubble [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1868.6599999999999s)]
*  So I just think there's no reason to wait and you look at SoftBank [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1873.62s)]
*  They needed the liquidity from the arm IPO. Yeah, so I think that's why these companies are going out is it's we're kind of getting back to business as usual [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1876.98s)]
*  Just to broaden out the question a little bit [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1882.98s)]
*  What I think is interesting is that for the past year or so we've been in a software recession [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1886.9s)]
*  It really started in the first half of 2022 the markets cratered especially for growth stocks [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1892.5s)]
*  There's a huge correction in valuations that happened in [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1897.7s)]
*  Especially the first half of 2022 [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1900.9s)]
*  But then about a year ago, so starting in mid-22 and continuing through q2 of this year [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1903.38s)]
*  You saw a reduction in growth forecasts. Everybody started forecasting down [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1909.46s)]
*  There wasn't a single board meeting that I was in in private companies that wasn't missing their numbers and reforecasting down [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1915.22s)]
*  And you saw it in the public companies as well. I think German Ball substacks showed that the average [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1921.7800000000002s)]
*  growth forecast for Saturday [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1928.02s)]
*  Companies for next 12 months have been cut roughly in half [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1930.02s)]
*  So for the last year year and a half, we've been in a software recession [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1934.18s)]
*  You could say a b2b recession. We saw companies like meta [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1937.94s)]
*  Google and so on cut thousands of jobs [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1942.42s)]
*  Tens of thousands of jobs, you know get much more efficient [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1945.62s)]
*  Each that meant they were buying a lot less software on a per seat basis [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1950.02s)]
*  So I think we've been through call it a b2b recession [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1953.78s)]
*  But the thing that's held up stronger than I think people might have expected over the past year has been the consumer [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1957.14s)]
*  Consumer spending has kept the economy afloat [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1962.42s)]
*  So the b2c part of the economy has been strong whereas b2b has been very weak what I wonder about next [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1965.6200000000001s)]
*  Is whether that's going to flip. I wonder if the consumer is on their last legs here [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1972.42s)]
*  You see that credit card debt is at an all-time high [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1978.1000000000001s)]
*  Interest payments on credit card debt all-time high mortgages the rate now is approaching 8% [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1981.86s)]
*  So no one can afford to sell their house, which has a 3% mortgage and then buy a new one at 8% [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1987.86s)]
*  So real estate transactions have cratered [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1993.2199999999998s)]
*  The commercial real estate industry is you know on its last legs [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=1996.1s)]
*  I think they're starting to throw the keys back to the bank and start forfeiting buildings because they can't refi it a track record [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2000.34s)]
*  So I think the real estate industry is on its last legs [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2005.78s)]
*  So I just wonder if the consumer now is about to go through the type of pain [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2009.78s)]
*  And restructuring of their personal balance sheets the way that the enterprise segment of the economy did over the past year [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2014.8999999999999s)]
*  Freiburg your thoughts on what we're seeing here in terms of the IPO window companies getting out [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2021.3s)]
*  And the impact that'll have maybe on how limited partners look at venture funds [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2028.34s)]
*  That's been frozen for 18 months limited partners and i'm raising a fund right now publicly under 506c so I can talk about it [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2034.6599999999999s)]
*  And it's going great, but man, it's a lot of meetings and i'd say [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2041.6999999999998s)]
*  Two-thirds of the meetings i'm having people are saying we're not adding managers [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2045.6999999999998s)]
*  We're cutting managers and we're cutting commitments to managers, but we'd love to meet you know, just to start the relationship, you know [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2050.34s)]
*  So what do you think this means overall for the limited partners? [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2056.34s)]
*  So what do you think this means overall for the limited partner gps and the startup market [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2060.7400000000002s)]
*  Start of a turnaround or maybe just sideways for more [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2068.5s)]
*  I guess we should just put the volume in context if you look at this slide [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2071.94s)]
*  This is from earnston young showing the uh ipo activity by year and this was through june 30th [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2078.1000000000004s)]
*  So if you assume kind of a steady state [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2084.6600000000003s)]
*  You probably are going to come in at a volume that's less than 22 and and perhaps even less than going back all the way to 2019 [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2087.22s)]
*  With less than 1200 ipos during the year compared to the peak of 2400 which happened in 2021 [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2095.54s)]
*  And if you go to the next slide and just look at the total dollar volume raise so that ipo proceeds [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2102.74s)]
*  Thus far through june 30th of this year is just around 60 billion [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2108.18s)]
*  Uh compare that to a total of about 180 billion [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2112.42s)]
*  all of last year [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2117.14s)]
*  450 billion in 2021 [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2119.2s)]
*  And the ipos we're talking about today instacart clavio [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2122.2599999999998s)]
*  Arm in total raised about five and a half billion dollars [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2128.18s)]
*  so, you know that kind of [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2132.42s)]
*  Doesn't have a huge consequence on this dollar volume for the year [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2134.66s)]
*  And then if you look at what's in the pipeline right now in terms of what's publicly filed as s1s [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2139.0600000000004s)]
*  There's basically nothing right now [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2144.9s)]
*  So I think everyone's kind of sitting around waiting to see how these transactions go before they decide to put other stuff [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2147.6200000000003s)]
*  I think the big mistake [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2153.6200000000003s)]
*  Is that we continue to treat ipos as this big yardstick? [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2155.86s)]
*  The real yardstick for a business is the performance of the business [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2160.5800000000004s)]
*  And the valuation you get when you raise capital at some point in time is largely driven by market conditions [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2165.22s)]
*  Not necessarily by the performance of the business and the value of the business over time [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2171.3s)]
*  The market will do its job and rightly value that company [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2175.54s)]
*  We've talked at length about how much value has accrued as a public company for apple for microsoft for google 99.9% [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2178.98s)]
*  Of their total market value with realized post ipo. So the ipo transaction I think it's a little too much weight [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2186.5s)]
*  And gets a little too much attention in terms of determining success or failure of a business [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2194.18s)]
*  And success or failure of the investors in that business [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2200.02s)]
*  So I really hate this whole thing about does the ipo price go up on a day. It's this really [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2202.8199999999997s)]
*  Weirdly engineered thing that they try and do to drive psychology and marketing [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2207.8399999999997s)]
*  By banks to go out and they the banks to try and get people to give them more capital or to give them more deals [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2212.2599999999998s)]
*  In the future. Do you think that the ipo market would be better served if banks were forced to be locked or the [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2217.8599999999997s)]
*  The allocations were forced to be six month block like the employees, of course [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2223.3s)]
*  Maybe longer what if they were if they were locked for seven people? What do you think? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2229.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, where would the float come from on day one? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2233.86s)]
*  But why do you need a float? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2236.98s)]
*  yeah, I mean that's that's a good point I I believe the direct listing should be the way that you do this and then you do a [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2238.82s)]
*  um a follow-on offering once your share trading the problem with the direct listing [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2243.86s)]
*  As I found as a seller [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2249.46s)]
*  Because I went through a handful of direct listings. I went through slack and I went through coinbase coinbase, right? Yeah, and in the slack direct listing [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2252.18s)]
*  I only sold a small portion on day one [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2261.06s)]
*  And it turned out to be a mistake and the reason was because the pricing of a direct listing forces you to find [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2264.26s)]
*  the absolute highest price at the open [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2271.78s)]
*  Now I we learned [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2275.62s)]
*  That so then going into the coinbase ipo what all the venture investors did was distributed [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2277.7799999999997s)]
*  Literally the day before and the day of the direct listing right so that you would get delivered your stock [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2284.1s)]
*  At the highest price so that you could sell [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2290.1s)]
*  I'm, not sure that that serves [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2292.74s)]
*  Anybody any better? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2295.62s)]
*  You know what? I mean because then you get a lot of price volatility and the price just goes straight down [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2297.2999999999997s)]
*  So I don't exactly know what the answer is. I suspect though that [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2303.7799999999997s)]
*  Getting companies to float at least 15 to 20 percent [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2308.42s)]
*  And doing a better job of allocation so that you're right david removing the psychology of like it has to go up 100 [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2312.18s)]
*  On day one is success is the thing that actually catches these companies off guard now [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2320.1s)]
*  We haven't even talked for a minute about whether any of us thinks [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2324.98s)]
*  The quality of instacart and clavio and arm are good businesses and this is part of it as well [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2328.8199999999997s)]
*  Exactly, you just spent 15 or 20 minutes [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2333.62s)]
*  Debating the stock price that is completely divorced from the reality of these businesses [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2336.02s)]
*  And that's a bunch of distraction that the banks create as well that are that is totally unnecessary [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2340.5s)]
*  I mean, what do you guys think about these? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2344.98s)]
*  Let me just respond to the direct listing point. I just want to also point out spotify [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2348.1s)]
*  Went public via direct listing the stock actually traded up after the direct listing [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2352.58s)]
*  It went down a little bit after but it continued to trade up, you know into the 2021 era [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2356.66s)]
*  And today it's trading at or above what it was trading at during the direct listing [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2361.38s)]
*  So can I tell you why though the performance of that business fundamentally? [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2364.98s)]
*  Drove interest from investors the thing with the spotify ipo was that it was still a very new vehicle [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2368.98s)]
*  And so that direct listing was we were all learning as we went along [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2374.42s)]
*  And at the end of the day there was one bank that kind of not cornered the market [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2378.18s)]
*  But really became an expert on it and they use spotify as the example [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2381.7799999999997s)]
*  So by the time slack and then coinbase came along [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2386.1s)]
*  The playbook was so tight that everybody knew how to play the game [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2389.3799999999997s)]
*  So I think a lot of the spotify post ipo behavior [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2393.8599999999997s)]
*  Was a bunch of people figuring out what a direct listing meant by the time that we actually dled slack and specifically when we dled coinbase [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2398.18s)]
*  The bank was so sophisticated in telling us here's what's going to happen. Here's what you should do [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2406.1s)]
*  What do you want to do? And obviously we wanted to do the thing that maximized returns for our lps [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2410.8199999999997s)]
*  So i'm not sure that the spotify example will ever repeat in a direct listing. I think that the slack and [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2415.78s)]
*  Coinbase particularly will be the example going forward. You'll top tick day one and then the thing will spear down find a bottom [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2423.7000000000003s)]
*  And then why does it matter? Why isn't it ultimately about finding the real market value for the company? [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2430.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't matter [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2435.38s)]
*  It doesn't matter that the price goes down or goes up that ultimately the buyers that want to pay a certain price will step [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2436.5s)]
*  In and buy and the folks that want to sell because they think the price is higher than their mark will want to sell [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2441.3s)]
*  I agree with you. I do think that it's really about business fundamentals, but there's a lot of people that [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2445.46s)]
*  Get caught up in the price as what the quality of the business is now [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2452.26s)]
*  Those people are maybe not the most sophisticated people in the world [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2456.26s)]
*  But they make a lot of noise for not knowing what's going on [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2459.2200000000003s)]
*  And so they can be a real distraction to a ceo trying to run a business. I remember [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2462.5s)]
*  In 2008, I think i've told you guys this story. It was like november of 2008 [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2467.38s)]
*  Expedia was trading down to seven bucks and I saw dara at some event in [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2472.58s)]
*  March, yeah march and he said hey our stock's at seven bucks. I can't believe it [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2477.62s)]
*  I mean like everyone should be buying our stock and that was well off of the price that it had been trading at in [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2480.8199999999997s)]
*  0304 05 [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2486.66s)]
*  And sure enough [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2489.8599999999997s)]
*  If you had bought that stock, you know, you would have made 15x [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2491.7s)]
*  From there to where we sit today and even more if you sold at the top take in 2021 [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2495.7s)]
*  So, you know these yeah, that's a that's a good chart. So look at where expedia was in in march of [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2500.3599999999997s)]
*  09 was right around seven bucks [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2505.3999999999996s)]
*  And I think that that was for me like the first example where I really understood [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2508.2799999999997s)]
*  That the price where the market trades a stock [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2513.3999999999996s)]
*  Shouldn't matter as much as the fundamental value of the business if you're willing to be a long-term holder if you're willing to say [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2517.08s)]
*  You know what? You're willing to do the work and you have to do the work [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2522.2s)]
*  Yeah, most people are not willing to do the work. They want to look at a price [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2524.9199999999996s)]
*  And then they want to imbue [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2528.7599999999998s)]
*  All of their own psychological desires into it versus what are the actual ones and zeros of a spreadsheet tell you [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2531.16s)]
*  Yeah, but i'm like a pure efficient market guy. I feel like the you know, whatever shares should be [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2537.72s)]
*  People want to sell they should be able to sell whatever people want to buy should buy the market and if the stock gets too cheap [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2542.44s)]
*  There's plenty of capital out there to step in and buy the stock if they think that it's too cheap and the market will find [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2547.72s)]
*  Itself, so let's do the underwriting of instacart then where any of you guys investors in instacart? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2552.2s)]
*  No, they're any I am in a fund. That's an instacart [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2557.0s)]
*  From the seed round so I will do I think very well because of that [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2561.56s)]
*  Uh, let's bleep that out. Thank you. Uh [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2566.92s)]
*  that's [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2569.7200000000003s)]
*  That will be a that'll be a yum yum for jcal [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2571.0s)]
*  But let's just talk about revenue. Yeah, but actually when it trickles down all the way to you as an lp. What's the real multiple? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2574.1200000000003s)]
*  I guess you know if you take out the carry 25 or 30 less than [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2581.88s)]
*  What looks like to be i'll tell you the game the whole fund first. So [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2587.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that that fund's been paid back many times over already [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2591.6400000000003s)]
*  So that you know what the multiple is on that fund for you. Yeah, it'll it was eight million invested [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2594.1200000000003s)]
*  and [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2600.36s)]
*  No, that's their investment. That's not your investment. Yeah, what if no, I know if you look at your investment [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2601.56s)]
*  What my understanding is that investment's going to be? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2607.0s)]
*  Uh 200x 100 or 200x somewhere somewhere in that range. I'll I will report back [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2609.88s)]
*  But I think the seed round investors are going to be hold on so so you're saying eight million will become 1.6 billion [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2614.84s)]
*  I think it's over a billion. We can actually have a chart here. Let's take a look at [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2620.84s)]
*  Let's assume it's a billion 1.6 seems a little high. Let's say a billion [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2624.6800000000003s)]
*  But let's say the fund was what five six hundred million [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2628.6800000000003s)]
*  So for the lp, it's like a 2x [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2631.96s)]
*  I'm just saying that yeah for the fund it was 100x but for the lp, it's a 2x [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2635.88s)]
*  I think that's a big difference right funds already in the black. So [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2640.36s)]
*  Minigating fact. Okay, so it's two extra turns [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2643.7200000000003s)]
*  Of your investment, uh meaning if it was a 4x jason, he's saying that it'll become a 6x. Yeah [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2646.84s)]
*  Yeah, something like that. Yeah, I mean it's a good fund. I'm not disparaging it [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2653.08s)]
*  But I just i'm just trying to set things and put things in proportion. I think I think at this point that funds at 21x [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2656.28s)]
*  Right now [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2662.04s)]
*  Something in that range. So it's a pretty great fund [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2663.32s)]
*  In terms of total it'll go to 23x something to that effect. Yes, it's going to be pretty amazing [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2666.76s)]
*  What else was in there? [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2673.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that was [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2674.84s)]
*  Instagram [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2678.66s)]
*  And whatsapp were also in the fund either before it or with it. So that's a pretty good fun [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2680.44s)]
*  There were two funds. Uh, I wouldn't say which firm this is. Um, what? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2685.2400000000002s)]
*  12 and 24x I I believe is the last time I checked in on whatsapp was a monster [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2689.86s)]
*  That was a really well everybody learned from whatsapp. Um, and you know, shout out to the sakoi team [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2694.52s)]
*  doug leone, I think and [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2700.6s)]
*  They did every round. Jim. Gethse did that one. Yeah, they did every round [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2703.32s)]
*  So it was an internal round for I think four rounds in a row [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2707.7200000000003s)]
*  So they just made preemptive offers the reason whatsapp was a home run is because it was so capital efficient [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2710.84s)]
*  Yeah, it didn't burn that much. They didn't raise that much. So there's very little dilution. Yep for everybody [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2717.56s)]
*  I mean whereas and I think that's the problem with instacart is how many billions do they have to raise? [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2724.12s)]
*  Let's pull up this chart here [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2728.2799999999997s)]
*  This is super telling to pull up, you know who made money and I think this shows you what happens in a serp [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2730.2s)]
*  Environment when people do not look at entry price [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2736.1s)]
*  The series c underwater. No, no series c not under water everybody [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2739.08s)]
*  from f on is kind of underwater, uh, and everybody from the [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2743.48s)]
*  Series c is underwater compared to the smp 500 to your party free free bird [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2748.6s)]
*  And then everybody who invested in 2020 and 2021 actually lost money [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2753.88s)]
*  general caddus dst [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2758.12s)]
*  D1 t-row fidelity all the late stage folks even sequoia was in that late stage at series i in 2021 when it was worth 39 billion [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2760.2s)]
*  So but that whole environment not only was it bad for all the late stage investors who invested at too higher price [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2768.68s)]
*  I would argue that [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2774.6s)]
*  It was bad for the companies and even their early stage investors because these companies got so inefficient [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2776.68s)]
*  The dilution is ridiculous. Yeah [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2782.3599999999997s)]
*  Hello, dilution was ridiculous [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2784.6s)]
*  I also think you have to think about this in the context of what your alternative returns are [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2786.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that we always look at these numbers and we think we try to make judgments [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2791.96s)]
*  But if you put yourself into the mindset of an investor [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2796.52s)]
*  It's actually the alternative of what you could have gotten and it's the spread between the two that's really important [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2800.76s)]
*  So nick, do you want to just throw up this image that I just sent you? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2806.6800000000003s)]
*  This is an example that I saw in axios. I thought that this visualization by the way [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2809.4s)]
*  I want to try to use this visualization in the future [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2813.64s)]
*  Because it tries to really it just paints a very clear picture. Let's let's sports [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2816.7599999999998s)]
*  This picture shows is essentially and this uses instacart as an example, but you could use it for any company [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2821.24s)]
*  But it just basically shows you at every point in which you could have invested money in instacart [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2826.92s)]
*  What would the equivalent return have been had you just invested that same amount of money in the s&p 500? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2832.12s)]
*  And the difference between that is what you would call the alpha, right? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2837.64s)]
*  Because the s&p 500 is the beta meaning it is what the market's going to do. It'll be up 10 percent [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2841.72s)]
*  It'll be down 4 percent, whatever and so by owning the market [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2848.12s)]
*  You get that [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2852.3599999999997s)]
*  If you decide to not own the market and make an explicit decision like owning instacart [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2853.8799999999997s)]
*  Then you get a different return stream and if you compare the two, you know how much better or worse you would have been [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2858.3599999999997s)]
*  So what this chart shows for example is the series f investor in 2018 [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2863.48s)]
*  If you had taken a dollar and put it into instacart would have gotten 13 percent [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2868.78s)]
*  But if you had put a dollar into the s&p 500 you would have gotten 68 percent [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2872.38s)]
*  In the series c in 2015 had you invested a dollar in instacart? You would have made 153 percent [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2878.1400000000003s)]
*  But the s&p would have returned 121 the difference means that the series c investor [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2885.34s)]
*  Generated about [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2891.32s)]
*  32 alpha [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2893.4s)]
*  Now then the decision you have to make is that 32 percent of incremental gain [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2896.04s)]
*  over the last [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2901.8s)]
*  Seven years or eight years [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2903.88s)]
*  Was it worth it? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2906.44s)]
*  You're not liquid and because you have to then solve for illiquidity and other things and this is the math that I think [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2907.88s)]
*  All of the lps will be engaged in they'll be doing these calculations [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2914.36s)]
*  It just goes back to what sax's point said which is [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2918.44s)]
*  our business [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2921.32s)]
*  Frankly did very well in moments where we had zero interest rates [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2922.76s)]
*  our business now when [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2927.32s)]
*  prevailing rates are at five or six percent [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2929.88s)]
*  And you can own those things or you can own structured credit for 11 to 13 percent [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2932.76s)]
*  Our business unfortunately does not look so good [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2937.96s)]
*  And when people do the calculations on what the true alpha of venture capital is they're going to come back with answers like this [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2940.36s)]
*  Which is it's not that great [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2946.6000000000004s)]
*  And I do think it will impact how limited partners have an appetite to give all of us or you guys folks that are that are [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2949.3199999999997s)]
*  Accepting lp checks more money because the alternative universe is more liquid [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2956.7599999999998s)]
*  It's less volatile [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2963.64s)]
*  And it has roughly the same amount of return. I can tell you what they're saying because i'm doing [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2965.72s)]
*  About a dozen lp meetings a week and i've got 50 more on the calendar to the end of the year [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2970.2799999999997s)]
*  So i'm going to hit 100 of these meetings. They're really saying two things one. We want to go earlier [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2975.32s)]
*  We don't want to go later as that chart proves [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2979.6400000000003s)]
*  They're suddenly fascinated with the seed in series a rounds [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2982.52s)]
*  And they're looking for distinctly [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2985.88s)]
*  different strategies [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2988.76s)]
*  They're looking for some sort of edge [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2990.76s)]
*  So the first two questions are how early are you getting in and securing a 10 position in this company? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2993.0s)]
*  And then what's your edge and literally the start of my pitch deck now when I walk people through it is [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=2998.6800000000003s)]
*  I have two podcasts [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3004.6s)]
*  One of them gets 50 million listens a year the other one gets over 50 million listens a year [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3006.2799999999997s)]
*  Those 100 million listens result in 20 000 applications. I have larger deal flow than anybody [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3010.36s)]
*  With the only exception being y-combinator and that resonates with pokes. Um, but if you're somebody who's got a new fund and you're like [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3015.4s)]
*  What's your what's your edge? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3023.0s)]
*  Yeah, I go to you know, some demo days. That's not an edge [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3025.16s)]
*  You have to have a massive competitive edge and a differentiation you have to be differentiated in some [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3029.0s)]
*  Very credible believable way and they're telling me the same thing [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3035.56s)]
*  They're cutting two funds out of their 20 and then they're cutting their commitments to the weaker ones of the other 18 [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3038.76s)]
*  I have a question for all of you guys. You had a wonderful question, which we never touched guys [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3045.0s)]
*  What do you guys think about the arm business model or the clavio business model? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3048.1200000000003s)]
*  Have you guys had a chance to look at any of those companies and think about that? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3053.56s)]
*  Let me take up the facts and then you guys respond [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3056.68s)]
*  The revenue is up 15 percent year over year 716 million ad revenue is 206 million [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3059.0s)]
*  That's on pace to make up 28 percent of their revenue. This is just the last quarter [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3064.52s)]
*  I'm talking about it right here ended june 30th net income 114 million. They have 600 000 instacart shoppers [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3068.92s)]
*  Those are like, uh the drivers you can think of them like door dashers or uber drivers [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3075.0s)]
*  7.7 million monthly active orders the red flags is that their gross transaction volume [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3079.62s)]
*  Which is the value of all of the groceries in the in the bags is flat [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3084.52s)]
*  But ad revenue is growing this means ad revenue is just a massively larger percentage of the total revenue [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3088.6s)]
*  they think they can you know, they're on track for 800 million in ad revenue, so this is starting to look not like a [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3095.0s)]
*  ecommerce business but more like a [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3100.28s)]
*  an advertising business your thoughts [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3102.92s)]
*  Freiburg or sax on the actual car business amazon by the way has that dynamic too now have you seen the chart showing [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3105.2400000000002s)]
*  Advertising on amazon compared to the entire internet. Yes, it's huge and also [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3111.64s)]
*  Uber's blown past a billion. I believe here's what we know. We know that advertising multiples broadly speaking have contracted [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3116.8399999999997s)]
*  Right. So I think that the market in general [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3124.2s)]
*  Doesn't love that revenue quality [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3127.0s)]
*  Because it's too levered to interest rates in the economy [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3129.64s)]
*  So when the economy does well more companies advertise when the economy doesn't do well companies advertise less [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3133.08s)]
*  That's number one [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3139.64s)]
*  And number two the ones that can systematically drive advertising more broadly [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3141.16s)]
*  the face books and the googles of the world tend to get an increasing share so [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3145.3199999999997s)]
*  Advertising as a revenue stream. I think is is good and complementary [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3149.2999999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately, the markets don't necessarily love it [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3153.3199999999997s)]
*  and then the second thing generally speaking for these businesses that drive huge gtvs gross transaction values is [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3156.2799999999997s)]
*  I think most people when they try to find what they're worth [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3163.64s)]
*  Are very sensitive to the take rate [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3167.08s)]
*  And what they typically do is they assume a falling take rate [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3169.64s)]
*  Which means what percentage of the transaction can you get and the reason why most people do that is that [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3174.2799999999997s)]
*  History has shown that these kinds of businesses [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3179.88s)]
*  Cannot defend take rate for a very long period of time [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3182.92s)]
*  Whether it's for competitive pressure or whether it's because their suppliers actually develop more pricing power [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3187.4s)]
*  Or take rate tends to decay [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3193.08s)]
*  so said in you know in grocery land, I think it's because walmart and [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3196.12s)]
*  amazon [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3201.16s)]
*  Will try to do it for much much cheaper and or charge [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3203.0s)]
*  Just be more aggressive in how much they they want to keep which means it's less that you can maybe necessarily pass through [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3207.48s)]
*  I don't know the instacart business at all. But if I were starting to look at it, that's where I would focus is [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3215.08s)]
*  What are the assumptions on take rate? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3219.96s)]
*  And if the take rate is going up and it would be a little bit of a head scratcher. I think that you have to [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3222.2s)]
*  Model the health of the business with a declining take rate and growing share [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3228.12s)]
*  Yeah, I can actually build on that pretty easily having spent a long time in the advertising market [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3231.56s)]
*  If this was very profitable advertising chamath, it would get a 25 [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3235.96s)]
*  x uh multiple on earnings. Let's take that 800 million [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3241.08s)]
*  You put it at 400 million in profits like if the other business didn't exist [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3244.68s)]
*  So you have 400 million in profits of advertising times that by 20 you get 8 billion [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3248.2s)]
*  That's exactly their market cap. So it perhaps what you're saying is exactly what [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3253.96s)]
*  The market is is actually penciling out google, which obviously has a lot of other technologies. I think a 28 x pe [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3259.72s)]
*  And facebook is crushed it like a 35 pe but these are much different scale and scale matters [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3267.4s)]
*  This is not one or two billion in you know, a little extra [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3274.92s)]
*  Revenue on top of your business. That's the entirety [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3278.36s)]
*  90 95 percent of I think what's working in favor of instacart is that if you compare it to [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3281.7200000000003s)]
*  Probably uber and door dash or airbnb at least [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3286.36s)]
*  airbnb dash [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3289.64s)]
*  I'm going to guess [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3291.32s)]
*  That it looks pretty cheap. Now. I think of all the three businesses dash probably has the biggest upside [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3292.68s)]
*  Quite just like again parm's length. I don't I don't own any of these three stocks [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3298.04s)]
*  I'm just saying business model quality dash seems infinitely scalable [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3301.72s)]
*  Airbnb I think probably has [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3307.62s)]
*  Long-term issues would take because of this exact reason could just competitive dynamics and pressure regulatory capture [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3310.8399999999997s)]
*  You're seeing that in new york for airbnb [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3317.56s)]
*  and then the question is [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3320.04s)]
*  What is the business outside the united states look like for instacart? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3321.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't know [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3326.2799999999997s)]
*  But if I had to figure out what to pay for it, that's how I would [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3327.32s)]
*  Kind of try to break the problem down sax any your thoughts on the in the actual business here [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3331.0s)]
*  Or do you want to jump over to clavia? Yeah, I think uh clavios here the really interesting one at least from my standpoint [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3334.84s)]
*  Because it's a software business [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3341.32s)]
*  I think jason limkin had the take here [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3343.2400000000002s)]
*  He said that clavios ipo will be the ultimate yardstick for sas in 23 and 24 [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3345.48s)]
*  Top growth top margins top founders going to cruise past a billion [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3350.84s)]
*  In arr whatever multiple they end up trading at your home is certainly worth less. I think it's trading at about 12 times [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3354.7599999999998s)]
*  for revenue [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3361.48s)]
*  so [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3363.0s)]
*  Just or ar last quarter. They did 165 billion. That's 165 million. Sorry. Yeah, so they're at 650 million in arr growing [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3364.2s)]
*  56% [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3373.3799999999997s)]
*  That's amazing. So you're over year 51 year of year [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3374.7599999999998s)]
*  So, you know project that for they're probably going to be at a billion in arr next year [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3377.7999999999997s)]
*  119 percent nrr, which is very good, especially considering that it's from smb folks [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3383.22s)]
*  It's not revenue retention. It's the way to think about that is if you just look at your existing customers [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3389.48s)]
*  Going into next year. What percent of that subscription base [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3395.16s)]
*  Is going to be there? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3399.48s)]
*  And if it was 80 it would mean 20 of your customers are turning away if it's 119 percent [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3401.32s)]
*  it means you have expansion from your customer base in other words your [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3407.48s)]
*  Customers are buying more [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3411.88s)]
*  And there will be some who churn but the ones who are expanding more than make up for that and then they've been very capital efficient [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3413.56s)]
*  Apparently they've only burned 15 million today. That does not mean they've only raised 15 million. They've raised [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3419.8s)]
*  several hundred million [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3425.0800000000004s)]
*  In various growth rounds, but they've still got that money in the bank [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3426.76s)]
*  So I assume they raised it as a cushion in case they missed their forecast or something like that [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3430.04s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like a pretty strong business. But I think his point is right is that [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3435.1600000000003s)]
*  They're kind of the ceiling, you know [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3439.64s)]
*  So I think founders still have maybe unrealistic expectations from the days when [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3443.0s)]
*  SaaS businesses were being valued at 100 times arr [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3447.2400000000002s)]
*  Have you had this conversation sax with folks coming in for funding who have great businesses or let's call them good to great businesses [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3449.96s)]
*  Somewhere in that zone. There's seven eight nine businesses, but their valuations are way off [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3456.76s)]
*  And do you do you bring up? Hey, here's what your your company would be worth publicly [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3461.7200000000003s)]
*  This is what your last round is and then trying to negotiate in between those two numbers because [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3466.36s)]
*  It does seem like founders are [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3471.2400000000002s)]
*  Bringing that up proactively in some meetings with me. They're actually aware of public comps now and and they're kind of admitting [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3473.7200000000003s)]
*  Hey, I get it kind of situation. Yeah, I think founder expectations have adjusted on this [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3482.28s)]
*  Yeah, which is healthy. Yeah when you're in a hot market, there's definitely a lot of [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3486.68s)]
*  Sharing among founders of what's happening and where valuations are at and I think the same thing is probably happening in the down market as well [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3491.9599999999996s)]
*  So yeah, I think everyone's getting more realistic. Yeah, just to finish on clavio. I just want to give a shout out to toby lukey the best [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3498.7599999999998s)]
*  thing that I saw about that was that shopify actually owns like 11 percent of this company, which I think like if you look at the [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3505.0s)]
*  Corporations again just doing an incredible job of building an ecosystem [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3513.62s)]
*  Not only does toby support these companies but shopify ends up owning a huge non-trivial portion [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3517.0s)]
*  I think shopify owns like 11 or 12 percent of clavio [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3521.48s)]
*  They I think with the sale of the flex port deliver back to flex port. They own 13 or 14 percent of it [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3525.48s)]
*  I suspect they probably own a non-trivial share of stripe [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3533.08s)]
*  I say it's incredible. All right [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3536.6800000000003s)]
*  If you do with some of the parts on on shopify [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3539.08s)]
*  Their cash and cash and then cash equivalents are only valued at like two or three billion [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3541.56s)]
*  So I feel like there's a ton of upside there just for free again [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3545.56s)]
*  I don't know that i haven't done the work but i'm just saying it seems like it seems like he's great [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3547.96s)]
*  So I think that brings up a really interesting point which is the only vulnerability [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3553.7999999999997s)]
*  Or negative I think about clavio's business is the fact that 70 percent of it is on shopify [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3558.04s)]
*  So that's a platform dependency [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3564.2799999999997s)]
*  And whenever 70 percent of your business is on one platform [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3566.92s)]
*  You always have to be afraid of getting the rug pulled out from under you [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3569.5600000000004s)]
*  By the way, that was paypal's problem back in the day 20 years ago. 70 of our business was on ebay [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3572.28s)]
*  eBay had a competitor. We're constantly worried that they were going to pull the rug out from under us [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3578.1200000000003s)]
*  If we could have made a business deal with ebay, we would never have had to sell the company [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3582.92s)]
*  It would have been ideal. I think clavio was really smart [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3586.36s)]
*  Creating alignment with shopify by letting them invest giving them equity [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3589.48s)]
*  Doing a rev share agreement [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3593.96s)]
*  And they would be smart to continue that rev share agreement into the future to take this risk off the table [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3595.72s)]
*  Because investors do not like existential risk. You could have a perfect business [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3602.04s)]
*  But if there's some hard to quantify risk of the whole thing basically getting rug pulled then how do you discount that? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3605.32s)]
*  David as an investor you look at that and you're like, okay, I then price this company as a function of shopify [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3611.8s)]
*  That's a good point, I mean 70 percent of the business is shopify the way I would look at it is [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3619.08s)]
*  I would price it as a sas business because shopify is more of a transact. Well, they're a transactional slash [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3623.64s)]
*  sas business [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3628.92s)]
*  Clavio's a superior sas business. I'd price it as a sas business, but I would have to create some sort of discount for the chance [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3630.2s)]
*  that [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3637.56s)]
*  You know that the well shopify adds the features. How do you figure that out? That's a really complicated thing to figure out [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3638.52s)]
*  Yeah, I agree [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3644.92s)]
*  But I think that clavio mitigates the risks to the extent they do this like rev share agreement [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3646.04s)]
*  It's a really savvy move for people who have insights into the market to own pieces of emerging companies and lock in that partnership [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3649.72s)]
*  This was emil michael a shout out at uber and travis did this with all of the grabs dds, etc [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3657.0s)]
*  And then dara just slowly sold those positions and they were incredible cash [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3664.12s)]
*  A creative to that stock and to running that business. Let's talk about air table for a second [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3669.48s)]
*  This also trended on twitter with the tweet storm if you don't know what air table is it's kind of like what is it? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3675.16s)]
*  It's like excel meets a database and it's more programmable [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3681.64s)]
*  So if you wanted to have a bunch of users [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3685.0s)]
*  A lot of small businesses use it medium-sized businesses and they use it to let's say [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3687.88s)]
*  Instead of hiring somebody to build a database system [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3693.7200000000003s)]
*  Uh, or it's like google sheets on steroids. It's actually a really good product and it's a really sick product [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3697.08s)]
*  I've seen it used like 10 different ways. Some people use it for tracking product feature requests [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3702.2000000000003s)]
*  Uh, and you know task lists some people use it for contact database. Some people use it for complex project management [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3708.36s)]
*  It's super extensible [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3714.92s)]
*  Super easy to use and great collaborative tool [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3716.52s)]
*  Uh, you think about it like it's like a spreadsheet for words instead of numbers. Yeah [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3719.56s)]
*  Yeah, but you could also do numbers [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3723.7200000000003s)]
*  So yeah with a lot of great features that you can do really dynamic things within the spreadsheet [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3725.1600000000003s)]
*  Do you guys believe in this swiss army knife approach of building these kinds of things or do you believe that it's just cheaper and simpler? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3729.4s)]
*  To build best in class versions of each of those use cases freeburg that you just I think it allows certain businesses to have a very specific [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3736.84s)]
*  tunable [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3744.12s)]
*  Version of what they need from call it a project management tool [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3745.4s)]
*  So if you use a traditional project management tool [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3748.36s)]
*  It may be too overbuilt or it may be too specific whereas this tool allows you to build something unique for your platform [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3751.0s)]
*  So that's where i've seen a lot of teams use it instead of other tools like jira or whatever for tracking [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3757.48s)]
*  Well, this is the point. I just wonder that you get these [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3762.68s)]
*  Small non-scalable use cases because then if a company is successful [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3766.7599999999998s)]
*  Don't they then just migrate to jira? [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3771.72s)]
*  For example, no, I do it a lot like spreadsheets [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3774.12s)]
*  basically the reason people use spreadsheets for so many different things is because everyone's got their own [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3776.3599999999997s)]
*  Representation of data and utilization of a spreadsheet and I think this is just an extension of that [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3781.54s)]
*  It's a big about it is a more feature rich spreadsheet tool. I actually think that chamas question is is an excellent one [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3785.72s)]
*  I I tweeted many years ago that the way I saw [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3791.56s)]
*  Excel was the long tail of use cases that hadn't moved into a dedicated sass app yet [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3795.38s)]
*  That's interesting. Yeah, and that the way that if you wanted to be a sass founder, you're trying to come up with ideas [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3800.76s)]
*  find some really [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3806.12s)]
*  Complicated excel spreadsheet that's used across many different businesses. Yeah, and just figure out if you can move that into a sass app [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3808.18s)]
*  So for example think about karta [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3814.28s)]
*  You know before karta people just use a spreadsheet for the cap table and every company totally had a cap table spreadsheet [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3816.84s)]
*  But they just move that into specific sass app [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3823.96s)]
*  So I think there's a lot of that and so and all a spreadsheet is it's a visual representation of a database with some [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3826.36s)]
*  Relational logic that you build into the the cells of the spreadsheet and this this pattern of breaking apart breaking apart a major [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3832.02s)]
*  Product was the playbook for craigslist people looked at craigslist and said oh [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3839.1600000000003s)]
*  There's couch surfing make that airbnb. Oh, there's a ride sharing i'm going to la [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3843.08s)]
*  I have two extra seats that became like uber so people this playbook has a visual of that too where every [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3848.2s)]
*  Category on craigslist became its own like five startups. Yeah [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3854.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, you know everybody uses yeah free break everybody uses [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3860.9199999999996s)]
*  Different that's interesting that it comes to you [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3864.8399999999997s)]
*  That's the one that comes first craigslist was a huge dating product before dating apps came out [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3866.68s)]
*  It was casual encounters or missed what was it called? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3870.28s)]
*  Miss connections miss connections was hilarious to read it was like me you the number four train [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3874.36s)]
*  I think the point though with the question that I was asking is exactly this which is [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3879.6400000000003s)]
*  you have these [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3883.96s)]
*  beefed up [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3885.7200000000003s)]
*  Workflow things that happen in excel [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3887.32s)]
*  but then [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3890.36s)]
*  Eventually you go to these systems of record [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3891.48s)]
*  That are purpose-built to solve the use case and if the use case is important enough [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3895.0s)]
*  It just seems like that's what's happened [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3899.24s)]
*  I don't have a view because i've never used the product but I wonder whether part of this valuation reset doesn't reflect that dynamic [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3900.68s)]
*  It is a dynamic. Uh, the two [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3907.3199999999997s)]
*  Companies or yeah, two or three companies that represent it best is there's a product called coda [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3910.02s)]
*  Uh, which is part wiki part airtable part database and it's programmable and notion [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3915.7999999999997s)]
*  And now people are making templates in notion [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3922.04s)]
*  And then they're adding [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3925.3999999999996s)]
*  Things like project management, so I asked my team to do project management for events [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3927.48s)]
*  And they tried base camp they were looking at a sauna and then somebody was like, you know [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3932.52s)]
*  What I just added it to notion is good enough [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3937.2400000000002s)]
*  It's not as good as those other two products [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3940.04s)]
*  But it's good enough and we don't have to and the reason they didn't want to do is not because we're cheap [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3941.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't want to spend money on another sass product. We don't want to have to teach everybody a new sass product [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3945.56s)]
*  We don't have to want to do the logins for that. So I think it is a natural tension and people are doing both trimmothil [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3949.48s)]
*  Some people like the best of breed [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3956.86s)]
*  But you're also seeing it [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3958.7s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this past week slack added [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3960.14s)]
*  I think during dreamforce the ability to give you an ai summary of everything you missed and then zoom added ai summaries of calls [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3962.7799999999997s)]
*  so that feature [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3969.98s)]
*  That uh, I guess otter and some other people were doing that feature is now built into zoom [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3972.38s)]
*  You you get a transcript from zoom for free and now you get a summary of the call for free [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3976.94s)]
*  That is work that was done [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3982.62s)]
*  By somebody on the meeting right somebody was responsible for being the note taker [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3984.7s)]
*  Sometimes somebody was so those are jobs that are gone [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3988.46s)]
*  And I think it speaks to the bigger economy [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3991.5s)]
*  I had the ceo of kayak on this week in startups this week [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3993.18s)]
*  It'll come out next week [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3995.9s)]
*  He's really great and I asked him about hiring and the size of the company said i'm not hiring anybody in the next year or two [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=3997.2599999999998s)]
*  Because all my developers are 30 or 40 better. I got junior developers that are acting like senior developers [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4002.54s)]
*  I got senior developers who are turning into 10x developers. We're not hiring [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4007.42s)]
*  We're just going to have increased margin. So what happened to air table air table had a massive valuation. Uh, here's the tweet storm [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4010.94s)]
*  That's somebody from cb insights this guy anand, uh, who I think I follow him [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4019.1s)]
*  He does did something happen or nothing. Well, they're most recently valued at 11.7 billion in december. They're 2021 series f [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4023.18s)]
*  His thesis not only is air table worth less than 11.7 billion. It's likely worse [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4030.3s)]
*  Less than the 1.4 billion in funding it has raised to free bergs from bringing this point up [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4035.3399999999997s)]
*  Over and over about the overfunding and cash in is less than the valuation [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4041.3399999999997s)]
*  Most yeah, most of these unicorns are worth less than their total press tech and this is a good example [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4044.62s)]
*  I've just been through this this week. I went I saw it as a company. I was an investor in that. I saw this happen [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4049.74s)]
*  Air table on track to do their big problem is I mean they're doing over 100 million of arr [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4054.8599999999997s)]
*  It's a it's a great product and 150 million of arr that's no small feat [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4059.98s)]
*  The problem is the growth rate. I think it's only 15 percent [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4065.5800000000004s)]
*  What do you do with the founder's sacks because this was my point earlier is in these circumstances. It's still a good business [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4068.06s)]
*  Investors are going to want to own these shares at some price [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4073.96s)]
*  Someone will buy new shares at some price [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4076.86s)]
*  But to do this transaction given that the preference in the company which is effectively debt is greater than the value of the company [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4078.86s)]
*  The founders and the employees get their ownership stakes wiped out [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4085.26s)]
*  So if you want to keep the employee, you know [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4088.54s)]
*  I think their only hope is to go public because that wipes out the pref stack and everyone basically just owns their percentage of the company [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4090.8599999999997s)]
*  If they don't go public [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4096.62s)]
*  And if the founder private investor do that, why would a preferred investor allow that to happen? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4098.38s)]
*  Well, this is going to be the huge tension on the board is that if you're a common holder or if you're one of the [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4102.7s)]
*  Early investors of the company you want to go public if you're a late stage investor [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4107.74s)]
*  You don't want to give up your preference [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4111.42s)]
*  But those late stage people sacks did not have blocker rights in many cases because the market market was so hot [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4113.26s)]
*  They just put the money in without a block. Yeah, I mean unless they had a ratchet into the ipo, but yeah [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4119.26s)]
*  Yeah, but in many cases, but that's not a universal truth, right? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4123.900000000001s)]
*  In almost in the majority of these cases the preferred shareholders do have significant representation on the board [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4127.1s)]
*  They do have the ability to influence whether or not the company is going to go public and there's likely some middle ground [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4133.820000000001s)]
*  That every company ends up having to meet at [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4138.22s)]
*  Which is we're going to recap the company in a way that we're going to give some shares [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4140.38s)]
*  newly issued shares to founders what we saw with door dash [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4143.9800000000005s)]
*  Door dash they got dragged along. Yeah in door dash. I think they all just got dragged out [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4147.42s)]
*  They didn't have a choice the my understanding of some of these late rounds during peak zurp [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4151.9800000000005s)]
*  2020 [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4156.76s)]
*  2021 from talking to bill girly was people did not negotiate those rights those rights the blocker rights weren't available [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4157.820000000001s)]
*  And if the majority of common says we're going public you're going public [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4163.5s)]
*  And that's the that's the end of the story here's here's the punchline to the air table if you look at the uh, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4166.78s)]
*  ford [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4172.14s)]
*  price to sales multiple 78x for an 11.7 billion dollar valuation at 150 million arr [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4173.02s)]
*  And you compare it to the trailing [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4179.58s)]
*  price to sales multiples [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4181.9800000000005s)]
*  In the project management space monday's at 12x plus asana 6.6x and smart sheets at just around 8x [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4184.46s)]
*  So it's a challenge. Yeah [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4191.74s)]
*  Well to freeberg's point [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4193.34s)]
*  One of the downsides of taking all this excessive capital at these ridiculous valuations is that it produces a dynamic in your boardroom [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4195.34s)]
*  Where your board members are at war with each other? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4203.900000000001s)]
*  The late stage investors are going to be at war with the early stage investors and the founders [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4206.62s)]
*  And who knows who comes out on top of that thing, but that's not a healthy dynamic [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4210.860000000001s)]
*  I don't know if you guys have but i've got like so many anecdotes over the last couple of months on this exact [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4214.22s)]
*  Scenario playing out. We'll take us through an amalgamation of those [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4219.02s)]
*  You know without talking about specific ones, but you know, you can make an amalgamation [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4223.34s)]
*  What is the dynamic and how does it work itself out investor invested a multi-billion dollar valuation? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4226.860000000001s)]
*  The company is now worth 20 of that valuation [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4232.22s)]
*  And the investors have more money in the company than it is worth [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4235.82s)]
*  And the company needs more cash. They can't go public at this rate because the markets are shut down [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4239.5s)]
*  No one's going to buy new shares. They can't raise cash by going public [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4244.54s)]
*  So they have to raise cash in the private markets. So then the tough question is okay [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4247.66s)]
*  What's the value of the company in almost all of these cases the ceo has been replaced? [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4251.9s)]
*  Or there with some professional ceo [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4257.5s)]
*  So there's a new option pool created equal to 10 to 15 of the company new options are issued [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4259.82s)]
*  And around is done at a significant discount under the huge recap and a pay to play [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4265.0199999999995s)]
*  And all this other sort of stuff starts to play out that the original founders in the company get wiped out [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4269.58s)]
*  most of the management team leaves because their options are now worthless and the investors who [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4274.219999999999s)]
*  Historically have been totally passive late stage investors [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4279.34s)]
*  Have had to step in and try and take action in rebuilding a management team, which guess what they're not necessarily good at [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4282.620000000001s)]
*  And so it ends up becoming this really nasty unwinding of the business because everyone thinks oh well [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4287.900000000001s)]
*  I deserve to get a fair deal because I put money in and I have a preference in this company [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4292.9400000000005s)]
*  Founders don't want to see their ownership go down from 20 to 2. They're like, why would I keep working for 2? I'm fully vested [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4297.42s)]
*  I'm going to leave the management team's like wait a second [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4304.3s)]
*  I'm getting offers left and right to go join other companies [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4306.3s)]
*  And so it's a real kind of nasty unwinding and I think that's the scary scenario [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4308.46s)]
*  That's likely going to play out at not all but a good chunk of these companies that are there are still businesses [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4312.46s)]
*  They have decent value to their business [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4317.66s)]
*  But they just raise too much capital relative to the valuation of the business today [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4319.58s)]
*  If you looked at it on a blank piece of paper, these businesses will look incredible at whatever the true [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4322.9400000000005s)]
*  valuation is today [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4328.68s)]
*  But if you have the psychological hindsight bias of what the price was two years ago [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4330.62s)]
*  You just can't see that truth. Totally can't get it by the way. I will say there's structure [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4336.46s)]
*  There's like legacy structure in the cap table from [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4340.78s)]
*  Yeah, meaning there's like this pref stack. I will say that the terms are so crazy good for the recap [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4344.9400000000005s)]
*  That investors are clawing their way into the recap round. Well, that means nature markets are healing [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4351.5s)]
*  That's means we're in the end game, right? Yeah, that's part of what's happening part of what's happening is it's totally predatory [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4357.820000000001s)]
*  It's totally predatory [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4364.3s)]
*  What i've seen is when when you have to go public again [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4366.62s)]
*  I think that when there's a recap and the founder is still running the company [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4369.900000000001s)]
*  There's a chance of it being fair, but when they bring in a new ceo who then does a recap. Oh, yeah [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4374.06s)]
*  No, they don't care. They don't care. They don't care about their investors. They care about their interest [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4379.42s)]
*  Exactly, and all these recaps turn into a disaster. Yeah. Well, it's recap or you're going to go out of business [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4383.5s)]
*  So, I mean this is a force and function and everybody party too hard. I think it's time [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4390.22s)]
*  for [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4395.58s)]
*  Everybody's favorite part of the show [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4396.38s)]
*  Which is to give [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4399.1s)]
*  Chamath his flowers. Here we go [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4401.5s)]
*  Chamath the fed spoke this week [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4405.26s)]
*  and [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4409.34s)]
*  It's time [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4410.9400000000005s)]
*  For chamath to take his victory lap here he goes everybody [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4414.22s)]
*  Chamath is this polyhomage? This is vangelis. Yes vangelis doing chariots of fire this week [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4420.860000000001s)]
*  the fed said [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4428.14s)]
*  To quote chamath [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4430.38s)]
*  Well, this look i paid him [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4433.1s)]
*  This is this is but interest rates would stay higher to the deep state for longer. There he is [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4435.1s)]
*  There's chamath leading the pack. I sent my I sent my talking points from six months ago [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4440.46s)]
*  To my deeps to our friend deep state [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4445.5s)]
*  I sent the note and deep state sent it to the fed and the fed just cut and pasted it into the [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4447.42s)]
*  Rates will stay higher for longer [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4455.58s)]
*  I don't think anyone understands what it is that chamath said that he's taking the victory lap on once you set that up jake [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4462.46s)]
*  That rates will stay higher for longer [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4466.86s)]
*  And now he takes his victory lap. All right enough of this shenanigans [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4471.18s)]
*  Chamath said rates will stay higher for longer. The fed said rates will stay higher for longer at the end. Congratulations chamath. You got it, right? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4476.3s)]
*  Thanks. Okay. Well, let's actually talk about give our chariots of fire. Oh [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4483.42s)]
*  Here he is [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4490.22s)]
*  This is when obama who is obama giving the medal to what's the real picture here it's obama [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4496.38s)]
*  Is he giving it to my metal to obama to biden? [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4501.42s)]
*  But I think he's [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4503.9s)]
*  So I think what happened this week is actually pretty important because [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4511.26s)]
*  I think the markets were really trying to force jerome powell to start the cutting cycle [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4516.7s)]
*  And now they had to move [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4523.5s)]
*  The date at which they could expect cuts out [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4525.9s)]
*  by a year [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4529.58s)]
*  And I think that we're only starting to see the reverberations of that you're going to have to reprice [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4531.82s)]
*  a lot of risk assets, so [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4538.139999999999s)]
*  If you put it all together [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4541.5s)]
*  Oil is creeping back up. So commodity prices essentially are trending up [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4544.299999999999s)]
*  I don't think that's going to have a big impact on inflation because of the way that [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4551.66s)]
*  That owner equivalent rents and core cpi is calculated because it's calculated on this six-month lag this [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4555.18s)]
*  dumb nonsense of just how arcane our system works, but [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4562.860000000001s)]
*  That's going to spike down. So [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4566.780000000001s)]
*  Basically the fed's like saying we know all of this is happening. We're sitting on our hands [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4568.9400000000005s)]
*  But the problem is that if you add another [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4573.02s)]
*  100 basis points to your discount rate [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4576.62s)]
*  For an unprofitable sas company [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4579.66s)]
*  My gosh guys, you're taking like another [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4582.3s)]
*  Turn and a half of market cap out of the business like if you thought it was worth eight times [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4585.740000000001s)]
*  It's now worth six and a half six times [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4590.54s)]
*  So unfortunately, that's going to hurt everything that's not the top seven tech companies [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4595.02s)]
*  And everything else is just going to [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4603.9800000000005s)]
*  Just kind of meander along for a much longer time. So it's really good for the magnificent seven [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4605.9800000000005s)]
*  I think it's really bad for everything else [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4612.780000000001s)]
*  And we're going to be in a holding pattern for a while crude oil [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4615.820000000001s)]
*  Is at uh, let's see [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4620.780000000001s)]
*  89 dollars a barrel. Yeah, it's it's getting back up there. I told remember remember this conversation [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4623.58s)]
*  I told my ceos guys, let's get enough cash to last through the middle of 25 [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4628.38s)]
*  Sure. Remember I was pretty clear about that to folks. I mean get to get to [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4633.740000000001s)]
*  Default alive, but if you can't please have enough money to the mid of 25. I think that that was wrong [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4638.38s)]
*  I think now you got to be q1 of 26 [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4644.54s)]
*  And maybe even mid 26. So now I have to go back to all these ceos and redo [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4648.7s)]
*  An entire justification for why they need to cut even more people [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4655.259999999999s)]
*  Cut even more expense cut more burn [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4659.259999999999s)]
*  I don't know where we're going to find another year of burn in most of these businesses [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4662.379999999999s)]
*  So I was wrong by at least a year jason because of this. I think I got the words right but I got the timing [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4667.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just to further translate this. Okay, so the markets right now are definitely taking a bath [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4672.78s)]
*  The growth stocks are off significantly expect them to be off more [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4678.86s)]
*  Yeah [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4682.62s)]
*  And the reason is because the market had started to price in rate cuts next year and now the fed is saying that because inflation [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4682.86s)]
*  Ticked up a little bit. It's not coming down as much. We have higher energy prices [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4689.74s)]
*  We may not get those rate cuts [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4695.02s)]
*  I think the fed still maintains that we'll get 50 basis points of rate cuts next year [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4696.54s)]
*  But the mark was pricing in more and I think people are starting to wonder if we'll even get the 50 [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4701.26s)]
*  So as a result of that interest rates are going to stay higher longer [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4706.780000000001s)]
*  Which means that risk capital will be less available [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4710.46s)]
*  So valuations are going to go down or at least they're not going to be racing back up like they used to when I was saying mid 25 [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4713.42s)]
*  Sax that was because the forward curves started showing cuts in early 23 [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4720.860000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? So I was like, okay, let's assume they're wrong by 18 months [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4726.46s)]
*  It turns out that that initial data point in early 22 [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4730.219999999999s)]
*  My god, we were wrong by three years [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4733.74s)]
*  Not a year and a half, right? It's brutal [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4737.9s)]
*  And I think the x factor here is that we're running almost two trillion dollar deficits [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4740.139999999999s)]
*  In peacetime. Well, I mean we're not in a direct war. We're in a proxy war but in relative peacetime [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4746.46s)]
*  and in a relatively decent economy [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4751.82s)]
*  so [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4755.58s)]
*  What happens? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4756.78s)]
*  If either of those things change and [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4758.3s)]
*  What happens to long-term rates as all of these? [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4761.5s)]
*  Debt issuances you have to get raised as the fed has to keep selling more treasuries to fund our deficit and debt [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4764.860000000001s)]
*  At these higher rates do long-term rates keep going up based on the debt financing needs of the federal government [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4771.66s)]
*  and then this is again where [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4777.02s)]
*  you know, we made a huge mistake by politicizing this idea of [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4778.780000000001s)]
*  Raising money beyond 30 years. We made that mistake under the trump presidency because people reacted to trump saying it but it was [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4783.5s)]
*  the smartest thing we could have done to give our kids and our grandkids a reasonable economy [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4791.34s)]
*  And freeburg has been right all along about just like our spending is just going up and up and up and now short-term rates are [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4798.0599999999995s)]
*  Really high [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4805.34s)]
*  maybe we'll have enough political will to just [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4806.94s)]
*  Get out of the fed's way and the fed can actually look at raising in durations past 30 years [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4810.46s)]
*  Because if you believe that we're going to start an aggressive cutting cycle at some point [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4816.78s)]
*  And you believe we'll get back to like a two percent terminal rate. You could theoretically justify 50 60 year bonds [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4821.82s)]
*  At at much lower than the 30 year, but I don't see it happening. Here's a really good way to [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4829.179999999999s)]
*  Look at this there are prediction markets this one kal she is the one I use kalshi [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4835.9800000000005s)]
*  Chances of a rate cut by may of 20 24 [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4841.5s)]
*  29 chance and these are people actually making bets on these things and so it has gotten pushed out and I guess [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4846.68s)]
*  74 chance [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4854.360000000001s)]
*  By the fourth quarter third fourth quarter of next year people think there'll be a rate cut [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4856.3s)]
*  So we're a year away from a rate cut everybody needs to just take that off the table, which means [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4860.22s)]
*  The translation for founders for gps [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4865.660000000001s)]
*  Is performance has to go up you got to beat [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4868.9400000000005s)]
*  Five six seven percent or whatever people are going to get on those other instruments [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4872.62s)]
*  Corporate debt, you know 10 11 12 percent [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4877.58s)]
*  You got a really hard bogey to beat here. The alternative to that statement is that total capital has to go down [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4879.740000000001s)]
*  in order for the capital remaining [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4886.06s)]
*  To have its return multiple increased given that there's a generally [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4889.02s)]
*  Set number of companies that are going to generally create a certain amount of value over the next couple of years [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4895.18s)]
*  And the way to create that value is so if that's true [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4900.14s)]
*  Well, i'm saying if there's a bunch of startups that are going to make 100 billion dollars of market value over the next five to seven [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4903.02s)]
*  years [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4907.66s)]
*  You need to have less capital going into those companies in order for that capital to generate a higher return [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4908.78s)]
*  Which on your day-to-day basis means what free bird explain on a day-to-day basis on a day-to-day [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4913.42s)]
*  Basis it means there's gonna be less companies that are gonna get funded [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4918.46s)]
*  But more importantly is gonna be less lp money going into venture [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4920.46s)]
*  And there's gonna be less capital available to fund startups in aggregate [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4923.58s)]
*  By a significant amount on a daily basis. You need to do more with less as a founder [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4927.42s)]
*  You need to delight customers with less resources spend less money on marketing send less money on teams and get to profitability [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4932.78s)]
*  You've got to be a stronger founder. I'm seeing it across the board in the seed stage two three four founders [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4938.860000000001s)]
*  Raising 250 to a million instead of raising three to five. I gotta be honest. I thought it was much easier [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4945.419999999999s)]
*  To kind of say the sky was falling [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4953.179999999999s)]
*  this time last year [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4956.139999999999s)]
*  Sure right now [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4958.219999999999s)]
*  And I think that people are a little bit again exhausted about hearing this message constantly of like cup more. It's like [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4959.74s)]
*  I think that they're exhausted [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4966.0599999999995s)]
*  And I see a lot of founders that are exhausted and giving up. There's a lot of giving up [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4968.299999999999s)]
*  They're like they're like I I can't cut anymore and now I do think we have to go back to them and say [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4973.5s)]
*  If we're doing our jobs, right? [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4979.34s)]
*  Okay, even okay. Look our now [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4981.5s)]
*  our strategic [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4984.22s)]
*  View was right [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4986.22s)]
*  But the time scale of our analysis was wrong [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4987.74s)]
*  And I think now you got a plan to mid 26 [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4991.42s)]
*  I don't even know where to start to be honest with that conversation [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4994.14s)]
*  Actually that what i'm seeing is people are merging companies and mna is picking up because hey [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=4997.42s)]
*  You got two companies doing five million each, but they're burning two million each a year [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5002.06s)]
*  Cut half the team put one team with the other and I think you're going to just see some of that [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5007.34s)]
*  Portfolio consolidation happen. Go ahead sex. I think one way to put it is [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5011.740000000001s)]
*  That we've had a regime change. Those are the words that we've been using for a while and specifically [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5016.22s)]
*  We've gone from a regime of capital abundance to a regime of capital scarcity [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5021.26s)]
*  And I think a lot of people are holding out hope that there's gonna be a quick bounce back [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5026.3s)]
*  Because we've cut these interest rates and capital would start flowing again in a big way [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5030.3s)]
*  And I think that the fed here has dumped a bucket of cold water [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5035.42s)]
*  On the markets basically saying we're not bouncing back to capital [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5040.22s)]
*  Abundance anytime soon. We're going to be in this [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5043.72s)]
*  environment of more capital scarcity and that's what I think this founders and vcs now have to take into account is [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5046.76s)]
*  This shift could be permanent or it could it could last a while could last five ten years. Sure [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5053.1s)]
*  We're seeing a lot of question I have is just what do you guys think is going to happen to the consumer because I [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5058.46s)]
*  Actually think that [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5062.86s)]
*  Even though founders in many cases could cut more and they could have acted faster [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5064.139999999999s)]
*  I actually think that the b2b economy has kind of taken its licks. I mean for the last year we've been in this [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5067.58s)]
*  software recession [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5074.62s)]
*  Companies have been sharpening their pencils. They've been cutting costs and getting more efficient [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5076.139999999999s)]
*  Yes, you could say maybe they haven't done enough but the consumer has still been strong [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5080.38s)]
*  But what is the consumer going to do now that credit card rates and interest payments are at all-time highs [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5084.219999999999s)]
*  They're going to they can't sell their house. No, here's what they're going to do [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5089.66s)]
*  They're going to skip an iphone cycle instead of going from [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5092.7s)]
*  You know 13 to 14 or 14 to 15. They're going to go 13 to 16 14 to 17 [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5096.299999999999s)]
*  They'll just skip which which I did for the first time [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5100.86s)]
*  I don't need to skip it, but I was just like, ah this 13 is good enough. They're going to skip upgrading their car [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5104.0599999999995s)]
*  You're going to keep your car for an extra two or three years [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5109.34s)]
*  And if you were thinking about moving your house, you're going to say you know what i'm going to make this house work [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5111.82s)]
*  We're going to put two of the kids in a room 100 right? I think that is that is I think that's very [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5116.3s)]
*  I think that's very well said and and the other side of it is that [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5121.74s)]
*  Some of these industries where you have these large ticket purchases that drive consumer consumption [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5125.66s)]
*  Their backs are against the wall. Look at the automakers that the deals that's that the unions have proposed to the automakers [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5131.34s)]
*  Will cause them from I thought I saw an out and an analysis of ford [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5138.3s)]
*  Where ford would go [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5143.179999999999s)]
*  If you just did a pro forma and went back the last couple years they would have gone from like [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5144.86s)]
*  You know 30 billion of profits to minus 17 billion of losses. So that's a 47 billion swing in the ford pnl [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5148.94s)]
*  The only way they overcome that is with more expensive cars [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5156.54s)]
*  Which jason to your point means that those cars are not going to get sold [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5159.26s)]
*  I do think that you're going to just have a little bit of belt tightening in the in the consumer [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5162.62s)]
*  I think this is interesting. I think you know tremoth you're right that at the same time that the auto companies are facing [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5167.34s)]
*  What you'd expect to be reduced demand because no one can afford a car payment at these higher interest rates [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5173.9800000000005s)]
*  The unions are going on strike demanding. Oh, I think this is existential higher wages [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5178.860000000001s)]
*  Yeah for a four-day work week. How does this work a work week? I think that the the labor deal is an existential risk [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5184.780000000001s)]
*  To the unionized auto industry in america and i'm not opining on whether [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5192.54s)]
*  This deal should or should not happen. I'm just making an observation if the deal as announced happens [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5196.780000000001s)]
*  and you [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5203.42s)]
*  sensitize [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5204.84s)]
*  Stellantis gm and ford's pnl to these new terms [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5206.6s)]
*  And then you compare that against [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5211.26s)]
*  non-unionized highly automated organizations like tesla and rivian [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5213.72s)]
*  It's going to be very difficult for the established auto industry to survive, right? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5218.9400000000005s)]
*  And then if you'd layer on top of it [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5223.1s)]
*  Seven eight nine percent consumer lending rates for new cars forget about it and yet the fed [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5225.660000000001s)]
*  Forecast at the same meaning they were being hawkish about rates. They also said that they were expecting [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5232.200000000001s)]
*  Unemployment next year to be 4.1 percent down from their previous expectation of 4.5 percent [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5238.280000000001s)]
*  And they forecast that economic growth would be higher. So I just don't understand how these countervailing forces [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5243.58s)]
*  Aren't going to create so much stress in the economy that something breaks [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5249.58s)]
*  And these [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5253.58s)]
*  uh [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5254.54s)]
*  Idiot unions, honestly, their timing is so dumb whether it's the ones, you know in hollywood or this car strike while they're [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5255.419999999999s)]
*  Shutting down. It's great for tesla. I mean it's giving tesla the entire u.s. Auto market. Yeah [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5263.259999999999s)]
*  Tesla is lowering the price when I bought my model y long range. I think I paid 72 for it [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5268.219999999999s)]
*  The old price on this chart says 66 [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5274.7s)]
*  That car is now 53 [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5277.66s)]
*  That's down 20 a 13 000 saves the model y long range I think is the greatest [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5280.22s)]
*  Vehicle ever made I paid 57. I think for my model y long range [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5285.9s)]
*  Oh, no. No, I think sorry. I paid 57. I paid this price for the model y performance [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5291.26s)]
*  The best car and yeah, that'll be a 40 000 car in the next three years [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5296.54s)]
*  Well, you know when I looked at it and I speaking of austerity measures, I was like [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5300.62s)]
*  I have a model x do I get another model x? [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5305.42s)]
*  I think i'll just go with the model y because the model x is I don't know 50% more and I I just prefer the model [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5307.58s)]
*  I think I think this labor deal is going to put tremendous pressure on these established auto ovms [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5312.7s)]
*  China is now the world's largest exporter from what I understand that just happened [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5318.3s)]
*  They work I looked it up 58 to 64 hours a week factory workers [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5322.7s)]
*  The u.s. Factory workers want to work 32 hours a week. They want a four-day work week [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5327.5s)]
*  I mean, I don't understand the timing of these unions [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5333.02s)]
*  I mean they they're just going to move these factories to mexico or [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5335.5s)]
*  I think it's reasonable for the unions to ask for as much as possible on behalf of their members [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5339.1s)]
*  that's like [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5344.46s)]
*  Obvious and good because meaning if you're collecting fees from those folks and you're doing a good job on their behalf [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5345.9800000000005s)]
*  Your job is to ask for as much as possible. I get that [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5351.66s)]
*  Where I see the breakdown is that it just doesn't seem like there's enough numeracy between them [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5356.14s)]
*  and the companies that they're negotiating against to really sit down and look at what the impact of this is because [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5362.06s)]
*  You may get a short-term labor deal [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5367.9800000000005s)]
*  That you can celebrate [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5370.9400000000005s)]
*  But it may actually destroy that union member's pension. Yes [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5372.7s)]
*  It may destroy the company and this is my concern is that then that has to get bailed out by by the u.s [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5376.46s)]
*  Taxpayer and once it happens in one industry. It's going to be very difficult to actually not do it in other industries and [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5381.74s)]
*  The thing that needs to be understood is the risk that it puts on those kinds of tail outcomes [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5389.82s)]
*  And I think that that's not well [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5394.7s)]
*  discussed nobody in the media is really talking about it they make it a [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5397.099999999999s)]
*  A moral issue of like what is the ceo pay? [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5401.42s)]
*  Versus what is the ratio of the multiple? Yeah, and yeah, sure [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5404.94s)]
*  Look, that's an important issue at some level [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5408.219999999999s)]
*  But if you if for example like you have u.s [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5410.54s)]
*  Senators blathering on about how they'll wear a suit and not look like a homeless bum [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5413.0199999999995s)]
*  If this deal happens in that and it's like well, that's not what you should be saying [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5417.740000000001s)]
*  What you should be saying is my team has done a financial analysis and here's what it shows [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5420.780000000001s)]
*  Right, they're not saying that this is crazy [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5427.740000000001s)]
*  What you're saying is that the negotiation and also the political dimension of this have become completely untethered from economic realities [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5429.900000000001s)]
*  Yes, they are negotiating in the review. Mura [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5438.860000000001s)]
*  They basically talked about whatever billions of dollars in profits the companies previously had during the serp environment during the heyday [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5441.66s)]
*  And yeah, it's just timing's off just add it to the list of latent problems in this economy [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5448.62s)]
*  it just feels to me like something is about to break but [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5453.66s)]
*  Who knows? I mean if the future points actually you keep bringing up like what happens with the consumer [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5456.7s)]
*  I think they just slow their role, you know staycation [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5462.3s)]
*  Instead of european vacation what larry summer said at the summit? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5465.74s)]
*  He said that soft landings are like second marriages the triumph of hope over experience [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5469.74s)]
*  Yes, meaning everyone's talking about a soft landing. Everyone's banking on a soft landing, but soft landings are actually exceedingly rare [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5475.9800000000005s)]
*  When you have very fast rate tightening cycles [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5483.26s)]
*  It generally has a very predictable effect on the economy. There's a lag, but the effect is very predictable, which is it causes recessions? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5487.02s)]
*  And then I would argue we've already been in a b2b recession [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5493.900000000001s)]
*  We're starting to come out of that [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5496.46s)]
*  But I think the consumer has been hit yet and maybe that has to do with all the stimulus they pushed through [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5498.22s)]
*  Yeah, and that created some amount of [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5503.74s)]
*  Cushion for the consumer, but I just wonder if that cushions run out now [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5507.34s)]
*  We're about to enter a new phase and what all of these [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5512.38s)]
*  Strikes you if you overplay your handsham off is automation [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5516.38s)]
*  So this happened in new york just over 10 years ago. The fast food workers wanted, you know [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5519.9800000000005s)]
*  I think it was 15 20 bucks an hour. Okay seems reasonable and they replaced every cashier [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5525.0199999999995s)]
*  You go to mcdonald's now you're ordering on the app or you're ordering [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5529.66s)]
*  on a kiosk in the space and [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5533.82s)]
*  We have an investment in a company called hello meter [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5536.379999999999s)]
*  What this company does is pretty simple. They just study what's going on inside fast restaurants [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5540.299999999999s)]
*  and then they just increase [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5545.58s)]
*  The speed at which people are getting served and they're crushing it. Why? [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5547.9s)]
*  People can't hire people there's not enough immigrants in the country anymore. We have an anti-immigration thing going on here [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5552.78s)]
*  So unemployment's too low and the the the salaries are too high [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5558.86s)]
*  It's not working a lot of restaurants are breaking because a 30 or 40 dishwasher is the difference between a company, you know [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5562.94s)]
*  A restaurant being profitable or not. All right. Listen, there's apparently some potential major breakthrough in autoimmune disease [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5569.5s)]
*  Treatment with this new inverse vaccine [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5576.679999999999s)]
*  Let's go to our science correspondent the sultan of science himself for science corner [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5580.14s)]
*  The tax is turns his camera off [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5587.26s)]
*  Wow [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5592.7s)]
*  I'm here i'm here. Geez, you wouldn't even let me get away with that [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5596.86s)]
*  Nope, we were zoom shaming you do not leave [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5600.14s)]
*  You could learn something sacks [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5605.82s)]
*  Freyberg I just want to give you a shout out my super gut. I just have my super gut chocolate. Oh so good [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5609.82s)]
*  I just got my super gut protein and uh, the weight loss continues health boosting [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5615.1s)]
*  My my gut is so good [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5620.78s)]
*  There was a paper published in the journal nature this week, which I thought was worth highlighting sacks. You're going to be quizzed afterwards on [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5623.0199999999995s)]
*  Exactly what I say during this this and the implications for it [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5630.78s)]
*  We've all heard of and know folks that have autoimmune conditions and some of us may suffer from them [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5634.0599999999995s)]
*  An autoimmune condition is when our immune system mounts an attack against a protein that exists in our body [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5639.58s)]
*  That is natively part of our body our immune system kind of mistakes that protein for being a foreign antigen [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5645.9s)]
*  So the term antigen refers to proteins that the immune system [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5651.34s)]
*  Views as invading and it needs to go in an attack [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5655.1s)]
*  So when the immune system messes up and it sees a protein in our body as being a foreign antigen and starts attacking it [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5657.1s)]
*  You get these autoimmune conditions and autoimmune conditions as you know are very debilitating [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5663.1s)]
*  Cost on the health system on people's lives the top 10 autoimmune diseases include lupus, Crohn's, rheumatoid arthritis [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5668.56s)]
*  Even type 1 diabetes multiple sclerosis irritable bowel, chogrens, Hashimoto's, thyroiditis. These are all pretty [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5675.280000000001s)]
*  in different ways damaging [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5682.96s)]
*  diseases [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5685.12s)]
*  So this team at university chicago in 2019 published a paper [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5686.240000000001s)]
*  Where they actually took an antigen [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5690.72s)]
*  And glycosylated it so basically attached some sugar molecules and carbohydrate molecules to it [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5693.68s)]
*  And presented it in the liver [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5699.360000000001s)]
*  So they put it into the blood and it showed up in the liver [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5701.04s)]
*  And they were able to cause type 1 diabetes to not develop in an animal model that was supposed to get type 1 diabetes [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5703.92s)]
*  So they did an extension of that work and the team has gotten broader and they just published this week [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5709.92s)]
*  A much more substantive paper that highlights a pretty incredible technique [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5715.04s)]
*  That may potentially address [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5720.400000000001s)]
*  A long list of autoimmune conditions. So they take the antigen the protein [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5724.0s)]
*  That is are you saying sorry in the type 1 example? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5729.84s)]
*  Are you saying like the beta cells didn't get destroyed like it just stopped it just stopped everything on the time [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5732.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5737.68s)]
*  So the immune system has a bunch of ways for self regulating there are t cells in our body called t reg cells the regulatory t cells [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5738.320000000001s)]
*  Their job is to go find the t cells and the antibodies that are attacking our own protein [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5745.76s)]
*  That's their job and when they don't do their job [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5751.2s)]
*  The antibodies and the t cells go and attack our own body. So t reg cells kind of when they're turned off. They're not doing their job [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5754.0s)]
*  so [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5761.599999999999s)]
*  It turns out that when a protein is presented in the liver in this this particular part of the liver [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5762.96s)]
*  the immune system [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5769.2s)]
*  Recognizes that protein as being a safe protein and there's a regulatory process that gets kicked off that causes the immune system [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5770.78s)]
*  To start to see that protein as being safe [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5778.3s)]
*  It should not be attacked and t reg cells start to develop and other systems start to develop that tell the whole immune system [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5780.86s)]
*  Stop attacking this protein. This is a safe protein. This is our body [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5787.66s)]
*  This is like friendly fire right like do not it's like friendly fire do not attack this protein [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5793.099999999999s)]
*  So what they did is they took several antigens proteins and glycosylated them meaning they put some you know molecules on them [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5797.580000000001s)]
*  Put them in the in the blood just with an iv hookup [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5805.1s)]
*  They go into the liver and once they're in the liver the immune system sees them and is like, whoa [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5808.06s)]
*  These are totally safe now and they found by analyzing all the different t cells the regulatory pathway that emerged [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5812.06s)]
*  That caused the body to stop attacking that protein and they were able to end ms [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5818.9400000000005s)]
*  Using this induced system in animals [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5824.06s)]
*  So basically that we have a known model for making multiple sclerosis show up in animals [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5826.06s)]
*  And they were able to stop ms in the animals by taking this particular protein that they use for ms and they put it in the in the liver [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5831.580000000001s)]
*  IV they did the same with an egg allergy and they did the same with several other antigens. This represents [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5838.620000000001s)]
*  a very novel and [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5844.860000000001s)]
*  Seemingly super impactful and powerful way to think about eliminating autoimmune disease going on in the liver [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5847.18s)]
*  Is that we can take the antigen and we now know the antigen or the protein that causes almost all of these autoimmune conditions [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5854.860000000001s)]
*  from thyroiditis to [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5861.660000000001s)]
*  Lupus to ra to ms and we can take that protein glycosylated put it in iv [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5863.5s)]
*  Ends up in our liver gets presented and our immune system realizes I shouldn't be attacking this anymore and resolves it [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5868.46s)]
*  So it opens up a whole new category of therapeutic [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5874.54s)]
*  Pathways for addressing all autoimmune conditions. It's a totally new modality [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5878.46s)]
*  It's a very interesting approach. It'll be studied more deeply folks will take this paper and try and start to develop very specific therapeutics [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5883.259999999999s)]
*  For very specific autoimmune conditions using this approach and hopefully over the next couple of years [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5891.74s)]
*  We see some of these things have success gain traction and go to market [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5896.139999999999s)]
*  These autoimmune diseases are typically some combination of genetic and environmental [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5899.5s)]
*  So this is not attacking them on that basis. It's attacking them in a different modality [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5904.3s)]
*  You know, there's two ways that we address autoimmune conditions today [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5908.94s)]
*  The first one is by presenting the antigen to the immune system before you develop autoimmunity [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5911.74s)]
*  This is like, you know when they give little bits of peanuts to kids and yeah [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5917.339999999999s)]
*  That's how you present prevent peanut allergies in most autoimmune conditions. We're past that point [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5920.299999999999s)]
*  The immune system has already developed t cells and antibodies to go on attack. So that doesn't work [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5925.0199999999995s)]
*  The second way is immune suppression and that's terrible [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5930.139999999999s)]
*  Globally suppressing meaning on the whole body turning off the immune system is not healthy in a lot of ways [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5933.02s)]
*  And that's the current, you know kind of best in class way to address autoimmune conditions [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5938.06s)]
*  So this is a new approach which is we can actually [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5941.82s)]
*  Re-regulate the immune system to not attack itself to not attack our own proteins by introducing that protein [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5945.24s)]
*  With what's called glycosylation getting it into the liver and boom this magic starts to happen [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5951.5s)]
*  And we'll see what the side effects are as they start to try this on humans we see [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5957.5s)]
*  We'll see what conditions are more effective than others. Sorry for the stupid basic question, but how is the [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5962.46s)]
*  Uh, how is it different when we put these into say like, uh, you said these were monkeys or chimpanzees [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5968.06s)]
*  So how are their anuses different than your anus? [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5972.86s)]
*  What sorry anyway, let's keep going here great science corner i'm laughing at [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5978.14s)]
*  how contorted that [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5982.94s)]
*  You you punch it up. You know, I do these workshops. I i'm just [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5985.1s)]
*  You know, let me work on we're punching it up. We'll try to get a better urine show anyway, it's super cool [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5988.9400000000005s)]
*  autoimmune conditions new world's getting better the term [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=5995.1s)]
*  Refers to an approach to a therapeutic and this modality is a new modality [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=6000.78s)]
*  So it's a super exciting new kind of universe to be explored now on how we might be able to treat autoimmune conditions ranging from [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=6004.46s)]
*  Okay, let me try hold on. Yeah, good bird. Hey, yeah, that's actually about on the science one [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=6011.74s)]
*  Free bird, what part of the body do you think is going to be most impacted by these discoveries? [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=6016.3s)]
*  no [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=6021.34s)]
*  The immune system. No, no, no, that's not good. That's not good. Okay, let me try. Let me try [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=6022.78s)]
*  You guys are just so dumb about science [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=6028.7s)]
*  Okay. All right. Here we go [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=6031.34s)]
*  Okay, here we go freeburg. I thought the only solution to ms was uh, fecal transplantation through uranus [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=6033.34s)]
*  Yeah, okay. There's your winner. There's your [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=6040.62s)]
*  Fecal transplant because the you kind of did a little uh a misdirection there with the fecal transplant and then we came back [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=6043.179999999999s)]
*  Yes, that would be a way to to get that done. We're gonna wrap here. Thanks to everybody who came [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Sb8sIi22g&t=6050.7s)]
