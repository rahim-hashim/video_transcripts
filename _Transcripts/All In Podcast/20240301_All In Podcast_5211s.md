*  and of course the chairman dictator who's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=162.7s)]
*  Becoming completely insufferable because he invested in a company seven years ago. That is absolutely crushing her in alcohol grock [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  We talked about it last week [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=171.8s)]
*  You're back. You're back. Chamath. Everybody is talking about grock. You're you're on [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=173.56s)]
*  Cloud nine, it seems crock crock crock crock crock [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=179.12s)]
*  Bitcoin Bitcoin crock crock. I [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=183.8s)]
*  mean it is [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=186.56s)]
*  interesting how your book [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=188.56s)]
*  Just literally whatever Chamath's book is that's his mood. It's just Bitcoin 60 [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=191.0s)]
*  Croc well, so the honesty level is gonna be through the roof now. Oh [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=197.76s)]
*  It's gonna be running for governor buying the Hamptons again truth bombs that your mouth is gonna drop now [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=203.64s)]
*  There is nothing like peak zirp Chamath. I mean [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=209.06s)]
*  Are we going back is are we back right now paper? What is your stake in grock already worth? Let's look we're not talking [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=213.6s)]
*  We're not we're not talking about that's so uncouth. It's so uncouth, but he's buying the Hamptons and he's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=219.88s)]
*  Been uncouth on this podcast to talk about [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=227.32s)]
*  Our wins or assets [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=231.04s)]
*  These are not it's not a win. We have never count you never count your chickens before they hatch. That's absolutely right [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  I am NOT counting any chickens. Don't book the win. Yes. There's a lot of hard work to do [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=239.23999999999998s)]
*  There's a lot more people to sell products to to build products by the way developers by the way on grock just this past week [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=244.56s)]
*  in the queue [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  the waitlist [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=255.4s)]
*  Tripled now there's almost 10,000 developers. That's a big deal. Well, that's crazy. That's a great sign [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=257.0s)]
*  I think the most important Northstar metric for these developer platforms is basically that as goes the developers so goes the platform [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=263.4s)]
*  You can kind of count on some amount of pull through because some of those developers just statistically will land really important products [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=271.04s)]
*  They'll consume more api's they'll just consume more stuff [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=277.52s)]
*  It's just all goodness because if you have nine thousand or ten thousand people just again waiting in line [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=281.04s)]
*  Once those guys get in somebody's gonna create something magical [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=287.68s)]
*  That's the great part of having a platform [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=292.64s)]
*  It's a people just take it and they build on it while you're sleeping [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=294.64s)]
*  Something amazing can just get built and you get some amount of the credit for that [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=298.6s)]
*  Nothing that's really interesting is the number of developers is increasing [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=304.48s)]
*  I've seen two or three founders recently just the last couple of weeks [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=307.44s)]
*  Who were previously idea founders who are now have taught themselves to code? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=310.96s)]
*  So, you know this there's 1% of the [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=315.4s)]
*  Whatever number of millions of developers in the world. I think it's gonna like double or triple [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=318.32s)]
*  So the the pool of people who are writing code, I think it's about to [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  Grow very meaningfully. I mean you guys you guys saw the release from the White House with your life [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=325.68s)]
*  We don't you know code it see it C++ anymore [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=330.28s)]
*  Yeah, that was very interesting [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=335.0s)]
*  I mean they were talking about memory leaks and like this is I guess the source of most memory leaks [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=336.4s)]
*  Therefore White House wants you to learn to develop in memory safe languages. Oh great [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  Awesome. Yeah, so why are they involving themselves like they got nothing better to do? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=345.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean they have an opinion on you know, preventing security leads. All right [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=350.28s)]
*  Listen the top issue this week is the same issue as last week Google's Gemini [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=355.24s)]
*  Dei black eye continues we covered this woke AI disaster last week [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=360.15999999999997s)]
*  It's kind of funny. I was watching CNBC and they had a hard time describing the problem [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=366.03999999999996s)]
*  The woman just I guess didn't want to call it what it is [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=371.18s)]
*  It's a racist AI you type in text and it gives you the opposite or just culturally insane [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=374.03999999999996s)]
*  responses, so if you put in you want a picture of George Washington from Google's Gemini or Sergey Brann you might get back like a [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=382.02s)]
*  Benetton style diversity and with like George Washington being black or Sergey [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=387.98s)]
*  Brann being Asian etc [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=392.58s)]
*  And so this has caused [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=395.06s)]
*  a bit of a kerfluffle here in the industry to say the least the stock is down 5% since we talked about it last week and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=397.38s)]
*  Sundar sent a memo to the Gemini team [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=404.9s)]
*  Of course when they write these memos to a team [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=407.24s)]
*  It's written to the entire world because you know, it's gonna get leaked and so you're writing as such [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=409.46s)]
*  It might as well be a press release [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=413.82s)]
*  I'll give two quick quotes here and then I'll throw it to the besties because there's so many questions that we have to address [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=414.82s)]
*  Quote number one, I know that some of its responses referring to Gemini have offended our users and shown bias [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=420.42s)]
*  To be clear that's completely unacceptable and we got it wrong and to be clear it wouldn't show white people [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=427.3s)]
*  especially ones like George Washington or just somebody who is obviously a [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=433.02s)]
*  Caucasian and so [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=437.82s)]
*  The next quote will be driving a clear set of actions including structural changes to me structural changes means we're gonna lay off a [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=439.74s)]
*  Bunch of people and we're gonna get rid of the DEI group. That's that's a new map [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=447.9s)]
*  That's a newfound motivational riff quote in my mind free bird will Sundar survive [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=451.65999999999997s)]
*  and [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=458.38s)]
*  Is Google too broken to fix I'm just gonna ask you since you work there [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=459.9s)]
*  I don't mean to make it uncomfortable [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=463.65999999999997s)]
*  But what are the chances Sundar survives this and what are the chances that Google can be fixed and produce great products? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=465.26s)]
*  Quickly that delight users [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=474.58s)]
*  I don't know how to answer the Sundar will survive because it's kind of an idiosyncratic organization. There are a [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=477.42s)]
*  couple of founders who have super voting shares and [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=485.9s)]
*  Ultimately comes down to their decision and the direction they want to take the company and I have no [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=490.65999999999997s)]
*  insights into what they individually think so [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=496.58s)]
*  Frankly [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=501.64s)]
*  I've spoken to a lot of folks who are investors in Google over the last week and a lot of folks are just deeply frustrated [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=502.91999999999996s)]
*  and angry [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=508.68s)]
*  On a number of fronts the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=511.56s)]
*  Business [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=515.52s)]
*  Really, there's you know three businesses inside of Google. There's you know search and ads [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=517.16s)]
*  There's YouTube and there's cloud and the rest of it is kind of noise [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=521.48s)]
*  And to give you a sense of how big these businesses are right YouTube did 10 billion a quarter roughly cloud did 10 billion a quarter [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=524.92s)]
*  they have this devices business and subscriptions business does about 10 billion a quarter and [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=531.04s)]
*  Then search does about 50 billion a quarter and the margin on search is much higher than any of those other businesses [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=536.04s)]
*  and so the search margin the ad revenue on search is [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=541.0s)]
*  You know probably a hundred percent of the true operating profit of the business [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=546.1999999999999s)]
*  So the real threat to Google is more are they in a position to maintain their search monopoly or maintain? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=550.1999999999999s)]
*  The chunk of profits that drive the business [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=558.88s)]
*  under the threat of AI are they adapting and [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=562.16s)]
*  Less so about the anger around woke and DEI because most of the investors I spoke with aren't angry about the woke DEI search engine [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=564.9599999999999s)]
*  They're angry about the fact that such a blunder happened and that it indicates that Google may not be able to compete effectively and isn't organized [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=571.76s)]
*  to compete effectively in AI just from a consumer competitiveness perspective, so [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=578.86s)]
*  You know investors are banging the table and in the past [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=584.14s)]
*  We saw this with meta [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=587.64s)]
*  I think it was towards the end of 22 if you guys remember and it was a similar situation [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=589.8s)]
*  Investors were like why are you investing in VR and AR? This is crazy [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=595.6s)]
*  Why do you have all these people that are getting overpaid? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=598.56s)]
*  And everyone started to write off the stock and the stock took a big nosedive for a period of time [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=601.2s)]
*  Just like Google's is right now and then the changes came and much like Google [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=605.68s)]
*  There's an individual with super voting shares who basically said you know what I? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=610.2s)]
*  Am gonna step in and we're gonna make these changes and we're gonna fix this organization [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=614.36s)]
*  we're gonna right size and we're gonna focus on the product winning and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=618.12s)]
*  Since then meta stock is up a tremendous amount [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=621.96s)]
*  I've X since then Google shares are down about 10% over the past two weeks [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=624.84s)]
*  By the way [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=628.88s)]
*  I was one of the stupid people to sell meta around that time and you're thinking was that they just [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=629.44s)]
*  Can't get out of their own way and the god-king is it's another. Yeah, it's exactly [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=633.76s)]
*  It's another one of these idiosyncratic problems [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=637.88s)]
*  You don't know what this individual is thinking and what he is individually going to do the point [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=639.64s)]
*  I'm making is that at Google now something has to give because the noise is so loud [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=644.68s)]
*  the board is hearing this left and right investors are [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=649.64s)]
*  Banging the table analysts are banging the table and I'll tell you a couple anecdotes internally employees are now banging the table [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=653.9599999999999s)]
*  a story I story I heard this week was that someone stood up in a meeting and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=660.1199999999999s)]
*  Said a couple of weeks ago if I had stood up in this meeting and said we can't show [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  Black people in the image generation at the rate that we're showing I would have been cast a racist [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=671.76s)]
*  And I didn't have permission to do that inside of the organization [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=678.04s)]
*  But today and everyone's like you're right [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=681.2399999999999s)]
*  You would not have been able to stand up in the organization say that [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=683.04s)]
*  But all the tenor has changed inside of Google with a lot of the employees that I've spoken with who are now saying I [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=685.64s)]
*  Can stand up and I can say that this group called responsible AI [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=690.8199999999999s)]
*  Has too much power and it's a one-sided [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=695.9399999999999s)]
*  asynchronous problem where they get to come in and say we need to change this and if you step up and disagree with them you [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=699.3399999999999s)]
*  Are deemed a racist you were deemed? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=704.54s)]
*  You know [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=706.78s)]
*  Culturally inappropriate which is easier to keep your head down [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=708.2199999999999s)]
*  It's easier to keep your head down a circumstance and keep collecting your RSA [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=711.14s)]
*  You wake up one day and you see the blunder that happened last week [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=715.14s)]
*  Yeah, and so now internally people are waking up and saying we need to change this and I heard that that's made its way [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=717.62s)]
*  Up to the higher ranks at Google and they're very actively it you know [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=722.34s)]
*  So there may be a moment here where Google stock which currently is [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=725.42s)]
*  Trading at just 17 times 20 25 consensus earnings [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=730.38s)]
*  Which is cheaper than all the other big tech companies by far and it's still growing core business is growing cloud is growing 20% [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=734.7s)]
*  Search is growing 15% all these other businesses YouTube's growing 20% a year [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=741.42s)]
*  It's a growth business. That's very profitable and [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=746.06s)]
*  It's trading at a very cheap discount [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=750.4599999999999s)]
*  So there's you know of the bull case is now is a great time to buy because it's so cheap and there could be this [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=752.0999999999999s)]
*  Moment where you know you see some of the changes that are needed internally [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=757.3s)]
*  To get the AI products to where they need to be to maintain the lead that is inherent because of sir [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=760.5s)]
*  So that would mean sacks it would require because we're using Zuckerberg as an example [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=766.3s)]
*  We could also bring Twitter and X into this it will require founder authority to come in there and make these changes [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=771.38s)]
*  It would require Larry and Sergey who have the super voting chairs to get in there and say hey [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=777.3000000000001s)]
*  This is all changing enough of this [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=781.48s)]
*  Do you think there's any chance of that happening or is Google just? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=783.82s)]
*  Too broken to fix and they're gonna just lose this opportunity and it's Microsoft under Steve Ballmer missing mobile and cloud [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=788.62s)]
*  Well to quote Jefferson the tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of Patriots and tyrants and [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=796.3s)]
*  I think there's something analogous here [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=803.8599999999999s)]
*  I mean you have to if you're gonna refresh this company you have to go in and [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=805.78s)]
*  You got to go in and make major cuts not just a rank-and-file, but leadership who doesn't get it [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=810.06s)]
*  And that's the only way it's gonna get fixed [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=815.5s)]
*  do I think that Larry and surgery are gonna come in and pull an Elon and go deep and figure out [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=817.9s)]
*  Which 50% or 20% of the company's actually good and doing their jobs probably not [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=824.92s)]
*  But is it possible that they could make a leadership change? Yeah, it's possible probable. I don't know. I mean I've heard that [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=831.28s)]
*  The company is the way it is because they like the way it is. I mean that [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=839.12s)]
*  They're part of the problem in effect. They don't see they don't see the problem or at least they haven't until now [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=842.96s)]
*  Maybe they'll get the wake-up call [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=848.36s)]
*  What do you think Shumar? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=850.36s)]
*  Watching while this happened. I think it's basically a small cadre of a thousand people [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=851.96s)]
*  that have built literally the [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=857.1600000000001s)]
*  most singular best business model and monopoly ever to be created on the internet and [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=859.72s)]
*  a whole bunch of other people that [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=865.64s)]
*  Have totally transformed this organization as SAAC said into [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=868.84s)]
*  Ability and a platform to reflect their views and [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=874.4000000000001s)]
*  So I don't not a shareholder of Google and outside of the tools I use I don't think I really have much [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=878.84s)]
*  voting power so I don't and I have so many alternatives now, so I actually think like the I [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=886.6400000000001s)]
*  Don't really care that much. I guess is the point. I think that the employees should care and [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=893.9200000000001s)]
*  The shareholders should care and they should come together and vote and I think SAACS is right [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=898.5200000000001s)]
*  I think the company is the way it is [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=903.1600000000001s)]
*  Because they've chosen to be that way [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=905.3199999999999s)]
*  and I think Freeberg is right, which is that there's a small group of people who have been protecting and [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=907.76s)]
*  Breathing life into the single greatest business ever built ever in the history of business [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=914.0799999999999s)]
*  But now we need to have a confrontation amongst all of these three different groups of people and they need to make some decisions [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=920.8399999999999s)]
*  Let me put a few data points in [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=926.48s)]
*  in play here Jay Cal and this all this all speaks to [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=929.56s)]
*  The problems being let's say deliberate as opposed to a glitch or an accident [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=934.0s)]
*  So first you have Sundar's letter to the company which [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=938.36s)]
*  There was a very interesting [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=943.84s)]
*  tweet by Lulu Chang [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=945.96s)]
*  Missouri who does comms at Activision and she writes a blog called flack [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=949.0400000000001s)]
*  She said quote the office expert just for the audience the comms expert. Yeah, so she kind of graded Sundar's letter and it was scorching [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=953.48s)]
*  She said the obfuscation [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=961.56s)]
*  Lack of clarity and fundamental failure to grasp the problem are due to a failure of leadership a poorly written email [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=963.56s)]
*  It's just the means through which that failure is revealed [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=969.8399999999999s)]
*  So that was one reaction [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=973.2399999999999s)]
*  Mark Andreessen had a series of posts indicating that the AI was programmed to be this way again [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=975.56s)]
*  It's not like a bug. It's more of a feature and that it's not an accident. This is this is happening because [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=982.52s)]
*  Because they chose to be this way and in fact he goes further and says that these companies are lobbying as a group with great [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=990.24s)]
*  Intensity to establish a government-protected cartel to lock in their shared agenda and corrupt products for decades to come [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=997.48s)]
*  Wow, I mean again, that's a really [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1004.48s)]
*  Scorching critique here and then you know, the the question I would ask is who's been fired for this [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1007.12s)]
*  I mean imagine if I don't know when he launched products had a launch that went this badly [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1013.5s)]
*  Do you think? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1018.88s)]
*  No heads would roll [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1020.52s)]
*  No heads have rolled and so you have to kind of wonder well, what if it's a structural issue sex [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1022.88s)]
*  I mean, I the point does resonate with me that there is a group internally and I think it's called the responsible AI team at [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1027.68s)]
*  Google and this team's job is to enforce those principles [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1034.96s)]
*  Remember that we brought up last week that they've defined and so they go in and they're like [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1039.1s)]
*  Well, you know if you just render an image of a software engineer and all the images are just white guys in hoods [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1042.68s)]
*  That's inappropriate because there are plenty of non white people you need to introduce diversity [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1048.56s)]
*  So then the programmers say okay [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1052.96s)]
*  We'll go ahead and overweight the model and make sure that there's diversity and you can't say no because otherwise you are deemed a racist [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1054.68s)]
*  So who's the individual that's responsible given that structural circumstance that exists within the organization? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1061.0s)]
*  It's more of a cultural and structural problem to me than you know, one I guess ultimately there's leadership that's lacking [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1066.38s)]
*  But actually I agree with that to some degree [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1072.66s)]
*  Let me describe how I think it works [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1075.64s)]
*  So what what I've heard about Google is that every meeting above a certain size has a DEI person in it [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1078.2s)]
*  I mean probably really probably so it's kind of like in the days of the Soviet Union [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1083.8400000000001s)]
*  Their military the Red Army would have in every division or unit there would be you know [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1088.64s)]
*  A commander or lieutenant and there'd be a commissar [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1095.0800000000002s)]
*  okay, and the commander reported up the chain and the commissar reported to the party and [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1098.4s)]
*  The commissar would just quietly take notes and all the meetings of the unit and if the commissar didn't like what the lieutenant was doing [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1103.4399999999998s)]
*  Lieutenant would be taken out and shot [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1109.9199999999998s)]
*  Okay. Now that's kind of a dramatic example. But the point is that in every large meeting at Google [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1111.8s)]
*  You've got this DEI commissar who's like quietly taking notes [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1118.7199999999998s)]
*  I'll point out that at Google the only person we can ever remember to get fired [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1122.36s)]
*  Was James Day more who was an engineer who complained about the political bias at Google? [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1127.2399999999998s)]
*  In other words, he was a whistleblower about the very problem. That's not manifested [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1133.12s)]
*  He's the only person you can think of to get fired at Google at Google was mocked on the show Silicon Valley [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1137.08s)]
*  It was called a hoolie. But remember this yeah [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1142.4399999999998s)]
*  You know they saw the guys [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1144.52s)]
*  Nobody ever got fired because it's a company where it's impossible to get fired [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1146.52s)]
*  Unless you blow the whistle on the political problem [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1149.82s)]
*  And I think that if you're sitting in those meetings [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1152.24s)]
*  With a DEI commissar present and you know or you have suspicions that the AI product is not working, right? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1156.08s)]
*  Are you really gonna speak up and risk the fate of a James Day more? Of course, you're not right [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1163.36s)]
*  So you're right free broke that it's a structural problem that there's probably a low-grade fear [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1169.04s)]
*  That's pervasive through the organization and no one's willing to say the Emperor wears no clothes [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1174.52s)]
*  The woke Emperor knows where it's not close because they don't want it. Why stick your neck out [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1179.32s)]
*  You may not know you're gonna get fired but you know, you're in sacks chance three years ago on Twitter [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1183.08s)]
*  Nobody would talk about certain topics related to DEI because it was in the aftermath of George Floyd and people just did not feel comfortable [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1188.8799999999999s)]
*  Even calling out something minor that was unfair. No, I would say they didn't feel comfortable until Bill Ackman [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1196.44s)]
*  Broke the seal on this just like a month ago where he really went after DEI [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1201.84s)]
*  I mean because remember the part of the reaction to Bill Ackman was like wow [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1206.52s)]
*  He's really going there even though everyone's saying that like basically agreed with him and knew that he was making a correct point [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1210.88s)]
*  But people were still afraid to like again call out this this woke Emperor [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1217.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and the way this works for people who are not super aware [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1222.68s)]
*  You have a language model and you know [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1226.96s)]
*  You write a bunch of code but then there are guardrails put in and then there are red teams and people who test it [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1228.92s)]
*  And so at the very least even if you were trying to do something with great intent as you pointed out Friedberg [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1233.24s)]
*  Hey, you know if we pull up a doctor it doesn't necessarily always be a white guy [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1239.04s)]
*  There are other people who are doctors in the world [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1243.52s)]
*  Somebody should have caught it in testing. They probably did Jason and they didn't report it who wants to report that problem? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1246.92s)]
*  That's an interesting rub. Yeah [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1252.84s)]
*  They didn't miss it they didn't miss it they didn't have the guts to [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1256.16s)]
*  You have to build or somebody built a reward model or people a reward model was built for the reinforcement learning [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1259.68s)]
*  From all the humans and their feedback so these decisions were explicit the question that is that you guys are framing is [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1266.8799999999999s)]
*  Was this though a case where it was explicitly imposed on people and people felt a fear of [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1275.2s)]
*  pushing back or [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1282.84s)]
*  Did they just agree and say this is a great decision and these rewards make a ton of sense and the whole point is [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1284.12s)]
*  That I think what this is highlighted is that's the truth that Google needs to figure out and [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1290.12s)]
*  They need to figure it out quickly because what is going to happen now is it's we I know [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1295.96s)]
*  I think we talked about this a year ago all Google needs to see is [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1301.12s)]
*  300 500 basis points of change and the market cap of this company is gonna get cut in half [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1305.36s)]
*  Okay, because there is only one way to go when you have 92 percent share of a market and that is down [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1312.2s)]
*  And so the setup for the stock is now that people are looking at this saying okay [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1318.08s)]
*  If I see 92 percent go to [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1323.32s)]
*  91 or 90 or 89 that's all that has to happen and people will say the trend is to 50% and [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1326.1599999999999s)]
*  You will price this company at a fraction of what it's worth today. So I think it's really critical [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1333.3999999999999s)]
*  This is the moment that the senior leadership that really understands business [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1338.72s)]
*  Can separate it from politics and decide is this a thing of fear? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1343.8799999999999s)]
*  Where there's one rogue group that's run amok or is this what we believe [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1347.96s)]
*  Because if it's the latter you just got to go with there's nothing you can do because you're not gonna replace [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1352.96s)]
*  300,000 employees or however many Google has but if it's a former Saks is right [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1357.5200000000002s)]
*  You're gonna have to some heads need to roll and they need to tell the marketplace [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1361.5600000000002s)]
*  That this was a mistake where a group of rogue employees got way out way too much power [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1366.1200000000001s)]
*  We were asleep at the job, but now we're awake they're fired and this is so they have two choices [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1371.0800000000002s)]
*  but in in all of these choices what I'm telling you on the [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1376.8799999999999s)]
*  dispassionate market side is if you see perplexity or anybody else [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1381.56s)]
*  Clip off 50 basis points or 100 basis points of share and search. This thing is going [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1386.8799999999999s)]
*  straight down by 50% by the way unless cloud takes off right because the other hedge that Google has is [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1392.16s)]
*  GCP and the tooling that they've built in GCP [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1398.24s)]
*  Can enable and support and be integral to a lot of alternatives and competitors to what ultimately might be search [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1402.14s)]
*  So I think there's also a play here in thinking about some of the hedges that Google has implicitly built into the business [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1409.06s)]
*  I'll just say one more thing on this structural point. I [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1415.3s)]
*  Kind of thought about this is when I started speaking to people internally about how this happened from a product perspective [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1418.82s)]
*  It felt a lot like when you talk to a lawyer as you guys know, you're making a business decision and there's some risk [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1424.58s)]
*  I mean think about Travis building uber and the lawyer will say it is illegal [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1430.4s)]
*  You need a medallion license to do what you're doing in the city and Travis is like, well, you know what? [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1435.4s)]
*  I'm gonna take that risk Brian Chesky and Airbnb [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1440.16s)]
*  He said, you know what? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1442.4s)]
*  I'm gonna take that risk and the problem is that like a lawyer's job is to tell you what you can't do to identify [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1442.96s)]
*  all the peril of your of your action and [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1448.4s)]
*  Then you as an executive or a business leader or a manager [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1452.52s)]
*  Your job is supposed to be [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1456.08s)]
*  To take that as one piece of input one piece of data that you then make the informed business decision about what's the right way to build? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1458.08s)]
*  This product what's the right way to build this company and I'll take on some risk [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1465.08s)]
*  and I think one of the challenges structurally inside of Google is that product leaders and other folks were never [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1468.08s)]
*  Enabled to make the decision that there were these as sacks pointed out kind of like [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1474.3600000000001s)]
*  Policing type organizations that were allowed to come in and veto things and the vetoing or make unilateral decisions and those vetoing on [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1479.78s)]
*  Whether it's waiting or some you know training data set or output [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1486.9399999999998s)]
*  That ends up killing the opportunity for the smart business leader to say that doesn't make sense [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1491.1s)]
*  we can this is where this is we're having founders in the organization every day changes everything because [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1495.4599999999998s)]
*  The founders would say hey, we were here to index the world's information. We're here to present the world's information [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1500.82s)]
*  We're not here to interpret it. We're not here to win hearts and minds. We're not here for a political agenda [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1505.94s)]
*  But there's a group of people there who it's apparent thing that they're there to change the world that [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1510.94s)]
*  Google is a vehicle for them to make social changes in the world and [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1517.14s)]
*  You know, that's art and there's other ways to do that and just paradoxically like Hamilton making the founding fathers [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1521.22s)]
*  Diverse and doing art, you know that can win Tony's in that context [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1528.1000000000001s)]
*  You could win tons of awards and acclaim and make incredible beautiful art [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1532.54s)]
*  But on the other side like people are not looking for Google to do that [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1537.18s)]
*  They're looking for Google to give them the answer and the data and then these people are thinking it's our job to actually [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1541.06s)]
*  Interpret the data for you as we kind of touched on this week. So [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1546.9s)]
*  This is I think look I think you guys are really close to the bullseye here, but I would just refine slightly what you're saying [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1551.3s)]
*  So here's I think it happens I I don't think this is a rogue group [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1557.78s)]
*  I actually think this is a highly empowered group within Google. I do agree with you. Yeah [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1560.9799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think what happens is Sundar says from the top that [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1565.3799999999999s)]
*  We're gonna be on the forefront of diversity and inclusion [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1570.34s)]
*  Because he personally believes that and that's the way the social winds are blowing and they think it's good for the company on some level [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1573.06s)]
*  Okay to implement that [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1580.26s)]
*  mantra or that platitude really [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1582.78s)]
*  Okay, lots of them I think the company has like this huge HR department and [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1584.86s)]
*  A lot of those people are basically fanatics. I mean, they're they're chosen career [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1589.86s)]
*  Yeah, they're trained Marxist basically and so they're the commissars and they're sitting in all these meetings and [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1594.1s)]
*  Again, they're the ones taking notes and they're the ones who push the company in a certain direction [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1600.3s)]
*  But you have to then go back to senior leadership and say it's their fault for letting people down [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1605.02s)]
*  But you have to then go back to senior leadership and say it's their fault for letting this happen [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1610.3799999999999s)]
*  Because they should have made a course correction. They should have realized what was happening. They should have realized that through a combination of [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1615.54s)]
*  Bias and through this sort of like overly empowered [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1624.06s)]
*  HR team who are pulling a legal card [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1629.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean Friedberg's right about that they're saying that our point of view is the law which isn't true [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1631.6599999999999s)]
*  But they're basically pulling the legal card and pushing the whole organization in a certain direction [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1636.1599999999999s)]
*  it was up to leadership to realize what was going on and make a correction and [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1640.92s)]
*  The the thing that you're seeing now is that in the face of what's happened [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1646.84s)]
*  The statement that we got really doesn't cut it. What are they used to word problematic? Yeah, exactly [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1652.08s)]
*  They're describing as a glitch or a bug. It's not yeah [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1658.0s)]
*  It's a much deeper problem and so therefore you give it gives no confidence that [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1660.6799999999998s)]
*  The solution is going to be pursued in as comprehensive manners as necessary [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1666.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's just that memo is a tip-off that there is a 20,000 30,000 person riff and a reorganization [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1671.28s)]
*  And they're just gonna keep cutting the DI group and they've already met and Google have cut the DI groups a bit [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1678.04s)]
*  I don't know if it's about as much about cutting as much as it is about [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1683.7199999999998s)]
*  Empowering if you said to the product leaders you can make the decision [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1686.9199999999998s)]
*  Dei and responsible AI and whatever other groups they're gonna inform you on their point of view [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1692.6799999999998s)]
*  But they're not gonna tell you what your point of view that's the idea was pulling the legal card [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1698.8799999999999s)]
*  They're saying this is the law. They're saying that [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1702.96s)]
*  Right if you don't do things the way we tell you Google is gonna be hit with a civil rights lawsuit. That's what they're saying [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1705.56s)]
*  That's what they're saying [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1712.08s)]
*  Oh, well, I mean, let's see if leadership can overcome that threat [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1713.16s)]
*  But I think that's exactly the threat that is keeping the organization from resolving this problem or could keep the organization [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1716.8400000000001s)]
*  I think that's that but I also wouldn't underestimate the bias. So, you know, everybody they're not I shouldn't say everybody but [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1723.32s)]
*  It's a very liberal culture, right? It's a monoculture. So when you're swimming in that much bias, it's hard to see [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1729.72s)]
*  Right. Yeah, when everybody is left to center, I mean just look at something like political contributions, right? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1735.96s)]
*  It's ninety something percent are [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1741.28s)]
*  Democratic, I mean like high 90s. So it's just a [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1744.0800000000002s)]
*  liberal bubble [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1748.48s)]
*  basically and so right when everybody's liberal it's very hard to see when [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1749.8000000000002s)]
*  You know the results are way off center as well [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1754.48s)]
*  Also, if you give you give people this job, like how are they? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1757.52s)]
*  What are they gonna do every day Friedberg if they've been given the job DEI and they've been given the job to trust and safety [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1760.5600000000002s)]
*  They're looking to fill their time and make an impact [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1765.8400000000001s)]
*  You got to I think maybe have less of these people I [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1768.28s)]
*  Know Sean McGuire is a partner at Sequoia and he used to be a [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1772.8s)]
*  Member of the team at Google Ventures when it was called Google Ventures and he did a Twitter post [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1776.6799999999998s)]
*  Do you guys see this? Yeah, where he said when he was at Google he was told by his manager [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1781.0s)]
*  I'm not really supposed to tell you this it could get me fired [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1785.84s)]
*  But you're one of the highest performing people here, but I can't promote you right now because I have a quota [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1788.1599999999999s)]
*  My hands are tied. You'll get the next slot. Please be patient. I'm really sorry [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1793.12s)]
*  It ultimately led Sean to leave Google and [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1797.0s)]
*  You know the rest is history. He's a partner at Sequoia now [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1800.5600000000002s)]
*  You're saying because he's a white male because he's a white male. Yeah, and so the you know [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1804.44s)]
*  Yeah, no, I had the same thing happen to me at AOL when I was at AOL and Shabat was there at the same time [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1810.68s)]
*  the whole organization was white men from [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1815.8s)]
*  Virginia whatever and [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1819.16s)]
*  They gave me an SVP title and I said well I want the EVP one and they're like, you know [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1821.88s)]
*  What we can't have any more white males in that position right now [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1826.64s)]
*  We have to like get some more women and people of color in that position and they told me you'll have the same comp [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1830.0s)]
*  And bonus, but we just can't give you the title [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1835.5600000000002s)]
*  Jamal, do you think these like [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1838.1200000000001s)]
*  Race and gender driven quotas [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1841.72s)]
*  make sense for HR departments to try and [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1845.28s)]
*  Enforce upon managers [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1849.44s)]
*  To me to increase diversity. I mean is that a good objective for an organization to have this is like a topic a lot of people [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1852.2s)]
*  I've heard kind of flip back and forth on hi [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1858.36s)]
*  There is no company where I have majority control where I have an HR department. You don't have an HR department [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1860.36s)]
*  No, say more why I think that it's very important. You should go to a very respected lawyer at a third-party firm [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1865.72s)]
*  someone very visible and [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1872.9199999999998s)]
*  they're a colder type person and [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1875.04s)]
*  You should work with that law firm and retain them so that you have an escape valve if there are [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1878.12s)]
*  any kind of serious issues that that need to be escalated so that you can get them into the hands of a [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1885.1599999999999s)]
*  dispassionate third-party person who can then [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1892.1999999999998s)]
*  appropriately inform the board the CEO and investigate [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1894.9199999999998s)]
*  So that that covers sort of all the bad things that can happen [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1899.12s)]
*  Then there are buckets of I think good things [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1902.6799999999998s)]
*  One one important set of things is around benefits. My perspective is that [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1905.52s)]
*  The team should build their own benefits package that they want [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1911.52s)]
*  they should understand the P&L of the company that they work for they should be given a budget and [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1915.32s)]
*  In in my companies again, what I do is I allow committees to form and I ask those committees to be [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1920.8s)]
*  Diverse, but what I mean by diverse is I want somebody who has a sick partner [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1927.92s)]
*  I want somebody who [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1933.6s)]
*  Has a family I want somebody who's young and single [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1935.8s)]
*  So that the diversity of benefits reflects what all these people need [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1938.8799999999999s)]
*  They go and talk to folks they come back and they choose on behalf of the whole company and there's a voting mechanism [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1942.52s)]
*  Then when it comes to hiring, I think what has to happen is that the person that for whom that person will end up working for? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1948.08s)]
*  It's the head of engineering. It's the head of sales. Those are the people that should be running the hiring processes [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1956.28s)]
*  I don't like to outsource it to recruiters. I don't like to outsource it to HR [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1962.8s)]
*  So when you strip all of these jobs away [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1967.12s)]
*  HR doesn't have a role and what is left over is the very dark part of HR in most organizations [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1970.0s)]
*  Which is the police person the policeman right? What is what is sacks called the commissar? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1975.72s)]
*  That is why everybody hates HR [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1980.68s)]
*  I've never met a company where that is a successful role over long periods of time. They are this conflict [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1983.08s)]
*  Creating entity inside of an organization that slows organizations down so [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1990.6200000000001s)]
*  That allows me to empower [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1996.22s)]
*  individuals to actually design the benefits that they want to hire the team that they want and I let them understand the P&L in a [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=1998.7800000000002s)]
*  Very clear transparent way and the results are what the results are you want more bonuses hire better people? [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2005.9s)]
*  And then what I do is at the end of every year [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2010.8200000000002s)]
*  I talk about this distribution of talent and I make sure we are [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2013.0600000000002s)]
*  Identifying the bottom five or ten percent. They need to be managed up or they must be fired [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2017.82s)]
*  Every year and [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2025.1000000000001s)]
*  It does not matter how big the company is [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2026.94s)]
*  You must manage up or out the bottom five to ten percent and in some cases [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2029.02s)]
*  I'm talking about one person because it's a small company and in other cases [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2033.46s)]
*  I'm talking about thirty or forty people so just hire the best person for the job. No you eliminate HR [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2037.14s)]
*  Yeah, you empower the team make that make allow them to make their own decisions [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2042.42s)]
*  Measure it hold them accountable [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2047.94s)]
*  Right. So if you have a salesperson who just hires their I don't know [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2050.34s)]
*  15 sorority sisters or fraternity brothers, whatever it is, and it just becomes not a diverse group [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2055.58s)]
*  Well, hold on it is what it is that still may be diverse [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2061.58s)]
*  This is my point like the the thing is that like there's different ways to sell there's different sales motions [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2064.1s)]
*  There's the sort of like elephant hunting kind of sales model. There's the dialing for dollars thing [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2069.82s)]
*  So even those 15 sorority sisters the way you describe it could actually be diverse [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2074.94s)]
*  My point is that kind of superficial marking based on immutable traits will not yield a great organization instead [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2079.38s)]
*  It's you're empowered to hire whomever you want. Just know that at the end of the year [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2086.38s)]
*  We're gonna measure them your bonus their bonus the company's performance performance. Yeah performance [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2090.38s)]
*  I mean Frank Slootman said this and he got barbecued at some point [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2095.54s)]
*  I don't have time to do this diversity stuff [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2100.18s)]
*  By the way in my companies like for example, like when you do sock to compliance you have to generate these reports [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2103.1s)]
*  okay, especially for some of our customers some of our companies that actually show the diversity of our team and [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2109.12s)]
*  When we measure them on the immutable traits that whatever they represent as their gender [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2115.74s)]
*  Whatever they represent as other dimensions. We are incredibly incredibly diverse anyways [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2122.22s)]
*  But the way that I've seen a startup that isn't diverse, you know, it's looking Valley attracts such a diverse mix of people [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2129.18s)]
*  You know, what do we know about success factors for startups number one the ones are successful have a cultural meritocracy [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2137.7s)]
*  Number two, they're non bureaucratic and they don't have too much [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2145.3399999999997s)]
*  Gna basically overhead in the company [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2149.5s)]
*  Now all those things are [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2153.2999999999997s)]
*  Contradicted by having a large HR team or especially a DEI organization, right? They add bureaucracy they add overhead and [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2156.7s)]
*  What's that pips? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2166.54s)]
*  Performance improvement they cut into well pips are great. I fit people all the time. Does it work? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2168.54s)]
*  I mean, I know some people were just like these pips don't work [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2173.8599999999997s)]
*  If you're an unperforming member of the team and you've been identified in the bottom five or ten percent [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2176.48s)]
*  We have a responsibility as management [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2180.4199999999996s)]
*  To coach you up or to get you to an organization where you're not in the bottom five or ten percent [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2183.06s)]
*  That's the right thing to do for people you do that by being very transparent and writing it down [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2188.7000000000003s)]
*  You are not good at these things [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2193.3s)]
*  You're underperforming in these things fix them or you will not be here. That's a very fair thing to tell somebody [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2195.34s)]
*  Yeah, look how you want to implement your own meritocracy? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2201.66s)]
*  I think there's different ways for founders to do that. The point is you want these companies to be a meritocracy [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2204.42s)]
*  You don't want [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2209.3s)]
*  Advancement in the company to be based on factors other than skill merit hard work things like that performance [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2211.14s)]
*  We know performance we know that's a bad bad path to go on [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2217.02s)]
*  I think a lot of founders don't understand that DEI is not something they have to do [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2220.42s)]
*  They don't have to have a DEI organization. This is somehow become a thing. It's it's not required and [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2225.62s)]
*  I think people are realizing like why would you do that? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2232.5s)]
*  Why would you create this large bureaucracy in the company that undercuts the meritocracy? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2235.42s)]
*  That adds a lot of costs and that slows you down [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2240.46s)]
*  None of those things that will help your company what you need to have [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2243.3s)]
*  I think Jamoth laid out some really good best practices. You should have an outside law firm [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2246.1800000000003s)]
*  That I would say is you could call it HR law, but I would just call it employment law [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2251.7400000000002s)]
*  I would say like a non ideological [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2256.1s)]
*  Partner an expert in employment law who sets up your company correctly and to whom you can take a complaint if [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2259.06s)]
*  An HR complaint gets raised through the chain your company [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2266.1s)]
*  You do have to take it very seriously and that's be a proper investigation and that's probably best handled by an outside lawyer [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2269.5s)]
*  So get that outside lawyer and then I buy the way always there's never a case where your co-worker [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2275.14s)]
*  Should know the intimate details of any of those say and that's what also creates this [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2281.66s)]
*  Horribly rotten culture in HR where these people act like gatekeepers of secret information salary information [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2286.78s)]
*  Bonus information and then all of the other things. Oh, you know, did you know this person did this with? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2293.82s)]
*  It's terrible to have that inside of a company [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2299.98s)]
*  It should go to a dispassionate third-party person whose job it is to maintain confidentiality and discretion [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2302.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, while investigating the truth. Yeah when HR is too powerful in a company [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2307.64s)]
*  That's a red flag at the end of the day HR should be an administrative function [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2312.26s)]
*  their job should be to get people on boarded sign their offer letter and their [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2315.98s)]
*  confidentiality and [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2321.94s)]
*  Invention assignment agreement and set them up in payroll and get them benefits and that kind of stuff [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2323.12s)]
*  it should fundamentally be an administrative function and [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2328.34s)]
*  If it starts getting more powerful than that, it means there's been a usurpation [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2331.86s)]
*  You don't even need people for that like you have software that does that now and it's all automated [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2336.36s)]
*  You know you send them a link you go to your favorite HR site and boom. It's done [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2340.98s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think you need a lot of people doing this anything you want to add to this discussion freeberg as we as we move [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2344.9s)]
*  On to the next topic. I think that unfortunately the term [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2349.6s)]
*  diversity [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2353.04s)]
*  Equity inclusion has been captured along as Chamath points out a single vector [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2354.42s)]
*  which is this immutable trait of your racial identity or gender and [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2359.94s)]
*  I think the more important aspect for the success of a team for the success of an organization is to find [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2365.62s)]
*  Diversity in the people that comes from different backgrounds different experiences different ways of thinking and [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2372.6600000000003s)]
*  so I I'm not a huge fan of [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2379.1800000000003s)]
*  race based metrics [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2382.3s)]
*  Or gender based metrics driving. I'm generally [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2384.82s)]
*  More oriented around be blind to those those those variables and focus much more in the variables that can actually influence the outcome of the organization [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2388.62s)]
*  Yeah, one of them [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2397.62s)]
*  Great paradoxes of this as well as we are moving to a much more multicultural mixed race society [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2399.06s)]
*  Anyway, people filling out forms a lot of our kids [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2405.68s)]
*  You know our could pick two or three of the different boxes on a DEI form [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2408.42s)]
*  It's it's not going to make much of a difference in the coming decades [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2412.46s)]
*  Alright issue to Google go splashy cache. It's licensing deals for training data and it's now becoming a bit of a pattern [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2415.58s)]
*  Google we talked about I think just last week had [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2423.1s)]
*  Done a deal with reddit for 60 million dollars that's reportedly per year [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2426.06s)]
*  today [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2431.9s)]
*  Stack overflow is now using its overflow API to train Gemini. No word on the contract value [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2433.06s)]
*  I did get some back channel that it's a multi-year non-exclusive deal according to reds s1 [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2438.94s)]
*  They've already closed 200 million worth of AI licensing deals over the next two to three years [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2444.5s)]
*  So, you know, maybe it's gonna be 75 million a year 100 million a year who knows how big that business can get we're gonna talk [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2449.54s)]
*  about the [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2454.98s)]
*  s1 from reddit in just a moment and [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2455.98s)]
*  There this is on top of all the other licensing deals that have occurred after spring or an opening [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2459.58s)]
*  I remember that one and opening eyes and talks reportedly with CNN Fox and time to license their [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2463.42s)]
*  Content that comes on the heels of that blockbuster New York Times opening a lawsuit that we talked about [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2469.98s)]
*  I don't know ten episodes ago and opening eyes lawyers are trying to get that one just to give you a little update on it [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2474.98s)]
*  They're trying to get that case dismissed saying that the New York Times hacked [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2480.08s)]
*  GPT to get certain results [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2483.14s)]
*  And that the New York Times took tens of thousands of tries to generate the results yada yada [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2485.54s)]
*  And they said here's the quote from the filing from open AI the allegations in the Times complaint do not meet its famous [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2490.3799999999997s)]
*  Lee rigorous [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2497.3799999999997s)]
*  Journalistic standards both open AI and Google and Gemini have been furiously guard railing their systems as we talked about as well to and stop [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2498.7s)]
*  Copyright infringement like trying to make pictures of Darth Vader and that kind of stuff [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2506.18s)]
*  Jamal you've talked a little bit about your attack [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2509.46s)]
*  2.0 framework, maybe you could talk about what you see happening here with all these licensing deals and [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2511.94s)]
*  What it means for startups in the AI space? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2517.26s)]
*  Well, just to maybe catch everybody up tac is this thing called traffic acquisition cost and you can see it most [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2521.7000000000003s)]
*  importantly in Google's [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2529.9s)]
*  Quarterly releases which is that what they realized? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2532.46s)]
*  Very early on at the beginning of the search wars in the early 2000s is that they could pay people to offer Google search [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2535.54s)]
*  People would use it and then it would generate so much money that they could give them a huge rev share [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2544.6600000000003s)]
*  And it would still make money. So I remember Jason when you and I were at a well [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2549.54s)]
*  This is the first time I met Omead. We were flying back to California [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2553.58s)]
*  we were both in Dulles at the same time in like [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2557.48s)]
*  2003 or four and [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2561.2200000000003s)]
*  That's when Omead did the first big search deal between AOL and Google and it was it was I want to say hundreds of millions [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2563.66s)]
*  of dollars back. Yeah [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2569.98s)]
*  Where Google pays you upfront you have to syndicate Google search and then they clean it up on the back end with some kind [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2571.18s)]
*  of rev sure [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2577.9599999999996s)]
*  So what's incredible is that that process has escalated to a point now where for example on the iPhone? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2578.74s)]
*  It's somewhere between 18 and 20 odd billion dollars a year is what now Google pays Apple [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2586.22s)]
*  So that's the traffic acquisition cost 1.0 rule tack 1.0 and [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2591.66s)]
*  I just said that we should call this tack 2.0 [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2597.82s)]
*  except now what Google is doing is instead of paying for search they're actually paying for your data and [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2601.06s)]
*  Saying give it to me so that I can train my models and make it better [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2606.26s)]
*  And I think that that's an incredible thing both. It's very smart for Google [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2609.34s)]
*  But also it's great for these businesses because it's an extremely high margin [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2613.9s)]
*  Thing to do when you have a really good corpus of data that is very unique [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2618.54s)]
*  So in the case of reddit that 60 million dollar deal [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2622.2599999999998s)]
*  I didn't I looked through the s1 to try to figure out whether it was a multi-year deal or not [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2625.34s)]
*  It wasn't totally clear [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2629.9s)]
*  But the point is that you know Google's paying reddit 60 million bucks and Jason you just said that there they've done a couple more [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2632.38s)]
*  Of these things that's incredible [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2637.98s)]
*  This tack 2.0 thing is amazing. So if you're an entrepreneur [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2640.7s)]
*  That has really unique training data or really unique data [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2643.42s)]
*  You'll be able to license and sell that and that'll be an incremental revenue stream to everything you do in the near future. That's amazing [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2647.1s)]
*  That's what tack 2.0 is. This is going to be incredible for the entire [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2652.78s)]
*  Content and community based industries. You think this could sustain content creation where advertising has become very difficult, Sax? [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2656.78s)]
*  I guess my question to touch your mouth would be do you think this is going to be available? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2663.42s)]
*  To small websites they'll somehow be some sort of program or because I mean reddit is one of the biggest sources of content on the entire [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2668.86s)]
*  Web, right? It's like a top five traffic site with [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2674.5400000000004s)]
*  Tons and tons of user generated content. Yes, I think like a small publication would be able to make these types of deals [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2678.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, and in fact, I think like if you go back to search 1.0 [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2684.78s)]
*  That's exactly what these small companies were able to do which was in a more automated way [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2687.82s)]
*  They were able to basically partner with the small companies to make these types of deals [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2692.0600000000004s)]
*  And in that example what they would say is here google [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2695.9s)]
*  Why don't you just run your ads on our page, right? And that was sort of in that web 1.0 world [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2698.94s)]
*  So google had solutions for the largest companies on the internet all the way to the smallest [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2703.5800000000004s)]
*  And in this tack 2.0 world, I do think that that it works in that way as well [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2708.78s)]
*  The problem in the in that world if it's a small website that says here's my training data [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2713.82s)]
*  The question is how do you attribute how much incrementality is there? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2719.5800000000004s)]
*  The question is how do you attribute how much incremental value a model? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2723.1s)]
*  Derived from it versus something else. And so I think that that part has to get figured out [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2727.98s)]
*  And so, you know what google will be able to pay you will probably be pretty diminimously small if you're small right now [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2734.94s)]
*  So, you know to your point if the upper bound is 60 million for reddit, then the average website is going to get a few hundred bucks [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2741.02s)]
*  But that still may be a good start and when google figures out how to monetize this stuff or somebody else [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2747.66s)]
*  Where then they can give you back some way to make money. I think I think that there's a real [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2753.5s)]
*  Monetization here I really do you took the other side of this [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2759.88s)]
*  But now that you see the market-based solution starting to [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2765.3399999999997s)]
*  Emerge what do you think of this market-based solution? I think it's a got legs [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2769.1s)]
*  well, i'm not [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2773.58s)]
*  Convinced that this looks like tech in the traditional sense where you're basically buying a continuous stream of traffic [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2774.86s)]
*  And then you're helping to monetize that traffic [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2783.58s)]
*  That's effectively what google did in the ad syndication business and does today that business makes about 10 billion a quarter at google [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2785.58s)]
*  And they're paying [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2793.8199999999997s)]
*  Call it 70 to 80 cents on every dollar back out to the owners of that traffic the folks where that traffic is derived from [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2795.3399999999997s)]
*  I would say that [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2802.46s)]
*  This looks a lot more like the content licensing deals to build a proprietary audience [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2804.06s)]
*  Which is effectively what netflix [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2810.62s)]
*  Did they paid studios for content? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2813.8199999999997s)]
*  Apple does this they have proprietary content that they pay producers to make and they put on apple tv [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2817.74s)]
*  Amazon does this and so on this is a lot more like that where there are content creators out there [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2824.3799999999997s)]
*  Whether that content is proprietary like the new york times or user generated like reddit [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2829.9s)]
*  And what they're trying to do is acquire that content to build a better product on google search [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2834.3799999999997s)]
*  And i'm, not sure how you get paid a continuous licensing stream [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2839.34s)]
*  For that content once you've trained the model the content gets old it gets stale at some point in a lot of cases like news [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2843.42s)]
*  and then eventually [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2849.6600000000003s)]
*  If you don't have a high quality continuous stream of content [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2851.6600000000003s)]
*  It's not worth as much anymore to give you guys a sense [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2855.1800000000003s)]
*  Humans generate in total. Well, let me just give you some stats. There's about a million petabytes of data on the internet today [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2858.54s)]
*  And humans are generating about 2500 petabytes of data [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2865.6600000000003s)]
*  New data per day right now. Remember I shared a couple weeks ago youtube's generating about two petabytes of data [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2870.1400000000003s)]
*  uh per day [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2875.9s)]
*  Half of all data generated is never used [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2877.98s)]
*  So this is like records and files and stuff that gets put on files [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2881.34s)]
*  Log files get stored somewhere never accessed never used the majority of the rest of that data is not in the public domain [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2885.5s)]
*  It's not on the internet [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2891.9s)]
*  So there is a lot of data out there what some people might call dark data to train on [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2893.34s)]
*  and I think that as the identification of [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2899.42s)]
*  Better sources of training data and the value of training data right now [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2903.42s)]
*  We're in this kind of shotgun approach. We're trying to blast out and you know source lots of content lots of data [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2907.42s)]
*  Just like over time netflix got better at figuring out what content to buy and what to pay for it [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2913.42s)]
*  And they're the best at it [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2918.38s)]
*  I think so, too [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2920.46s)]
*  Will google and others figure out what data is actually particularly useful what it's worth and what to pay for it [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2921.82s)]
*  And so there's a lot of data out there to go and identify to mine [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2929.02s)]
*  To pay license fees to get access to whether those are continuous license fees or one time is still tbd [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2932.7000000000003s)]
*  That's a key issue. Yeah, so I think we're still a little bit early to know if this is like, you know [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2938.3s)]
*  a continuous model like attack type business or [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2942.86s)]
*  If these are sort of chunky type deals [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2945.8999999999996s)]
*  And we don't really know what the real value is yet and that all changes over time and remember that the rate of data generation is increasing [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2947.8999999999996s)]
*  So while we're generating 2,500 petabytes of data per day as a species on the internet [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2955.1s)]
*  That number is going up every day. And so every year all the old data becomes worth even less [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2959.66s)]
*  So this is all changing fairly dynamically and I think [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2964.46s)]
*  There's a lot still to be figured out on what the monetization model will be for content creators and and how that's going to change over time [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2968.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and this is a really good point. Some things will be [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2974.7s)]
*  Like the sopranos or seinfeld or simpsons where that library's worth a fortune and people will pay a billion dollars a half billion dollars some [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2977.42s)]
*  No one's no one's paying a lot for old nfl games, you know nick found it by the way reddit's licensing deal was 203 million over [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2984.94s)]
*  It says two to three years. So let's assume it's call it three just to be safe [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2992.38s)]
*  So it's about you know, 60 65 million dollars a year. It doesn't say whether the deal with google is exclusive [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=2995.8199999999997s)]
*  Wow, so they could do they could do that same licensing deal multiple times that's interesting none of these are exclusive it seems [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3001.66s)]
*  This is what I don't understand [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3007.58s)]
*  Why why don't you do head deals like with folks like reddit where you actually do it exclusively like it seems like it's more valuable [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3008.86s)]
*  to spend a multiple of this number [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3015.82s)]
*  For for one of the big seven [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3018.46s)]
*  Who have tens of billions of dollars of cash anyways block the other players and block everybody else [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3020.54s)]
*  That just seems so much smaller gets capped if i'm reddit. I don't want to do that deal [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3025.02s)]
*  Yeah, reddit may not put it on the table [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3028.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because then my multiple is capped like the way I can monetize my content is now set and i'm done [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3029.8199999999997s)]
*  This is why we're gonna get bought reddit investors are like, oh you're worth five times ipa tag, you know, that's it [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3035.02s)]
*  Reddit core stack overflow. They're gonna just get taken out. I think this is I think this is going to be the new model [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3040.4599999999996s)]
*  Is it around actually didn't core race? Uh 50 500 recently. I think they're gonna get taken out [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3044.8599999999997s)]
*  I I think these businesses will become too valuable because they do have ongoing content that just keeps getting generated [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3050.06s)]
*  You started web blogs, right? Yeah, yeah gadget like blogging [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3056.86s)]
*  But think about the value of that content today. It's negligible like it was very valuable at the time [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3060.38s)]
*  Yeah [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3065.5800000000004s)]
*  And as time went on more content was being created a hundred times a thousand times ten thousand times more content [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3065.82s)]
*  That started to overshadow the value of that content at the time the acquisition was done [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3071.6600000000003s)]
*  It made a ton of sense [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3075.1800000000003s)]
*  But all of a sudden two years later, particularly with the rate at which data is growing on the internet [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3076.3s)]
*  It's like does it make sense to buy any content anymore? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3080.86s)]
*  So you well on the other side of that is historical content could be worth a lot of money, especially some could be [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3083.18s)]
*  Yeah, so if you had the charlie rose archive as an example [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3089.58s)]
*  What is you know, he's probably interviewed kissinger 10 times and he's interviewed kissinger for you know, 10 hours [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3092.7s)]
*  I've got two almost 2 000 episodes of podcasts. I've done with startups over 13 years like [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3097.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, this week in startups archive is going to be worth something at some point, right? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3104.14s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna be worth 61. What are all baseball games worth right? Like I mean [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3107.02s)]
*  Yeah, so watches they're not watchable and I don't think the data from them is particularly important so I agree on that one [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3111.02s)]
*  But historical stuff. Yeah, we don't know but I just question how much of reddit's content is actually like [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3117.6600000000003s)]
*  Long-term valuable versus like they're covering a topic and they're talking about interesting stuff and then it's a really excellent point [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3123.5600000000004s)]
*  It's a really really excellent point [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3129.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, uh, and we'll figure that out [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3131.9s)]
*  Okay [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3133.7400000000002s)]
*  And that's why I think it's like it's the early days of knowing how to value all this content particularly for llms [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3133.98s)]
*  And so we don't really know yet over the next year. This will all start to become clearer, but it's it's again [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3137.98s)]
*  Happened in music licensing. Yeah, right, but if if all the content creators kind of unionize [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3143.66s)]
*  Then it might increase [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3149.9s)]
*  Kind of like the yeah like music industry has ascap and other socialists. I love it [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3152.78s)]
*  Well, i'm not advocating for this but the point i'm making is if they can't unionize then there's a lot there's just a [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3157.34s)]
*  Huge number of vendors of content and so [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3164.7000000000003s)]
*  Models will need to buy some but as long as they can get some they don't need to have all [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3168.3s)]
*  and therefore it's basically highly competitive among suppliers and [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3172.3s)]
*  There's a very limited number of buyers. So that tends to be why the news industry should have always had a federation because they could have just [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3176.78s)]
*  Said to google hey, we're going to de-index ourselves from the google search engine [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3182.94s)]
*  And so you won't have the new york times washington post la times [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3187.42s)]
*  You're just not going to have any of us unless you give us x y and z and they were just [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3189.98s)]
*  Too stupid and not coordinated to do it music industry the exact opposite you you try to do anything with the music industry [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3194.62s)]
*  They're going to come down on you like a ton of bricks to this day. I see what's [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3201.9s)]
*  All that's actually really interesting. Yeah, if all the um old school legacy [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3205.7400000000002s)]
*  newspapers and magazines magazines so on logs basically formed their own [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3210.84s)]
*  whatever [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3216.14s)]
*  Trade association. Yeah, that would have been powerful [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3218.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's what murdoch wanted murdoch saw clearly he was like, you know, google's the enemy here [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3221.2599999999998s)]
*  They're going to take all of our revenue and they're going to get all our customer names [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3225.5s)]
*  And we're not going to even know the names of our customers [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3227.9s)]
*  All right issue three clonacrush's customer queries with ai you may have seen this trending on x and twitter and in the press [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3230.06s)]
*  If you don't know clona, they're a swedish fintech company. They do that buy now pay later stuff. I think they were the [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3236.54s)]
*  originators of that online and they put out a press release with some really eye-popping claims [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3241.7999999999997s)]
*  AI assistants are now doing the work of 700 full-time agents at clona they moved [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3247.26s)]
*  issue resolving times from 11 minutes with humans to two minutes with ai [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3253.98s)]
*  And customer satisfaction is on par with human agents [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3260.2200000000003s)]
*  And it said its resolutions are more accurate than humans creating a 25 drop in repeat inquiries that tracks [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3264.1400000000003s)]
*  and so far their [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3270.5400000000004s)]
*  AI which they built with open ai has had 2.3 million conversations accounting for two-thirds of clonacrush's customer support [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3272.2999999999997s)]
*  service chats clona estimates its ai agent will drive [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3279.66s)]
*  Wait for it a 40 million dollar increase in profits this year [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3283.58s)]
*  We could talk a little bit more about cloner and their valuations, but freeberg. What what do you think this? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3288.62s)]
*  Means if we're in year, this is the start of year two of chat gpt as like a phenomenon. Let's say [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3293.98s)]
*  What do we think year three looks like I think the tech the techno pessimist point of view is oh my god [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3301.3399999999997s)]
*  Look at all these jobs that are getting lost [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3305.74s)]
*  I think the optimistic point of view is that that company has all of that excess capital now [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3307.74s)]
*  to reinvest in doing other things that capital doesn't just become profits that flow out the door and [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3313.3399999999997s)]
*  Everyone's done with that money and that money just gets put away in a sock that money gets reinvested [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3318.94s)]
*  And that money gets reinvested in higher order functioning work [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3324.06s)]
*  And that's really where there's an opportunity to move the workforce overall forward [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3327.7400000000002s)]
*  Which is what I think is super exciting and i'm super positive about we've seen this in every technological [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3331.82s)]
*  Evolution that's happened in human history from you know, the plow in agriculture to automobiles to computing and to now ai [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3338.44s)]
*  That you know humans moved from manual labor to knowledge work to now ideally and hopefully more creative work [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3347.26s)]
*  And so I do think that it isn't just about eliminating jobs and making more money [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3354.3s)]
*  But it's about enabling the creation of entirely new class of work whether that's prompt engineering [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3359.5s)]
*  Or you know building entirely new businesses that simply can't exist today or perhaps even downscaling businesses where you no longer need to have a [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3365.42s)]
*  10,000 person organization [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3372.04s)]
*  Smaller organizations can be stood up as startups to start to replace large functioning organizations [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3373.82s)]
*  So, I don't know. I think it's a time of great opportunity [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3378.78s)]
*  I know that some people would view it as being highly shocking [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3381.34s)]
*  I think it's inevitable that human knowledge labor where the job of the human is simply the ingestion of data and then [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3383.82s)]
*  Communicate an output of data seems like it will eventually be replaced by computing somehow [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3389.48s)]
*  And this is happening now in an accelerated way with these llms [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3394.6200000000003s)]
*  So I think that what we should focus on and think about is what are all the new businesses all the new jobs all the new opportunities? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3397.5800000000004s)]
*  That are just couldn't have existed 10 years ago that are now emerging that are very exciting as the workforce transitions [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3404.3s)]
*  Sacked you by this techno utopian view of this all these jobs that are going to obviously be retired [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3410.06s)]
*  Are going to open up the opportunity for these humans to do even better work at klona or do you think? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3417.5800000000004s)]
*  It's just going to go straight to the bottom line [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3423.26s)]
*  Well, it sounds like they're able to eliminate a lot of frontline customer support roles by using ai which is what I would expect [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3426.06s)]
*  Yeah, I think this is a very natural application for ai [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3434.46s)]
*  You know [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3438.78s)]
*  It was already the case that you could pretty much find answers to questions by searching the faq things like this this [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3439.26s)]
*  This is an even better way of doing that [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3445.5800000000004s)]
*  So so look I I believe that this will be a big area for ai is saving on again [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3448.2200000000003s)]
*  I use the word frontline customer support because the way [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3452.6200000000003s)]
*  That customer support is typically organized is there's level one level two level three [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3456.2200000000003s)]
*  the [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3460.78s)]
*  more difficult [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3461.98s)]
*  Queries or cases get escalated up the chain depending on how hard they are [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3463.42s)]
*  And I think the ai will do a really good job eliminating level one. It'll start to eating to level two, but you're probably going to need [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3467.82s)]
*  Humans to deal with the more complex cases [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3475.1s)]
*  Now the question is where do those displaced humans go? I think there's going to be new jobs new work. That's always been the history of [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3478.54s)]
*  Technological progress and one of the things you're already seeing is there's a whole bunch of new ai companies [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3485.64s)]
*  That are exploiting this technology and they need to hire people so I basically agree with freeberg that you will [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3490.54s)]
*  Elevate people's work by automating away the less interesting parts of people's jobs [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3496.46s)]
*  And then creating more productivity and more opportunity by the way just to use your just use your example sacks [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3501.42s)]
*  So imagine if all the level one support people [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3507.02s)]
*  Some chunk of them can now do level two support and so the customers are going to get greater hands-on care [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3510.06s)]
*  More customers will get access to a higher level of service the organization can afford to do that [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3515.82s)]
*  They'll be more competitive in the marketplace because customers feel better taken care of [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3520.78s)]
*  I just think that's how the organizations get leveled up as new technology kind of shows up like this [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3525.66s)]
*  That's a great point and then those folks can have a much deeper level of interaction [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3530.7000000000003s)]
*  With their customers than they are today [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3534.7000000000003s)]
*  But answering basic questions more complex and then people might get better at the software and they might discover new features [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3536.94s)]
*  That you might be able to redeploy those people if you look at coffee like [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3542.86s)]
*  I don't know. Was it 40 years ago? You went to order a cup of coffee was decaf or [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3546.6200000000003s)]
*  Regular coffee milk and sugar. No, you're like those are your four choices [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3551.02s)]
*  And and now you go order coffee [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3554.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if you guys have used the starbucks app or the you know [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3556.7000000000003s)]
*  I just had the sweetgreen ceo on the pod and [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3559.6600000000003s)]
*  Man that you can the fidelity and the and the nuance of what you want to order is absurd [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3562.46s)]
*  Jamal, where do you think this is all heading because there is the issue of displacement how people how quickly people can read be redeployed [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3567.66s)]
*  and if we're seeing in year two [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3575.34s)]
*  Customer support and developers getting 10x. What other categories do you think we're going to see fall next? I think the truth is that [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3577.66s)]
*  As you said the real world applicability to ai was not last year. So I think we're really in the first [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3585.2599999999998s)]
*  Five or six weeks of the first year [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3591.98s)]
*  So you consider that year zero that's year zero that was sort of like the you know [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3595.34s)]
*  Where everybody was running around building toy apps group of concept [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3599.66s)]
*  This is one of the first few times where you're seeing something in production where there's measurable economic value [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3603.18s)]
*  And the important thing to note about that is that it's not just what it means for clarna [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3608.7s)]
*  But what it means for everybody else? So if you look at everybody else, for example, here's teleperformance, which is a french company that runs call centers [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3612.54s)]
*  They lost 1.7 billion dollars of market cap when that tweak went out [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3621.18s)]
*  About 20 of their market cap. So this is this is the real practical implication. Yes clarna replaced 700 people [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3625.8199999999997s)]
*  And they saved 40 million of op ex but teleport for months [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3633.3399999999997s)]
*  While they were just doing their everyday work lost 1.8 billion of their market cap at the exact same moment [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3638.22s)]
*  and so [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3644.9399999999996s)]
*  What does it mean? [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3646.3799999999997s)]
*  I think that what clarna should do is open source what they've built [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3648.7000000000003s)]
*  and [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3653.5s)]
*  the reason is that [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3654.38s)]
*  you want to give companies like teleport for months [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3656.06s)]
*  a chance to [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3659.82s)]
*  Retool themselves with the best possible technology so they they can actually preserve as many of the jobs as possible [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3662.2200000000003s)]
*  Because at the limit if every single company is able to implement something that is as economically efficient as what clarna did [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3668.86s)]
*  Teleperformance doesn't exist and there's 10 billion dollars and [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3675.66s)]
*  335 000 employees that will not have a job. Yep [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3680.36s)]
*  And so for clarna the reason to open source it is twofold one is [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3683.74s)]
*  They don't lose anything because you will still need to train it on your own data. And so there's no disadvantage that clarna [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3688.22s)]
*  Will have right they're just saying look I built this on top of gpt. Here's what it looks like [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3695.26s)]
*  And that production code can be used by anybody else go for it, but it has to run on your own data [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3700.78s)]
*  That's a very reasonable thing. So I think it has the benefit of both a setting a technical pace [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3705.26s)]
*  That can help them attract better employees and more highly qualified people who find [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3711.02s)]
*  the scope of work even more interesting and b [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3715.34s)]
*  I think it's on the right side of history with all this ai stuff where [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3718.86s)]
*  It's allowing everybody to sort of benefit in a way that is the least destructive [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3722.46s)]
*  But I just wanted to show you that the destruction was quite quick and it was pretty severe [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3726.62s)]
*  And if two or three other big companies launch these kinds of tweets after real measurable results [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3731.1s)]
*  Teleperformance will be a one billion dollar company short in short order. There's a third reason [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3737.1s)]
*  I think it's a brilliant idea for clarna to open source [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3740.9399999999996s)]
*  this this tool because it's not their business right this is something they did as a [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3744.14s)]
*  As a productivity improvement they get the benefit back to them of the community working to advance that technology [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3748.8599999999997s)]
*  So they don't have to put more engineers like advancing the ball on their customer support ai [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3754.8599999999997s)]
*  Totally, they can just re re merge in the changes that the open source community comes up with [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3759.58s)]
*  Yeah, and since they're not in the business of selling ai directly. There's no reason not to do it like jamas said [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3764.46s)]
*  So I think it's kind of brilliant. Yeah, this is meta strategy by the way [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3769.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean so I was going to say they should be building this on meta is open source products and apple's open source products, right? [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3773.1800000000003s)]
*  Sax yeah [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3778.14s)]
*  Well, so what what meta said what zuck said on the last meta call is the reason we open source everything is because we don't [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3779.1800000000003s)]
*  Directly sell ai we create products that ai makes better [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3785.58s)]
*  So by open sourcing this we allow the community to advance the ball and we get to reincorporate those changes [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3790.38s)]
*  So it's a very smart strategy for companies [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3796.54s)]
*  That aren't directly selling the ai now, you know if you're if you're like brett taylor's new company sierra [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3799.1s)]
*  Obviously, you're not going to open source it because your whole business model is to create a proprietary solution [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3804.78s)]
*  Yeah, but then to chamac's mock, you know 80 90 whatever he was talking about [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3810.38s)]
*  With his you know incubator concept and you know these things it's a company. It's a company. Okay [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3814.94s)]
*  Is it 80 90 or 90 80? I'm sorry 80 90 80 90 [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3821.18s)]
*  Is there a third word that comes off of it? You're just gonna call it 80 90 just 80 got it [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3824.8599999999997s)]
*  Okay, 80 percent of the features at a 90 percent discount [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3828.54s)]
*  So back to that like what does this mean if these things are getting to freeburg your point about the pace? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3831.2599999999998s)]
*  And the pace of these things is it going to improve 10 percent a year or 10 percent a month? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3837.3399999999997s)]
*  It was improving 10 percent a month [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3841.2599999999998s)]
*  We're going to get to 98 percent of queries done this year [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3843.1s)]
*  If it's doing 10 percent a year, okay [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3846.7799999999997s)]
*  We're going to get to 99 or 98 percent of queries in four years [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3848.06s)]
*  In other words, this is happening folks and it's happening at a blistering pace [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3851.5s)]
*  By the way, think of it's so not just teleperformance, which is a it was a 10 billion dollar now a 7.5 [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3855.8199999999997s)]
*  8 billion dollar usd company [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3862.38s)]
*  But think about zendesk right zendesk was a I think a 8 to 10 billion dollar 10 billion [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3864.86s)]
*  Private yeah, yeah, it was a 10 billion dollar take private in the hands of pe [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3869.58s)]
*  The entire zendesk workflow could be replaced by a handful of these open source agents [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3874.86s)]
*  Where all of a sudden people can eliminate a lot of opax [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3879.82s)]
*  I think the I think the thing to keep in mind here is where the world is going [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3883.02s)]
*  Has always been to try to lower cost [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3887.5s)]
*  and [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3890.38s)]
*  the original [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3891.26s)]
*  foundational principle of sas was that there's these line items in on-prem software that are just extremely expensive over time [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3892.68s)]
*  Very hard to justify right and so when people moved to sas from on-prem [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3899.9s)]
*  They were looking for cost savings. That was the initial thing now [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3904.3s)]
*  It's actually not cheaper anymore, but it's much more feature rich. So you get a lot more value in sas, etc, etc [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3907.98s)]
*  But the point of these ai agents and bots and workflows is that it'll reintroduce the concept of cash [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3914.3s)]
*  Of cost savings of this idea that you can have cheaper faster and better [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3921.02s)]
*  And the more that that stuff is open source my gosh [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3926.06s)]
*  I think it just makes it very hard for companies that have point products to survive [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3928.94s)]
*  you know, we I was talking to a friend of mine josh more who was the city head of [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3933.8199999999997s)]
*  Uber in new york and he launched his own note-taking app [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3940.06s)]
*  He's writing it himself and he's obsessed with this concept of building a billion dollar a unicorn company with one employee [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3942.7s)]
*  And this is something that a lot of people have been talking about my friend phil caplan from dishtro kid [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3948.7s)]
*  Built a very large business in dishtro kid a unicorn with a very like I think low single digit number of people [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3953.42s)]
*  This could be the future of you know efficiency you you could build if you catch fire with a really hot company that gets a million [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3959.1000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely the future it's absolutely the future and then if you think about our jobs in terms of capital allocation [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3965.26s)]
*  Well, how much capital does that founder need do they need to dilute 10 20 30? [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3970.46s)]
*  They're not going to need to dilute 60 70 80 [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3974.7000000000003s)]
*  A one-person company should be able to spend less than a few hundred grand to get to product market fit in the next few years [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3977.0200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that's that's kind of what we're seeing just to [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3982.86s)]
*  Go back to your question [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3986.14s)]
*  Jake how like where does this go next? Yeah, listen, I think it's it's it's really interesting to speculate about that [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3987.66s)]
*  So what claurena seems to be talking about are email based customer support cases. I think where this is going to go next is to phone [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=3993.58s)]
*  100 percent and these call centers use what are called ivr's these interactive voice response systems, but they're very rigid [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4002.06s)]
*  It's a lot of pre-recorded messages and it says push one if your problem is this push two if your problem is this [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4009.1s)]
*  Everyone hates those things. Yeah [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4014.38s)]
*  I think where it goes next is you'll call up the call center and you'll get a a voice that sounds like a human [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4016.62s)]
*  Just talk to you. Yeah, and you won't even necessarily realize that you're talking to an ai because they're already [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4022.46s)]
*  These ai companies that can do generative voices any language any accent. Oh and they're fast now [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4027.66s)]
*  And they're fine, yeah, that's the language think about that just localizing them across the globe [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4034.14s)]
*  You know you want to launch your product in japan, by the way, did you guys see there was a meta demo? [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4038.8599999999997s)]
*  Which I thought was really cool, which was it was run on? [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4043.02s)]
*  Llama 70b but it was a real-time translation tool where the person was speaking in hokkien Chinese and the and the other person was speaking [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4046.3799999999997s)]
*  In english and they were able to understand each other but sax to your point when that person calls for example b of a [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4053.66s)]
*  now [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4060.54s)]
*  Spanish is not a language. It's actually many dialects and many many many different accents, right? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4061.5s)]
*  Depending on which country you're from like the accent that you hear [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4067.34s)]
*  In spain is totally different than the accent in el salvador the accent in chile or argentina [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4070.62s)]
*  And so wouldn't it be amazing where you? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4075.58s)]
*  You call your b of a app [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4077.82s)]
*  It picks up your accent and your tonality and it responds with the person of that exact same accent and tonality [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4079.82s)]
*  That is incredible. Well, i'll take it to another level you call it recognizes your number [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4085.98s)]
*  It knows what you're doing in the software. It knows the problem you've had it knows the last three times you called [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4091.2599999999998s)]
*  And how long you've been using the software and it anticipates like okay [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4096.46s)]
*  I know this person has a windows machine and it's you know, still five years old and it's like are you still using that same? [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4099.9s)]
*  Five-year-old windows machine. Yeah, we know it's a bug with you know windows whatever [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4105.42s)]
*  You should probably upgrade. I mean it's going to know the entire context of this [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4110.46s)]
*  And so it's going to just get it can be more efficient than a human could ever be [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4113.26s)]
*  The best customer support interaction I had [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4117.9s)]

*  Buyer pool does not exist in the reddit mods except maybe the reddit participants [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4470.7s)]
*  What they're doing. Yeah, I think they'll buy the uh, I think they'll buy after the lockup comes up [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4475.98s)]
*  But let's just get started here. I think [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4481.0199999999995s)]
*  you [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4484.62s)]
*  looked at the [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4485.58s)]
*  S1 a little bit [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4487.74s)]
*  Freberg and you had asked us to you'd ask me to put on a docket because you were you were digging into it anything [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4489.34s)]
*  Stick out to you or thoughts on [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4493.66s)]
*  the business overall [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4496.0599999999995s)]
*  No, I mean I wasn't [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4497.82s)]
*  Pulling I just asked if you guys had read it. Um, right. Hey, um, I [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4499.26s)]
*  I think [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4504.9400000000005s)]
*  I made a funny joke [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4506.06s)]
*  Reddit accidently [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4508.7s)]
*  I [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4510.860000000001s)]
*  I'll let you guys go on for a minute. Go ahead [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4511.900000000001s)]
*  Tell me when you're ready [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4514.54s)]
*  It was a good pun too bad it was accidental [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4517.74s)]
*  No, it was it was intentional i'll give you credit it was intentional give it to you [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4522.22s)]
*  so I think the the thing about reddit if you could pull up the chart with the [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4525.34s)]
*  Quarterly average daily active user data. This was a business that the last couple of years [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4529.5s)]
*  Everyone was like had flatlined because it was only growing five percent a year [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4534.06s)]
*  In terms of usage and then all of a sudden in the last two quarters [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4539.1s)]
*  So starting in late summer early fall of 23, so just six months ago [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4543.66s)]
*  The usage started to climb pretty significantly [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4548.38s)]
*  Growing 15 and most in the most recent quarter 27 percent [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4551.26s)]
*  Year over year absent that growth story. It's a really challenged business because a business without much growth [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4555.1s)]
*  Gets value typically on a multiple of the cash flow that they're generating [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4561.98s)]
*  And you know, there's less upside and all this kind of optionality goes away. That's kind of a key point [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4565.82s)]
*  I I don't know. I think like for you to make an investment at a five billion dollar valuation here [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4570.38s)]
*  You've really got to believe that the growth continues at this rate [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4574.94s)]
*  And it doesn't revert back to the mean growth rate of the last couple of years [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4578.22s)]
*  Of basically five percent, which is roughly flatlined [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4582.219999999999s)]
*  The other challenge they have is that their arpo is only in that kind of three dollar range [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4585.0199999999995s)]
*  Which is like less than 10 percent of where facebook is at [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4589.099999999999s)]
*  And the data that facebook collects on their users gives them the ability to do much better targeting [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4592.54s)]
*  On ads and therefore monetize their audience much better than reddit has been able to do to the order of over 10x [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4598.139999999999s)]
*  And then if you look at the arpu number how much they've been able to grow that metric [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4604.38s)]
*  It's also, you know been a little bit flatlined [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4608.219999999999s)]
*  So this business I think is a real question mark [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4611.26s)]
*  I mean you could argue it's probably worth in the best best case in the two to three billion dollar [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4614.22s)]
*  kind of valuation range [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4618.54s)]
*  And then you have to believe the bull case that the growth continues or accelerates from here [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4620.38s)]
*  And they have a plan to address the arpu problem. They have other paths for monetizing their audience [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4625.34s)]
*  Than what they're kind of doing [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4631.099999999999s)]
*  Today, what do you guys think this thing's worth? [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4633.099999999999s)]
*  Do you buy it if it goes out at three billion or five billion? I think the first question [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4635.5s)]
*  Which you nailed that a buy side investor [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4639.900000000001s)]
*  Will ask is what happened in the last two quarters that was different than the last 15 quarters [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4645.74s)]
*  That's going to be a very important question and I think they're going to have to have a very buttoned up answer for that [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4652.3s)]
*  right, and if they can point to [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4657.26s)]
*  very specific repeatable things [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4659.82s)]
*  I think that'll be good the thing that they [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4661.9800000000005s)]
*  This ipo if it goes off in the next four weeks [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4665.900000000001s)]
*  They won't have to wait, but if it doesn't get off in the next four weeks, they'll have to update the s1 probably with q1 [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4669.9800000000005s)]
*  And so you'll see whether this thing is a trend or whether it was a one-time thing. Do you know what it is? [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4677.900000000001s)]
*  Well, the growth in the logged out is probably largely because typically if you use it on a phone [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4683.66s)]
*  It tries to force you to [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4691.26s)]
*  use the app [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4693.74s)]
*  right so that you can be in this logged in experience and [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4695.1s)]
*  If you just turn that off you can get a lot more logged out because reddit gets tremendous rank authority from google [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4699.02s)]
*  So if you just if you just turn that off [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4705.820000000001s)]
*  I think that you'll have a lot of logged out customers and that will grow very quickly [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4707.580000000001s)]
*  And so maybe it's a decision that they'd rather have the top line number grow [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4711.18s)]
*  Than have logged in users grow but the logged in user growth has still been pretty healthy. It's basically doubled in the last three years. So [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4715.18s)]
*  But to your point freeberg if they said or our business is really only these [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4722.46s)]
*  30 odd million logged in users, it would be worth a lot less than saying 75 million [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4727.02s)]
*  I think it's I think you're right. It's kind of like in the [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4732.860000000001s)]
*  mid [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4735.900000000001s)]
*  you know kind of [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4737.02s)]
*  234 billion dollarish range the the big problem is the arpu because these are not users [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4738.780000000001s)]
*  that represent sort of [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4745.26s)]
*  Facebook's bread and butter [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4747.34s)]
*  kind of a forty dollar arpu lives in a good suburb in [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4749.34s)]
*  The united states and is monetized like crazy [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4753.820000000001s)]
*  I just don't think that's what these users are [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4758.14s)]
*  But you can see that as a challenge or an opportunity because if there are poos only 10% of facebook [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4760.700000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of headroom there to grow it if those users become [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4766.38s)]
*  Economically more valuable arpu is actually down two percent year-over-year sex the issue with this user base is they're incredibly sophisticated internet users [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4770.6s)]
*  who don't click on ads and are kind of anti-ads as opposed to [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4779.1s)]
*  You know the the general population on a facebook or a generic service and it's anonymous [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4783.34s)]
*  So you don't know who the user is which is how facebook has such incredible demographic targeting capabilities. There's been a lot of [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4788.22s)]
*  Conspiracy theories long con theories that came up sax that we were talking about on group chat [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4795.0s)]
*  Maybe you could summarize this [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4801.34s)]
*  long [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4803.66s)]
*  Game that was played by sam altman and me [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4805.34s)]
*  allegedly [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4808.280000000001s)]
*  founders of reddit to wrestle control of reddit back from [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4809.42s)]
*  Their free risk corporate owner kundinest [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4813.58s)]
*  Well, this was a post by yishan who was a former ceo of reddit that was published back in I think 2015 [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4816.54s)]
*  And he kind of lays out [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4823.34s)]
*  What I think happened or I mean he says at the end just kidding, but if he's a former ceo describing these events [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4825.66s)]
*  He must be describing something. He knows about I would just think [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4832.780000000001s)]
*  But in any event what happened is that reddit was sold for only about 10 million dollars a year after it launched [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4837.42s)]
*  So like really really small and I think that it kept growing and the founders realized maybe they made a mistake or [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4843.0199999999995s)]
*  That this was actually a bigger property [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4849.98s)]
*  and so they started scheming on how to get kundinest to spin it back out and [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4852.78s)]
*  so yishan lays out the steps they went through they [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4857.58s)]
*  recruited [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4861.32s)]
*  A ceo who they kind of pre-agreed on then they had that ceo demand options [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4863.0199999999995s)]
*  Specifically in reddit from kundinest which meant that kundinest had to create a separate cap table for it [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4868.7s)]
*  And then once they had a separate cap table as a subsidiary of kundinest [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4876.46s)]
*  Then they could sort of pressure to have like an outside investor bought in [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4880.7s)]
*  For the expertise that just happened to be sam altman [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4884.54s)]
*  And his fund [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4887.9s)]
*  And you know eventually like step by step they worked it to the point where they got kundinest to spin off the company [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4889.82s)]
*  And I guess this plan worked now [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4895.74s)]
*  It should be said that the largest shareholder in reddit according to the s1 is kundinest or kundinest parent company [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4898.3s)]
*  So no one's going to benefit more [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4905.58s)]
*  From this plan if you want to scheme if you want to call it that than kundinest it was a smart [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4907.9s)]
*  thing for them to do to spin out [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4913.0199999999995s)]
*  Reddit to allow the employees to have options and then I would say to bring back the founder steve huffman as [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4915.98s)]
*  Huffman as ceo several years ago, so yeah, he's great. It worked out for everybody, you know [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4922.139999999999s)]
*  Who knows if it was all premeditated so they own 30 percent and it goes out for five billion and they got 1.5 billion [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4926.7s)]
*  They paid 10 million for it. So [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4934.86s)]
*  That's like a web 250x 2.0. It's 1.0 2.0. No, it's two is it launched in 2005 [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4938.54s)]
*  Yeah, it was at 2.0 [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4944.46s)]
*  Same time as like weblogs inc and delicious and flickr and all that that whole cohort [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4945.66s)]
*  of little web apps that used ajax and other things to [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4951.42s)]
*  You know, the web was just getting faster [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4955.74s)]
*  And there were a lot of users [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4958.7s)]
*  Well, anyway, congratulations to the team [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4960.38s)]
*  It was smart for kundinest to do the spin out and give up 70 percent in order for [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4962.22s)]
*  To have 30 percent of what's going to be a multi-billion dollar ipo great outcome for everybody [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4967.26s)]
*  All right issue five apple doesn't have a fast car project titan is dba dead before arrival [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Am0vMW3fA0&t=4971.580000000001s)]
