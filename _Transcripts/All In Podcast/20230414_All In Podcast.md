# E124 AutoGPT's massive potential and risk, AI regulation, Bob LeeSF update
**All In Podcast:** [April 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk)
*  Welcome to episode 124 of the All In Podcast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=0.0s)]
*  My understanding is there's gonna be [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4.08s)]
*  a bunch of global fan meetups for episode 125. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5.92s)]
*  If you go to Twitter and you search for all in fan meetups, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=9.96s)]
*  you might be able to find the link. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=13.52s)]
*  But just to be clear, we're not, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=14.64s)]
*  they're not official all in. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=15.68s)]
*  They're fans, it's self-organized, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=17.6s)]
*  which is pretty mind blowing, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=19.92s)]
*  but we can't vouch for any particular organization, right? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Nobody knows what's gonna happen at these things. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=24.68s)]
*  You could get robbed, it could be a setup. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=26.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=29.400000000000002s)]
*  But I retweeted it anyway, because there are 31 cities [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=30.6s)]
*  where you lunatics are getting together [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=33.76s)]
*  to celebrate the world's number one [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=35.96s)]
*  business technology podcast. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=38.24s)]
*  It is pretty crazy. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=40.64s)]
*  You know what this reminds me of is in the early 90s, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=41.68s)]
*  when Rush Limbaugh became a phenomenon, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=45.0s)]
*  there used to be these things called rush rooms, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  where like restaurants and bars would literally broadcast [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=49.6s)]
*  Rush over their speakers during, I don't know, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=53.24s)]
*  like for the morning through lunch broadcast. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=56.24s)]
*  And people would go to these rush rooms and listen together. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=58.44s)]
*  What was it like, Sax, when you were about 16, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=61.16s)]
*  17 years old at the time? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=63.12s)]
*  What was it like when you hosted this? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=64.52s)]
*  It was a phenomenon, but I mean, it's kind of crazy. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=65.88s)]
*  We've got like a phenomenon going here [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=68.2s)]
*  where people are self-organizing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=69.75999999999999s)]
*  You've said phenomenon three times. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=72.2s)]
*  Instead of phenomenon, he said phenomenon. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=74.16s)]
*  Phenomenal. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=77.16s)]
*  Why is Sax in a good mood, Shema? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=78.32s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=79.75999999999999s)]
*  There's a specific secret toe tap [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=80.6s)]
*  that you do under the bathroom stalls [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=82.28s)]
*  when you go to a rush room. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  Oh, you're already off the rails. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=85.28s)]
*  I think you're getting confused about a different event you went to. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=89.52s)]
*  Let your winners ride. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=92.28s)]
*  Rain Man David's out. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=97.52s)]
*  I'm going all in. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=98.8s)]
*  And as said, we open source it to the fans, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=101.8s)]
*  and they've just gone crazy with it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=103.8s)]
*  Love you, S.I.D.S. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=105.8s)]
*  Queen of Kenwa. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=106.8s)]
*  I'm going all in. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=107.8s)]
*  There's a lot of actual news in the world, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=109.8s)]
*  and generative AI is taking over the dialogue, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=112.2s)]
*  and it's moving at a pace that none of us have ever seen [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=116.16s)]
*  in the technology industry. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=120.68s)]
*  I think we'd all agree. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=121.68s)]
*  The number of companies releasing product [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=122.92s)]
*  and the compounding effect of this technology is phenomenal. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=126.48s)]
*  I think we would all agree. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  A product came out this week called Auto GPT, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=133.04s)]
*  and people are losing their mind over it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=138.08s)]
*  Basically, what this does is it lets different GPTs talk to each other, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=141.08s)]
*  and so you can have agents working in the background, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=148.08s)]
*  and we've talked about this on previous podcasts, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  but they could be talking to each other essentially, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=153.4s)]
*  and then completing tasks without much intervention. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=157.32000000000002s)]
*  So if, let's say, you had a sales team, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=160.08s)]
*  and you said to the sales team, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=162.68s)]
*  hey, look for leads that have these characteristics [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=165.16000000000003s)]
*  for our sales software, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  put them into our database, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=170.56s)]
*  find out if they're already in the database, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=172.28s)]
*  alert a salesperson to it, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=174.12s)]
*  compose a message based on that person's profile, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=175.44s)]
*  on LinkedIn or Twitter or wherever, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=177.8s)]
*  and then compose an email, send it to them. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  If they reply, offer them to do a demo, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=181.64000000000001s)]
*  and then put that demo on the calendar of the salesperson, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=184.12s)]
*  thus eliminating a bunch of jobs, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  and you could run these, what would essentially be, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  Cron jobs in the background forever, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=190.68s)]
*  and they could interact with other LLMs in real time. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=193.88s)]
*  Sax, I've just gave about one example here, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=197.04s)]
*  but when you see this happening, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=199.04s)]
*  give us your perspective on what this tipping point means. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=200.64s)]
*  Let me take a shot at explaining it [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=204.36s)]
*  in a slightly different way. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=206.36s)]
*  Not that your explanation was wrong, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=208.16s)]
*  but I just think that maybe explain it [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=209.48s)]
*  in terms of something more tangible. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=211.52s)]
*  So I had a friend who's a developer [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=214.16s)]
*  who's been playing with Auto GPT. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=216.64s)]
*  By the way, so you can see it's on GitHub, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=219.44s)]
*  it's kind of an open source project. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=221.16s)]
*  It was sort of a hobby project, it looks like, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=222.52s)]
*  that somebody put up there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=224.24s)]
*  It's been out for about two weeks. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=226.0s)]
*  It's already got 45,000 stars on GitHub, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=227.88s)]
*  which is a huge number. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=230.6s)]
*  Explain what GitHub is for the audience. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=231.84s)]
*  It's just a code repository, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=233.84s)]
*  and you can create repos of code for open source projects. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=235.2s)]
*  That's where all the developers check in their code. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=238.16s)]
*  So for open source projects like this, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=240.32s)]
*  anyone can go see it and play with it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=242.44s)]
*  It's like Pornhub, but for developers. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=244.12s)]
*  It would be more like amateur Pornhub, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=247.2s)]
*  because you're contributing your scenes, as it were, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=249.16s)]
*  your code is. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=251.72s)]
*  Yes, continue. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=252.56s)]
*  This thing has a ton of stars, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=253.56s)]
*  and apparently just last night, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=256.32s)]
*  I got another 10,000 stars overnight. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=257.92s)]
*  This thing is like exploding in terms of popularity. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=259.52s)]
*  But in any event, what you do is you give it an assignment. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=262.76s)]
*  And what Auto GPT can do that's different [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=265.48s)]
*  is it can string together prompts. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=269.36s)]
*  So if you go to chat GPT, you prompt it one at a time. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=271.56s)]
*  And what the human does is you get your answer, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=274.68s)]
*  and then you think of your next prompt, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=276.32s)]
*  and then you kind of go from there, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=277.76s)]
*  and you end up in a long conversation [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=278.92s)]
*  that gets you to where you want to go. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=280.76s)]
*  So the question is, what if the AI [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=284.08s)]
*  could basically prompt itself, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=285.8s)]
*  then you've got the basis for autonomy. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=288.0s)]
*  And that's what this project is designed to do. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=290.92s)]
*  So what you'll do is, what my friend did is he said, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=293.28000000000003s)]
*  okay, you're an event planner AI. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  And what I would like you to do is plan a trip for me [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=299.84000000000003s)]
*  for a wine tasting in Healdsburg this weekend. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=303.68s)]
*  And I want you to find the best place I should go, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=307.84000000000003s)]
*  and it's got to be kid friendly, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  not everyone's going to drink, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=311.56s)]
*  and I'd like to be able to have other people there. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=312.64s)]
*  And so I'd like you to plan this for me. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=315.12s)]
*  And so what Auto GPT did is it broke that down [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=317.4s)]
*  into a task list. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=320.84s)]
*  And every time it completed a task, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=322.52s)]
*  it would add a new task to the bottom of that list. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  And so the output of this is that it searched [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=328.2s)]
*  a bunch of different wine tasting venues. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=331.32s)]
*  It found a venue that had a bocce ball and lawn area [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=333.84s)]
*  for kids. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=336.91999999999996s)]
*  It came up with a schedule. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=337.84s)]
*  It created a budget. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=339.96s)]
*  It created a checklist for an event planner. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=341.52s)]
*  It did all these things. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=344.68s)]
*  My friend says he's actually gonna book the venue [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=345.59999999999997s)]
*  this weekend and use it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=347.14s)]
*  So we're going beyond the ability just for a human [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=348.79999999999995s)]
*  to just prompt the AI. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=352.52s)]
*  Where now the AI can take on complicated tasks. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=353.91999999999996s)]
*  And again, it can recursively update its task list [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=358.32s)]
*  based on what it learns from its own previous prompt. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=361.03999999999996s)]
*  So what you're seeing now is the basis [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  for a personal digital assistant. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=366.12s)]
*  This is really where it's all headed [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  is that you can just tell the AI to do something [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=370.16s)]
*  for you pretty complicated and it will be able to do it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=372.72s)]
*  It will be able to create its own task list [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=375.76000000000005s)]
*  and get the job done in quite complicated jobs. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=377.72s)]
*  So that's why everyone's losing their shit over this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=381.76000000000005s)]
*  Freeberg, your thoughts on automating these tasks [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=383.8s)]
*  and having them run and add tasks to the list. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=387.24s)]
*  This does seem like a sort of seminal moment in time [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=390.94000000000005s)]
*  that this is actually working. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=394.6s)]
*  I think we've been seeing seminal moments [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=397.16s)]
*  over the last couple of weeks and months, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=401.32000000000005s)]
*  kind of continuously. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=404.04s)]
*  Every time we chat about stuff or every day [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=405.72s)]
*  there's new releases that are paradigm shifting [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=408.52000000000004s)]
*  and kind of reveal new applications [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=411.86s)]
*  and perhaps concepts structurally [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=414.76000000000005s)]
*  that we didn't really have a good grasp of [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=417.16s)]
*  before some demonstration came across. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=420.64000000000004s)]
*  Chat GPT was kind of the seed of that [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=422.32000000000005s)]
*  and then all of this evolution since [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=424.24s)]
*  has really, I think, changed the landscape [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=427.44s)]
*  for really how we think about our interaction [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=429.42s)]
*  with the digital world and where the digital world can go [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=432.2s)]
*  and how it can interact with the physical world. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=435.44s)]
*  It's just really profound. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=437.36s)]
*  One of the interesting aspects that I think I saw [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=439.8s)]
*  with some of the applications of AutoGPT [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=442.28000000000003s)]
*  were these almost like autonomous characters [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=445.52s)]
*  in like a game simulation that could interact [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=449.76s)]
*  with each other or these autonomous characters [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=453.0s)]
*  that would speak back and forth to one another [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=454.76s)]
*  where each instance has its own kind of predefined role [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=457.48s)]
*  and then it explores some set of discovery [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=462.32s)]
*  or application or prompt back and forth with the other agent [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=464.68s)]
*  and that the kind of recursive outcomes [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=468.72s)]
*  with this agent to agent interaction model [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=470.98s)]
*  and perhaps multi-agent interaction model, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=473.2s)]
*  again reveals an entirely new paradigm for [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=476.6s)]
*  how things can be done simulation wise, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=479.28s)]
*  discovery wise, engagement wise, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=482.3s)]
*  where each agent can be a different character in a room [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=484.3s)]
*  and you can almost see how a team might resolve [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=488.5s)]
*  to create a new product collaboratively [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=490.78s)]
*  by telling each of those agents [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=492.9s)]
*  to have a different character background [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=495.06s)]
*  or different set of data or a different set of experiences [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=496.65999999999997s)]
*  or different set of personality traits [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=499.5s)]
*  and the evolution of that multi-agent system outputs [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=501.42s)]
*  something that's very novel that perhaps [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=505.34s)]
*  any of the agents operating independently [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=507.34s)]
*  were not able to kind of reveal themselves. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=508.96s)]
*  So again, like another kind of dimension of interaction [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=510.82s)]
*  with these models. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=514.66s)]
*  And it again, like every week [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=516.84s)]
*  it's a whole nother layer to the onion. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=518.58s)]
*  It's super exciting and compelling [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=521.26s)]
*  and the rate of change and the pace of kind of, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=522.98s)]
*  new paths being defined here really, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=526.62s)]
*  I think makes it difficult to catch up [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=530.48s)]
*  and particularly it highlights why it's gonna be so difficult [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=533.54s)]
*  I think for regulators to come in and try [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=535.8199999999999s)]
*  and set a set of standards and a set of rules at this stage [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=539.3s)]
*  because we don't even know what we have here yet. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=543.06s)]
*  And it's gonna be very hard [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=544.98s)]
*  to kind of put the genie back in the box. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=546.18s)]
*  Yeah, and you're also referring, I think, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=548.06s)]
*  to the Stanford and Google paper [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=550.9399999999999s)]
*  that was published this week. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=553.56s)]
*  They did a research paper [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=554.62s)]
*  where they created essentially the Sims, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=555.98s)]
*  if you remember that video game, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=557.9s)]
*  put a bunch of what you might consider NPCs, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=559.38s)]
*  non-playable characters, you know, the merchant [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=562.5s)]
*  or the whoever in a video game [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=564.98s)]
*  and they said, each of these agents should talk [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=569.5s)]
*  to each other, put them in a simulation. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=571.7800000000001s)]
*  One of them decided to have a birthday party. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=573.5400000000001s)]
*  They decided to invite other people [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=574.98s)]
*  and then they have memories. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=577.0600000000001s)]
*  And so then over time they would generate responses [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=578.1s)]
*  like I can't go to your birthday party, but happy birthday. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=581.1800000000001s)]
*  And then they would follow up with each player [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=584.6600000000001s)]
*  and seemingly emergent behaviors came out [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=587.3000000000001s)]
*  of this sort of simulation, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=590.7800000000001s)]
*  which of course now has everybody thinking, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=592.98s)]
*  well, of course we as humans, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=594.44s)]
*  and this is simulation theory, are living in a simulation. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=596.34s)]
*  We've all just been put into this. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=598.58s)]
*  Chamath, is what we're experiencing right now [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=600.7s)]
*  how impressive this technology is, or is it, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=603.9s)]
*  oh, wow, human cognition maybe we thought [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=608.72s)]
*  was incredibly special, but we can actually simulate [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=611.34s)]
*  a significant portion of what we do as humans. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=614.82s)]
*  So we're kind of taking the shine off of consciousness. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=617.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure it's that, but I would make two comments. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=620.62s)]
*  I think this is a really important week [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=622.9000000000001s)]
*  because it starts to show how fast the recursion is with AI. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=625.58s)]
*  So in other technologies and in other breakthroughs, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=632.38s)]
*  the recursive iterations took years, right? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=637.46s)]
*  If you think about how long did we wait [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=639.9000000000001s)]
*  from iPhone 1 to iPhone 2, it was a year, right? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=642.1s)]
*  We'd waited two years for the app store. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=646.4200000000001s)]
*  Everything was measured in years, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=649.62s)]
*  maybe things when they were really, really aggressive [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=651.4200000000001s)]
*  and really disruptive were measured in months, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=654.34s)]
*  except now these incredibly innovative breakthroughs [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=657.86s)]
*  are being measured in days and weeks. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=661.2800000000001s)]
*  That's incredibly profound. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=664.0600000000001s)]
*  And I think it has some really important implications [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=666.94s)]
*  to like the three big actors in this play, right? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=670.38s)]
*  So it has, I think, huge implications to these companies. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=673.0600000000001s)]
*  It's not clear to me how you start a company anymore. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=676.38s)]
*  I don't understand why you would have a 40 or 50 person [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=680.54s)]
*  company to try to get to an MVP. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=686.02s)]
*  I think you can do that with three or four people. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=689.62s)]
*  And that has huge implications then to the second actor [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=693.78s)]
*  in this play, which are the investors and venture capitalists [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=697.74s)]
*  that typically fund this stuff, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=700.9399999999999s)]
*  because all of our capital allocation models [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=702.14s)]
*  were always around writing 10 and 15 [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=705.2199999999999s)]
*  and 20 million dollar checks and a hundred million dollar [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=707.86s)]
*  checks, then $500 million checks into these businesses [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=709.86s)]
*  that absorbed tons of money. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=713.46s)]
*  But the reality is like, you know, you're looking at things [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=715.86s)]
*  like Mid Journey and others that can scale to enormous size [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=718.86s)]
*  with very little capital, many of which can now [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=722.7800000000001s)]
*  be bootstrapped. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=725.7s)]
*  So it takes really, really small amounts of money. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=727.3000000000001s)]
*  And so I think that's a huge implication. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=731.94s)]
*  So for me personally, I am looking at company formation, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=733.38s)]
*  being done in a totally different way. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=737.9000000000001s)]
*  And our capital allocation model is totally wrong size. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=740.0600000000001s)]
*  Look, fund four for me was $1 billion. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=742.82s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=745.58s)]
*  Nope. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=747.58s)]
*  For the next three or four years? [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=748.4200000000001s)]
*  No, the right number may actually be $50 million invested [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=749.24s)]
*  over the next four years. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=752.86s)]
*  I think the VC job is changing. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=754.1s)]
*  I think company startups are changing. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=755.6600000000001s)]
*  I want to remind you guys of one quick thing as a tangent. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=757.4200000000001s)]
*  I had this meeting with Andre Carpathy. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=761.3000000000001s)]
*  I talked about this on the pod where I said, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=762.74s)]
*  I challenged him. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=765.1800000000001s)]
*  I said, listen, the real goal should be to go [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=766.02s)]
*  and disrupt existing businesses using these tools, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=768.62s)]
*  cutting out all the sales and marketing, right? [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=771.74s)]
*  And just delivering something. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=774.36s)]
*  And I use the example of Stripe, disrupting Stripe [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=775.54s)]
*  by going to market with an equivalent product [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=778.5799999999999s)]
*  with one-tenth the number of employees at one-tenth the cost. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=780.4399999999999s)]
*  What's incredible is that this auto GPT is the answer [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=784.46s)]
*  to that exact problem. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=787.98s)]
*  Why? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=790.06s)]
*  Because now if you are a young industrious entrepreneur, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=790.96s)]
*  if you look at any bloated organization [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=794.88s)]
*  that's building enterprise class software, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=797.2s)]
*  you can string together a bunch of agents [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=799.98s)]
*  that will auto construct everything you need [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=803.44s)]
*  to build a much, much cheaper product [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=806.6800000000001s)]
*  that then you can deploy for other agents to consume. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=808.9200000000001s)]
*  So you don't even need a sales team anymore. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=812.2800000000001s)]
*  This is what I mean by this crazy recursion that's possible. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=814.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=817.5600000000001s)]
*  So I'm really curious to see how this actually affects [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=818.4000000000001s)]
*  like all of these, you know, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=821.0s)]
*  singular product companies. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=824.04s)]
*  I mean, it's a continuation Chamath of. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=825.1999999999999s)]
*  And then the last thing I just want to say [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=827.16s)]
*  is related to my tweet. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=828.3199999999999s)]
*  I think this is exactly the moment where we now have [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=830.34s)]
*  to have a real conversation about regulation. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=833.48s)]
*  And I think it has to happen. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=835.4s)]
*  Otherwise it's going to be a shit show. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=836.64s)]
*  Let's put a pin in that for a second, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=837.88s)]
*  but I want to get Sax's response to some of this. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=839.28s)]
*  So Sax, we saw this before. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=841.62s)]
*  It used to take two or $3 million to commercialize [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=843.84s)]
*  a web-based software product app. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=846.04s)]
*  Then it went down to 500K, then 250. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=848.0799999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=851.24s)]
*  but if you remember the hit game on your iPhone, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=852.36s)]
*  Flappy Birds, Flappy Birds, you know, was a phenomenon. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=855.88s)]
*  It, you know, hundreds of millions of people played [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=861.28s)]
*  this game over some period of time. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=863.2s)]
*  Somebody made it by talking to chat GPT-4 [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=866.0s)]
*  and mid journey in an hour. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=869.48s)]
*  So the perfect example, and listen, it's a game. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=871.6800000000001s)]
*  So it's something silly, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=874.08s)]
*  but I was talking to two developers this weekend [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=875.5600000000001s)]
*  and one of them was an okay developer. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=877.86s)]
*  And the other one was an actual 10X developer [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=880.36s)]
*  who's built, you know, very significant companies [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=882.4s)]
*  and they were coding together last week. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=884.92s)]
*  And because of how fast chat GPT and other services [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=887.2s)]
*  were writing code for them, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=890.74s)]
*  he looked over at her and said, you know, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=892.94s)]
*  you're basically a 10X developer now, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=895.36s)]
*  my superpower is gone. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  So where does this lead you to believe [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=900.76s)]
*  company formation is going to go? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=904.64s)]
*  Is this going to be, you know, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=906.28s)]
*  massively deflationary companies like Stripe [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=908.48s)]
*  are going to have a hundred competitors [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=910.76s)]
*  in a very short period of time, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=912.8000000000001s)]
*  or are we just going to go down the long tail of ideas [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=914.12s)]
*  and solve everything with software? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=917.04s)]
*  How is this going to play out in the startup space? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=919.9200000000001s)]
*  David Sacks. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=923.12s)]
*  Well, I think it's true that developers [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=924.84s)]
*  and especially junior developers get a lot more leverage [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=928.9200000000001s)]
*  on their time. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=932.36s)]
*  And so it is going to be easier for small teams [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=933.2s)]
*  to get to an MVP, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=935.5600000000001s)]
*  which is something they always should have done anyway [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=937.64s)]
*  with their seed round. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=939.3199999999999s)]
*  You shouldn't have needed, you know, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=940.48s)]
*  50 developers to build your V1. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=942.1999999999999s)]
*  It should be, you know, this is the founders really. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=945.4399999999999s)]
*  So that, that I think is already happening [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=948.6s)]
*  and that trend will continue. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=952.1999999999999s)]
*  I think we're still a ways away from startups [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=953.68s)]
*  being able to replace entire teams of people. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=958.4s)]
*  I just, you know, I think right now we're at the phase of this. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=960.3199999999999s)]
*  Final ways, months, years, decades. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=963.88s)]
*  Well, it's in the years, I think for sure. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=966.88s)]
*  We don't know how many years. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=968.72s)]
*  And the reason I say that it's just very hard to replace, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=970.44s)]
*  you know, a hundred percent of what any [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=975.0s)]
*  of these particular job functions do. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=977.52s)]
*  A hundred percent of what a sales rep does, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=979.52s)]
*  a hundred percent of what a marketing rep does, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=981.12s)]
*  or even what a coder does. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=983.32s)]
*  So right now I think we're still at the phase of this [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=984.88s)]
*  where it's a tool that gives a human leverage. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=987.24s)]
*  And I think we're still a ways away from the, you know, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=991.32s)]
*  human being completely out of the loop. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=994.2800000000001s)]
*  I think right now I see it mostly as a force for good, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=995.88s)]
*  as opposed to something that's creating [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1000.76s)]
*  a ton of dislocation. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1003.12s)]
*  Friedberg, your thoughts. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1004.8s)]
*  If we follow the trend line, you know, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1006.28s)]
*  to make that video game that you shared took probably [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1008.4399999999999s)]
*  a few hundred human years, then a few dozen human years, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1011.36s)]
*  then, you know, with other toolkits coming out, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1014.84s)]
*  maybe a few human months, and now this person did it [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1018.6s)]
*  in one human day using this tooling. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1021.24s)]
*  So if you think about the implication for that, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1024.12s)]
*  I mentioned this probably last year, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1026.9599999999998s)]
*  I really do believe that at some point, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1029.4399999999998s)]
*  the whole concept of publishers and publishing [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1031.6399999999999s)]
*  maybe goes away. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1034.1599999999999s)]
*  Where, you know, much like we saw so much of the content [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1035.52s)]
*  on the internet today being user generated, you know, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1037.9199999999998s)]
*  most of the content is made by individuals [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1040.12s)]
*  posted on YouTube or Twitter. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1042.32s)]
*  That's most of what we consume nowadays, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1043.6399999999999s)]
*  or Instagram or TikTok in terms of video content. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1045.6799999999998s)]
*  We could see the same in terms of software itself, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1049.4799999999998s)]
*  where you no longer need a software startup [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1054.76s)]
*  or a software company to render or generate a set of tools [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1056.16s)]
*  for a particular user, but that the user may be able [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1060.0800000000002s)]
*  to define to their agent, their AI agent, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1063.0800000000002s)]
*  the set of tools that they would individually like to use [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1066.6000000000001s)]
*  or to create for them to do something interesting. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1069.3200000000002s)]
*  And so the idea of buying or subscribing to software [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1071.8400000000001s)]
*  or even buying or subscribing to a video game [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1075.48s)]
*  or to a movie or to some other form of content [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1078.16s)]
*  starts to diminish as the leverage goes up [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1081.48s)]
*  with these tools, the accessibility goes up. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1084.88s)]
*  You no longer need a computer engineering degree [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1086.88s)]
*  or computer science degree to be able to harness them [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1088.72s)]
*  or use them. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1091.3600000000001s)]
*  And individuals may be able to speak in simple [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1092.28s)]
*  and plain English that they would like a book [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1094.3600000000001s)]
*  or a movie that looks and feels like the following [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1096.8s)]
*  or a video game that feels like the following. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1099.8s)]
*  And so when I open up my iPhone, maybe it's not a screen [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1102.48s)]
*  with dozens of video games, but it's one interface. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1105.76s)]
*  And the interface says, what do you feel like playing today? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1108.24s)]
*  And then I can very clearly and succinctly state [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1111.1599999999999s)]
*  what I feel like playing and it can render that game, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1112.24s)]
*  render the code, render the engine, render the graphics [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1114.04s)]
*  and everything on the fly for me. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1117.36s)]
*  And I can use that. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1118.84s)]
*  And so, I kind of think about this as being a bit [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1120.0s)]
*  of a leveling up that the idea that all technology, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1122.12s)]
*  again, starts central and moves to kind of the edge [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1125.4399999999998s)]
*  of the network over time, that may be what's going on [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1127.32s)]
*  with computer programming itself now, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1130.6s)]
*  where the toolkit to actually use computers [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1132.8s)]
*  to generate stuff for us is no longer a toolkit [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1136.36s)]
*  that's harnessed and controlled and utilized [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1139.68s)]
*  by a set of centralized publishers, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1142.0s)]
*  but it becomes distributed and used at the edge [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1144.0s)]
*  of the network by users like anyone. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1145.8400000000001s)]
*  And then the edge of the network technology [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1148.3200000000002s)]
*  can render the software for you. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1150.6000000000001s)]
*  And it really creates a profound change [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1152.52s)]
*  in the entire business landscape [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1154.28s)]
*  of software and the internet. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1156.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think it's really like, we're just starting [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1159.1200000000001s)]
*  to kind of have our heads unravel around this notion. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1162.24s)]
*  And we're sort of trying to link it to the old paradigm, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1165.52s)]
*  which is, oh, startups are gonna get cheaper [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1168.0s)]
*  at smaller teams, but it may be that you don't even [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1169.24s)]
*  need startups for a lot of the stuff anymore. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1171.2s)]
*  You don't even need teams and you don't even need companies [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1173.04s)]
*  to generate and render software to do stuff for you anymore. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1175.32s)]
*  Chamath, when we look at this, it's kind of a pattern [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1177.84s)]
*  of augmentation as we've been talking about here, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1181.76s)]
*  we're augmenting human intelligence, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1185.76s)]
*  then replacing this replication or this automation, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1188.56s)]
*  I guess might be a nice way to say it. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1193.6s)]
*  So it's augmentation, then automation, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1194.76s)]
*  and then perhaps deprecation. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1197.6s)]
*  Where do you sit on this? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1200.04s)]
*  It seems like Sachs feels it's gonna take years [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1201.48s)]
*  and Freiburg thinks, hey, maybe startups and content are over. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1204.6799999999998s)]
*  Where do you sit on this augmentation, automation, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1207.7199999999998s)]
*  deprecation journey we're on? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1210.08s)]
*  I think that humans have judgment. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1212.28s)]
*  And I think it's gonna take decades for agents [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1214.04s)]
*  to replace good judgment. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1216.9599999999998s)]
*  And I think that's where we have some defensible ground. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1218.1599999999999s)]
*  And I'm gonna say something controversial. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1222.6s)]
*  I don't think developers anymore have good judgment. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1224.4s)]
*  Developers get to the answer or they don't get to the answer. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1228.24s)]
*  And that's what agents have done [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1231.2800000000002s)]
*  because the 10x engineer had better judgment [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1232.76s)]
*  than the 1x engineer. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1235.92s)]
*  But by making everybody a 10x engineer, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1237.96s)]
*  you're taking judgment away. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1239.88s)]
*  You're taking code paths that are now obvious [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1242.0s)]
*  and making it available to everybody. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1244.88s)]
*  It's effectively like what you did in chess. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1246.68s)]
*  An AI created a solver so everybody understood [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1249.1200000000001s)]
*  the most efficient path in every single spot [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1252.84s)]
*  to do the most EV positive thing, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1255.24s)]
*  the most expected value positive thing. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1257.9599999999998s)]
*  Coding is very similar that way. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1259.9599999999998s)]
*  You can reduce it and view it very, very reductively. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1261.28s)]
*  So there is no differentiation in code. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1264.6399999999999s)]
*  And so I think Freiburg is right. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1267.28s)]
*  So for example, let's say you're gonna start a company today. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1268.8s)]
*  Why do you even care what database you use? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1272.6s)]
*  Why do you even care which cloud you're built on? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1276.6799999999998s)]
*  To Freiburg's point, why do any of these things matter? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1281.4s)]
*  They don't matter. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1284.3200000000002s)]
*  They were decisions that used to matter [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1285.16s)]
*  when people had a job to do [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1287.4s)]
*  and you paid them for their judgment. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1289.5600000000002s)]
*  Oh, well, we think GCP is better [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1291.0800000000002s)]
*  for this specific workload. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1292.76s)]
*  And we think that this database architecture [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1294.72s)]
*  is better for that specific workload. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1296.64s)]
*  And we're gonna run this on AWS, but that on Azure. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1298.16s)]
*  And do you think an agent cares? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1302.1200000000001s)]
*  If you tell an agent, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1304.4s)]
*  find me the cheapest way to execute this thing. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1305.3600000000001s)]
*  And if it ever gets not cheaper to go someplace else, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1308.76s)]
*  do that for me as well and ETL all the data [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1311.72s)]
*  and put it in the other thing. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1314.8799999999999s)]
*  And I don't really care. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1315.8799999999999s)]
*  So you're saying it will swap out Stripe for Adyen [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1317.44s)]
*  or the node for Amazon Web Services. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1320.64s)]
*  It's going to be ruthless. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1323.2s)]
*  It's gonna be ruthless. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1324.56s)]
*  And I think that the point of that, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1325.64s)]
*  and that's the exact perfect word, Jason. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1327.4s)]
*  AI is ruthless because it's emotionless. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1329.72s)]
*  It was not taken to a steak dinner. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1332.28s)]
*  It was not brought to a basketball game. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1335.12s)]
*  It was not sold into a CEO. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1337.64s)]
*  It's an agent that looked at a bunch of API endpoints, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1340.44s)]
*  figured out how to write code to it [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1344.64s)]
*  to get done the job at hand that was passed to it [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1346.88s)]
*  within a budget. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1349.8400000000001s)]
*  The other thing that's important [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1350.8000000000002s)]
*  is these agents execute within budgets. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1351.8400000000001s)]
*  So another good example was, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1354.96s)]
*  and this is a much simpler one, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1357.68s)]
*  but a guy said, I would like seven days worth of meals. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1359.72s)]
*  Here are my constraints from a dietary perspective. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1365.72s)]
*  Here are also my budgetary constraints. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1368.88s)]
*  And then what this agent did was figured out [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1371.2s)]
*  how to go and use the Instacart plugin at the time [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1373.64s)]
*  and then these other things and execute within the budget. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1376.32s)]
*  How is that different when you're a person [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1379.96s)]
*  that raises $500,000 and says, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1381.88s)]
*  I need a full stack solution that does X, Y, and Z [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1384.4s)]
*  for $200,000? [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1386.76s)]
*  It's the exact same problem. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1388.2s)]
*  So I think it's just a matter of time [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1390.8s)]
*  until we start to cannibalize these extremely expensive, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1393.08s)]
*  ossified large organizations that have relied [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1397.4399999999998s)]
*  on a very complicated go-to-market [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1400.32s)]
*  and sales and marketing motion. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1402.04s)]
*  I don't think you need it anymore in a world of agents [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1403.4399999999998s)]
*  and auto GPTs. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1405.6799999999998s)]
*  And I think that to me is quite interesting [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1407.08s)]
*  because A, it creates an obvious set [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1409.72s)]
*  of public company shorts. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1412.72s)]
*  And then B, you actually want to arm the rebels. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1415.24s)]
*  And arming the rebels, to use the Toby Lutke analogy here, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1419.08s)]
*  would mean to seed hundreds of one-person teams, hundreds, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1422.52s)]
*  and just say, go and build this entire stack all over again [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1428.1200000000001s)]
*  using a bunch of agents. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1430.76s)]
*  Yeah, I have a- [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1432.64s)]
*  And I think recursively, you'll get to that answer [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1433.48s)]
*  in less than a year. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1435.1200000000001s)]
*  Interestingly, when you talk about the emotion [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1437.52s)]
*  of making these decisions, if you look at Hollywood, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1440.68s)]
*  I just interviewed on my other podcast, the founder of- [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1443.2s)]
*  You have another podcast? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1447.6s)]
*  I do, it's called The Swing of Stars, thank you. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1448.8s)]
*  Is it successful? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1450.84s)]
*  Every episode you've been on are four times, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1451.6399999999999s)]
*  it's millions of dollars a year. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1452.9199999999998s)]
*  Please, don't give him an excuse to plug it. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1454.1599999999999s)]
*  Listen, I'm not gonna plug this week in startups [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1455.8s)]
*  available on Spotify and iTunes and YouTube.com [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1458.0s)]
*  slash this weekend. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1460.76s)]
*  Runway is the name of this company I interviewed. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1461.8799999999999s)]
*  And what's fascinating about this is, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1463.9199999999998s)]
*  he told me on everything, everywhere, all at once, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1465.96s)]
*  the award-winning film, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1469.6399999999999s)]
*  they had seven visual effects people on it, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1471.6s)]
*  and they were using his software. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1473.96s)]
*  The late night shows like Colbert and stuff like that [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1476.0s)]
*  are using it. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1478.12s)]
*  They are ruthless in terms of creating [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1479.16s)]
*  crazy visual effects now without, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1481.0800000000002s)]
*  and you can do text prompt to get video output. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1483.88s)]
*  And it is quite reasonable what's coming out of it, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1488.16s)]
*  but you can also train it on existing data sets. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1491.0s)]
*  So they're gonna be able to take something, Sax, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1493.68s)]
*  like The Simpsons, or South Park, or Star Wars, or Marvel, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1495.96s)]
*  take the entire corpus of the comic books and the movies [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1501.24s)]
*  and the TV shows, and then have people type in, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1504.28s)]
*  have Iron Man do this, have Luke Skywalker do that, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1506.96s)]
*  and it's going to output stuff. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1510.76s)]
*  And I said, hey, when would this reach [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1511.88s)]
*  the level that the Mandalorian TV show is? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1515.32s)]
*  And he said, within two years. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1517.76s)]
*  Now, he's talking his own book, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1519.04s)]
*  but it's quite possible that all these visual effects people [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1520.4s)]
*  from industrial light magic on down [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1524.6000000000001s)]
*  are going to be replaced with director, Sax, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1527.44s)]
*  who are currently using this technology to do, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1530.3600000000001s)]
*  what do they call the images that go with the script? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1533.8400000000001s)]
*  Storyboards. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1536.08s)]
*  Storyboards, thank you. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1536.9199999999998s)]
*  They're doing storyboards in this right now. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1538.1999999999998s)]
*  The difference between the storyboards, Sax, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1540.4399999999998s)]
*  and the output is closing in the next 30 months, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1542.84s)]
*  I would say. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1546.24s)]
*  I mean, maybe you could speak to a little bit [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1547.72s)]
*  about the pace here, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1549.32s)]
*  because that is the perfect ruthless example of ruthless AI. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1550.32s)]
*  I mean, you could have the entire team [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1553.04s)]
*  at Industrial Light Magix or Pixar [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1555.4399999999998s)]
*  be unnecessary this decade. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1557.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, you see a bunch of the pieces already there. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1560.6s)]
*  So you have stable diffusion. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1563.04s)]
*  You have the ability to type in the image that you want, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1564.32s)]
*  and it spits out a version of it [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1566.84s)]
*  or 10 different versions of it, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1569.32s)]
*  and you can pick which one you want to go with. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1570.1599999999999s)]
*  You have the ability to create characters. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1572.32s)]
*  You have the ability to create voices. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1574.24s)]
*  You have the ability to replicate a celebrity voice. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1577.36s)]
*  The only thing that's not there yet, as far as I know, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1580.6s)]
*  is the ability to take static images [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1583.4399999999998s)]
*  and string them together into a motion picture. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1585.32s)]
*  But that seems like it's coming really soon. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1587.96s)]
*  So yeah, in theory, you should be able to train the model [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1589.72s)]
*  where you just give it a screenplay [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1592.88s)]
*  and it outputs essentially an animated movie. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1595.1200000000001s)]
*  And then you should be able to fine tune it [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1598.4s)]
*  by choosing the voices that you want [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1599.8000000000002s)]
*  and the characters that you want and that kind of stuff. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1601.3200000000002s)]
*  So yeah, I think we're close to it. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1604.92s)]
*  Now, I think that the question though is, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1607.4s)]
*  every nine, let's call it a reliability, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1610.48s)]
*  is a big advancement. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1614.0s)]
*  So yeah, it might be easy to get to 90% within two years, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1615.0800000000002s)]
*  but it might take another two years [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1619.92s)]
*  to go from 90 to 99%. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1621.16s)]
*  And then it might take another two years [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1623.1200000000001s)]
*  to get to 99.9 and so on. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1624.3200000000002s)]
*  And so to actually get to the point [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1627.04s)]
*  where you're at this stage where you can release [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1628.5600000000002s)]
*  a theatrical quality movie, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1631.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm sure it will take a lot longer than two years. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1632.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, but look at this, Sax. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1634.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm just gonna show you one image. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1635.64s)]
*  The input was aerial drone footage of a mountain range. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1637.4s)]
*  And this is what it came up with. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1640.8400000000001s)]
*  Now, if you were watching TV in the 80s or 90s [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1642.1200000000001s)]
*  on a non-HD TV, this would look indistinguishable [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1644.96s)]
*  from anything you've seen. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1648.36s)]
*  And so this is at a pace that's kind of crazy. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1649.9599999999998s)]
*  There's also opportunity here, right, Friedberg? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1652.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, if we were to look at something like The Simpsons, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1654.84s)]
*  which has gone on for 30 years, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1657.6s)]
*  if young people watching The Simpsons [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1659.84s)]
*  could create their own scenarios or with auto GPT, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1662.24s)]
*  imagine you told The Simpsons stable diffusion instance, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1666.9199999999998s)]
*  read what's happening in the news, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1672.6399999999999s)]
*  have Bart Simpson respond to it, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1674.4399999999998s)]
*  have the South Park characters parody [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1676.16s)]
*  whatever happened in the news today. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1679.28s)]
*  You could have automated real-time episodes of South Park [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1681.1200000000001s)]
*  just being published onto some website. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1684.8000000000002s)]
*  Before you move on, did you see the Wonder Studio demo? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1687.4s)]
*  We can pull this one up, it's really cool. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1691.4s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1693.16s)]
*  This is a startup that's using this type of technology [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1694.0s)]
*  and the way it works is you film a live action scene [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1697.68s)]
*  with a regular actor, but then you can just drag and drop [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1703.0400000000002s)]
*  an animated character onto it [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1706.36s)]
*  and it then converts that scene [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1708.4s)]
*  into a movie with that character. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1711.28s)]
*  Like Planet of the Apes or Lord of the Rings, right? [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1714.16s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1715.92s)]
*  And he's Sardakis, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1716.76s)]
*  was he the person who kept winning all the Oscars? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1717.6s)]
*  So there it goes after the robot has replaced the human. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1719.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1722.68s)]
*  You can imagine like every piece of this [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1723.52s)]
*  just eventually gets swapped out with AI, right? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1725.08s)]
*  Like you should be able to tell the AI, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1727.8s)]
*  give me a picture of a human leaving a building, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1730.8s)]
*  like a Victorian era building in New York. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1737.6399999999999s)]
*  And certainly it can give you a static image of that. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1741.0s)]
*  So it's not that far to then give you a video of that, right? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1743.1599999999999s)]
*  And so, yeah, I think we're pretty close for, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1747.24s)]
*  let's call it hobbyists or amateurs, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1750.24s)]
*  to be able to create pretty nice looking movies [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1751.96s)]
*  using these types of tools. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1755.84s)]
*  But again, I think there's a jump to get to the point [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1757.48s)]
*  where you're just altogether replacing. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1760.32s)]
*  One of the things I'll say on this [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1763.56s)]
*  is we still keep trying to relate it back [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1764.9199999999998s)]
*  to the way media narrative has been explored [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1767.24s)]
*  and written by humans in the past. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1771.3999999999999s)]
*  Very kind of linear storytelling. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1773.3999999999999s)]
*  It's a two hour movie, 30 minute TV segment, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1776.52s)]
*  eight minute YouTube clip, 30 second Instagram clip, whatever. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1779.0s)]
*  But one of the enabling capabilities [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1783.1599999999999s)]
*  with this set of tools is that these stories, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1786.56s)]
*  the way that they're rendered [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1791.52s)]
*  and the way that they're explored by individuals [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1792.56s)]
*  can be fairly dynamic. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1795.28s)]
*  You could watch a movie with the same story, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1798.32s)]
*  all four of us could watch a movie with the same story, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1801.44s)]
*  but from totally different vantage points. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1804.28s)]
*  And some of us could watch it in an 18 minute version [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1806.28s)]
*  or a two hour version or a three season episodic version, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1808.52s)]
*  where the way that this opens up the potential for creators. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1813.76s)]
*  So now I'm kind of saying, before I was saying, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1817.6399999999999s)]
*  hey, individuals can make their own movies and videos. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1820.48s)]
*  That's gonna be incredible. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1822.68s)]
*  There's a separate, I think, creative output here, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1823.92s)]
*  which is the leveling up that happens with creators [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1828.04s)]
*  that maybe wasn't possible to them before. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1832.08s)]
*  So perhaps a creator writes a short book, a short story, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1834.24s)]
*  and then that short story gets rendered into a system [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1838.08s)]
*  that can allow each one of us to explore it [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1840.8799999999999s)]
*  and enjoy it in different ways. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1843.0s)]
*  And I, as the creator, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1844.72s)]
*  can define those different vantage points. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1846.52s)]
*  I, as the creator, can say, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1848.4s)]
*  here's a little bit of this personality, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1849.68s)]
*  this character trait. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1852.04s)]
*  And so what I can now do as a creator [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1853.28s)]
*  is stuff that I never imagined I could do before. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1855.04s)]
*  Think about old school photographers [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1857.72s)]
*  doing black and white photography with pinhole cameras, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1859.28s)]
*  and then they come across Adobe Photoshop. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1862.2s)]
*  What they can do with Adobe Photoshop [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1864.24s)]
*  was stuff that they could never conceptualize of [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1865.96s)]
*  in those old days. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1868.6s)]
*  I think what's gonna happen for creators going forward, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1869.56s)]
*  and this is going back to that point [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1871.92s)]
*  that we had last week or two weeks ago [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1873.24s)]
*  about the guy that was like, hey, I'm out of a job. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1874.8400000000001s)]
*  I actually think that the opportunity [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1876.92s)]
*  for creating new stuff in new ways [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1878.68s)]
*  is so profoundly expanding [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1880.96s)]
*  that individuals can now write entire universes [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1883.3600000000001s)]
*  that can then be enjoyed by millions of people [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1886.68s)]
*  from completely different lengths and viewpoints [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1889.16s)]
*  and models that can be interactive, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1891.3600000000001s)]
*  they can be static, they can be dynamic, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1893.96s)]
*  and that the tooling that you- [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1896.4s)]
*  Personalized. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1897.24s)]
*  Personalized, but the tooling that you, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1898.0800000000002s)]
*  as a creator now have, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1899.72s)]
*  you could choose which characters you wanna define, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1901.12s)]
*  you could choose which content you wanna write, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1903.4399999999998s)]
*  you could choose which content you want the AI [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1907.12s)]
*  to fill in for you, and say, hey, [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1909.04s)]
*  create 50 other characters in the village, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1910.9199999999998s)]
*  and then when the viewer reads the book [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1912.9599999999998s)]
*  or watches the movie, let them explore [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1914.52s)]
*  or have a different interaction [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1916.7199999999998s)]
*  with a set of those villagers in that village, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1917.9599999999998s)]
*  or you could say, hey, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1920.76s)]
*  here's the one character everyone has to meet, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1921.6s)]
*  here's what I want them to say, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1923.4799999999998s)]
*  and you can define the dialogue. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1924.84s)]
*  And so the way that creators can start to kind of [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1926.4799999999998s)]
*  harness their creative chops [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1928.8s)]
*  and create new kinds of modalities for content [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1930.6s)]
*  and for exploration, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1934.24s)]
*  I think is gonna be so beautiful and incredible. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1935.48s)]
*  I mean, Friberg. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1937.4s)]
*  Yeah, you can choose the limits of [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1939.56s)]
*  how much you want the individual to enjoy from your content [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1941.56s)]
*  versus how narrowly you wanna define it, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1944.84s)]
*  and my guess is that the creators that are gonna win [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1946.8s)]
*  are gonna be the ones that are gonna create [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1949.76s)]
*  more dynamic range in the creative output, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1951.04s)]
*  and then individuals are gonna kind of be stuck, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1953.72s)]
*  they're gonna be more into that than they will [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1956.64s)]
*  with the static, everyone watches the same thing [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1958.8799999999999s)]
*  over and over, so there will be a whole new world [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1960.08s)]
*  of creators that maybe have a different set of tools [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1961.9199999999998s)]
*  than what you realize in the last generation. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1965.1599999999999s)]
*  To build on what you're saying, Friberg, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1967.8799999999999s)]
*  which I think is incredibly insightful, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1969.08s)]
*  just think about the controversy around [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1970.56s)]
*  two aspects of a franchise like James Bond. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1972.8s)]
*  Number one, who's your favorite Bond? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1975.36s)]
*  We grew up with Roger Moore, we leaned towards that, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1977.1599999999999s)]
*  then we discovered Sean Connery, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1979.1599999999999s)]
*  and then all of a sudden you see the latest one, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1980.28s)]
*  he's just extraordinary, and Daniel Craig, you're like, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1982.76s)]
*  you know what, that's the one that I love most. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1986.4399999999998s)]
*  Well, what if you could take any of the films, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1988.04s)]
*  you could say, give me the spy who loved me, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1989.52s)]
*  but put Daniel Craig in it, et cetera, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1991.48s)]
*  and that would be available to you, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1993.68s)]
*  and then think about the next controversy, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1994.6399999999999s)]
*  which is, oh my God, does James Bond need to be a white guy [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1996.08s)]
*  from the UK? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=1999.2s)]
*  Of course not, you can release it around the world, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2000.04s)]
*  and each region could get their own celebrity, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2002.32s)]
*  their number one celebrity, to play the lead, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2005.46s)]
*  and controversy over. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2007.72s)]
*  You know the old story, the Epic of Gilgamesh, right? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2009.84s)]
*  So that story was retold in dozens of different languages, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2012.02s)]
*  and it was told through the oral tradition, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2015.92s)]
*  it was spoken by bards around a fire pit and whatnot, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2018.4s)]
*  and all of those stories were told [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2021.3600000000001s)]
*  with different characters and different names [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2022.88s)]
*  and different experiences, some of them were 10 minutes long, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2024.76s)]
*  some of them were multi-hour sagas [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2027.96s)]
*  explained through the story, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2029.8400000000001s)]
*  but ultimately the morality of the story, the storyline, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2031.26s)]
*  the intentionality of the original creator of that story [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2034.8000000000002s)]
*  came through. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2037.64s)]
*  The Bible is another good example of this, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2038.48s)]
*  where much of the underlying morality and ethics [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2040.24s)]
*  in the Bible comes through in different stories [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2042.16s)]
*  read by different people in different languages, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2044.2s)]
*  and I think that may be where we go, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2046.32s)]
*  my kids wanna have a 10 minute bedtime story, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2048.28s)]
*  well let me give them Peter Pan in 10 minutes, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2050.56s)]
*  I wanna do a chapter a night for my older daughter [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2052.4s)]
*  for a week long of Peter Pan, now I can do that, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2055.56s)]
*  and so the way that I can consume content becomes different. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2058.32s)]
*  So I guess what I'm saying is there's two aspects [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2062.4s)]
*  to the way that I think the entire content, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2064.74s)]
*  the realm of content can be rewritten through AI, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2067.08s)]
*  the first is individual personalized creation of content [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2070.56s)]
*  that I as a user can render content [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2073.26s)]
*  that was of my liking and my interest, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2075.82s)]
*  the second is that I can engage with content [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2077.98s)]
*  that is being created that is so much more multi-dimensional [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2080.7400000000002s)]
*  than anything we conceive of today, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2083.38s)]
*  where current centralized content creators [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2084.98s)]
*  now have a whole set of tools. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2086.6600000000003s)]
*  Now from a business model perspective, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2088.0600000000004s)]
*  I don't think that publishers are really the play anymore, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2089.9s)]
*  but I do think that platforms are gonna be the play, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2092.5400000000004s)]
*  and the platform tooling that enables the individuals [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2094.5400000000004s)]
*  to do this stuff and the platform tooling [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2097.1000000000004s)]
*  that enables the content creators to do this stuff [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2098.5400000000004s)]
*  are definitely entirely new industries and models [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2101.14s)]
*  that can create multi-hundred billion dollar outcomes. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2103.8599999999997s)]
*  Let me hand this off to Sax because there has been [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2106.7799999999997s)]
*  the dream for everybody, especially in the Bay Area, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2109.1s)]
*  of a hero coming and saving Gotham City. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2113.18s)]
*  And this has finally been realized. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2116.6s)]
*  David Sax, I did my own little Twitter AI hashtag, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2119.7s)]
*  and I said to Twitter AI, if only, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2124.7799999999997s)]
*  please generate a picture of David Sax's [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2128.58s)]
*  Batman crouched down on the peak of the Golden Gate Bridge. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2130.22s)]
*  The amount of creativity, Sax, that came from this, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2133.58s)]
*  and this is something that, you know, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2136.1s)]
*  if we were talking about just five years ago, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2140.2599999999998s)]
*  this would be like a $10,000 image you could create [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2141.8199999999997s)]
*  for your birthday present. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2144.4199999999996s)]
*  And by the way, these were not professional [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2145.2599999999998s)]
*  quote unquote artists. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2147.06s)]
*  These were individuals. Oh, these were super fans. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2148.22s)]
*  Individuals that were able to harness [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2149.7s)]
*  a set of platform tools to generate [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2151.54s)]
*  this incredible new content. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2153.66s)]

*  And by the way, we're in inning one, right? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2156.9399999999996s)]
*  So, you know, fast forward. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2158.38s)]
*  Sax, when you see yourself as Batman, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2159.5s)]
*  do you ever think you should take your enormous wealth [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2161.42s)]
*  and resources and put it towards building a cave [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2163.78s)]
*  under your mansion that lets you out [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2166.54s)]
*  underneath the Golden Gate Bridge [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2169.26s)]
*  and you could go fight crime? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2170.38s)]
*  Oh, so good, so good. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2171.2200000000003s)]

*  I think San Francisco has a lot of Gotham-like qualities. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2176.7000000000003s)]
*  I think the villains are more real than the heroes. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2179.3s)]
*  Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of heroes, but. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2181.98s)]
*  Yeah, we got a lot of jokers. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2183.7000000000003s)]

*  That's a whole separate topic I'm sure we'll get to. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2187.7799999999997s)]
*  Whole separate topic we'll get to at some point today. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2189.62s)]
*  You guys are talking about all this stupid bullshit. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2191.62s)]
*  Like, there are trillions of dollars of software companies [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2193.98s)]
*  that could get disrupted, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2196.34s)]
*  and you're talking about making fucking children's books [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2197.18s)]
*  and fat pictures of Sax. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2199.02s)]
*  It's so dumb. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2200.34s)]
*  No, Sax looks thin. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2201.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, conversation is idiotic. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2202.1s)]
*  The point is, the entertainment industry [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2202.94s)]
*  is one of the great jobs. Jason, you are doing a shit job. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2204.2999999999997s)]
*  No, nobody cares about entertainment anymore [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2205.54s)]
*  because it's totally confused. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2207.46s)]
*  Okay, so why don't you talk about [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2208.58s)]
*  one of the biggest industries that exports America. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2209.42s)]
*  Where the money is. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2210.2599999999998s)]
*  Why don't you teach people where there's going to be [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2211.38s)]
*  actual economic destruction at a grand scale. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2213.74s)]
*  This is going to be amazing economic destruction [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2215.18s)]
*  and opportunity. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2217.22s)]
*  He's got a point. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2218.06s)]
*  You spend all this time on the most stupidest [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2218.9s)]
*  fucking topics. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2220.66s)]
*  Listen, it's an illustrative example. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2221.62s)]
*  No, it's an elitist example that you fucking circle [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2223.74s)]
*  jerk yourselves around. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2226.58s)]
*  It's populist, Batman's not populist. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2227.42s)]
*  Nobody cares about movies. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2229.06s)]
*  Well, let's bring up your lording tweet over everybody [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2230.8199999999997s)]
*  about how. No, it is a good point. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2233.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think US box office is something like [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2234.18s)]
*  20 billion a year. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2236.2599999999998s)]
*  I remember when PayPal got to like [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2237.1s)]
*  a hundred billion a year payment volume, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2239.02s)]
*  and now it's like hundreds of billions. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2240.7799999999997s)]
*  Like Adyen and Stripe are going to process [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2242.5s)]
*  two trillion dollars almost. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2244.3s)]
*  Why don't you talk about that disruption, you ninny. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2245.66s)]
*  Market size of US media and entertainment industry, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2247.78s)]
*  717 billion. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2249.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2251.02s)]
*  It's not insignificant. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2251.86s)]
*  Video games are nearly half a trillion a year. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2253.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2255.9s)]
*  I mean, this is not insignificant, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2256.7400000000002s)]
*  but let's pull up Chamath's tweet. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2258.3s)]
*  Of course, the dictator wants to dictate here. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2260.26s)]
*  All this incredible innovation is being made. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2262.34s)]
*  And a new hero has been born Chamath Palihapitiya. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2264.9s)]
*  A tweet that went viral over 1.2 million views [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2269.7s)]
*  already. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2273.34s)]
*  I'll read your tweet for the audience. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2274.1800000000003s)]
*  If you invent a novel drug, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2275.02s)]
*  you need the government to vet and approve it. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2277.1400000000003s)]
*  FDA before you can commercialize it. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2279.2200000000003s)]
*  If you invent a new mode of air travel, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2280.6600000000003s)]
*  you need the government to vet and approve it. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2282.7400000000002s)]
*  FAA. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2284.3s)]
*  I'm just going to edit this down a little bit. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2285.42s)]
*  If you create new security, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2286.7400000000002s)]
*  you need the government to vet it and approve it. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2287.98s)]
*  SEC more generally, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2289.42s)]
*  when you create things with broad societal impact, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2290.62s)]
*  positive and negative, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2293.34s)]
*  the government creates a layer to review and approve it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2294.3s)]
*  AI will need such an oversight body. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2296.46s)]
*  The FDA approval process seems the most credible [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2298.94s)]
*  and adaptable into a framework to understand [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2301.5s)]
*  how a model behaves and it's counterfactual. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2304.58s)]
*  Our political leaders need to get in front of this sooner, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2309.38s)]
*  rather than later and create some oversight [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2311.86s)]
*  before the eventual big avoidable mistakes happen [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2314.06s)]
*  and genies are let out of the bottle. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2317.14s)]
*  Chamath, you really want the government to come in. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2318.54s)]
*  And then when people build these tools, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2321.5s)]
*  they have to submit them to the government to approve them. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2324.42s)]
*  That's what you're saying here. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2326.7s)]
*  And you want that to start now. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2327.86s)]
*  Here's the alternative. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2329.7s)]
*  The alternative is going to be the debacle [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2330.98s)]
*  that we know as Section 230. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2332.98s)]
*  So if you try to write a brittle piece of legislation [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2334.78s)]
*  or try to use old legislation to deal with something new, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2339.38s)]
*  it's not going to do a good job [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2345.66s)]
*  because technology advances way too quickly. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2346.86s)]
*  And so if you look at the Section 230 example, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2350.3s)]
*  where have we left ourselves? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2352.82s)]
*  The politicians have a complete inability [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2354.3s)]
*  to pass a new framework, to deal with social media, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2357.2200000000003s)]
*  to deal with misinformation. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2359.78s)]
*  And so now we're all kind of guessing [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2361.5400000000004s)]
*  what a bunch of 70 and 80 year old Supreme Court justices [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2363.7400000000002s)]
*  will do in trying to rewrite technology law [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2369.0600000000004s)]
*  when they have to opine on Section 230. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2372.38s)]
*  So the point of that tweet was to lay the alternatives. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2374.42s)]
*  There is no world in which this will be unregulated. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2379.2200000000003s)]
*  And so I think the question to ask ourselves is, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2383.6600000000003s)]
*  do we want a chance for a new body? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2386.2599999999998s)]
*  So the FDA is a perfect example why. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2390.06s)]
*  Even though the FDA commissioner [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2392.3799999999997s)]
*  is appointed by the president, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2394.06s)]
*  this is a quasi organization. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2395.18s)]
*  It's still arms length away. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2397.4199999999996s)]
*  It has subject matter experts that they hire, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2399.8999999999996s)]
*  and they have many pathways to approval. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2403.66s)]
*  Some pathways take days, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2406.74s)]
*  some pathways are months and years, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2409.3399999999997s)]
*  some pathways are for breakthrough innovations, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2411.4599999999996s)]
*  some pathways are for devices. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2413.62s)]
*  So they have a broad spectrum of ways of arbitrating [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2415.5s)]
*  what can be commercialized and what cannot. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2419.82s)]
*  Otherwise, my prediction is we will have a very brittle law [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2422.62s)]
*  that will not work. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2426.82s)]
*  It'll be like the Commerce Department and the FTC [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2427.9s)]
*  trying to gerrymander some old piece of legislation. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2431.42s)]
*  And then what will happen is it'll get escalated [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2435.06s)]
*  to the Supreme Court. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2437.42s)]
*  And I think they are the last group of people [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2438.38s)]
*  who should be deciding [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2441.42s)]
*  on this incredibly important topic for society. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2443.66s)]
*  So what I have been advocating our leaders, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2445.94s)]
*  and I will continue to do so, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2450.7799999999997s)]
*  is don't try to ram this into an existing body. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2451.98s)]
*  It is so important, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2455.74s)]
*  it is worth creating a new organization like the FDA, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2456.7799999999997s)]
*  and having a framework that allows you to look at a model [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2461.22s)]
*  and look at the counterfactual, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2465.1s)]
*  judge how good, how important, how disruptive it is, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2467.1s)]
*  and then release it in the wild appropriately. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2472.02s)]
*  Otherwise, I think you'll have these chaos GPT things [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2473.9s)]
*  scale infinitely, because again, as Friedberg said, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2477.46s)]
*  and as Sachs said, you're talking about one person [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2480.54s)]
*  that can create this chaos. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2482.2999999999997s)]
*  Multiply that by every person that is an anarchist [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2484.14s)]
*  or every person that just wants to sow seeds of chaos, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2487.22s)]
*  and I think it's gonna be all avoidable. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2490.22s)]
*  I think regulating what software people can write [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2492.18s)]
*  is a near impossible task, number one. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2495.02s)]
*  I think you can probably put rules and restrictions [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2497.74s)]
*  around commerce, right? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2499.8599999999997s)]
*  That's certainly feasible [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2501.82s)]
*  in terms of how people can monetize, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2503.22s)]
*  but in terms of writing and utilizing software, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2504.86s)]
*  it's gonna be as challenged as trying to monitor [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2508.22s)]
*  and demand oversight and regulation around [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2512.34s)]
*  how people write and use tools [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2515.7s)]
*  for genome and biology exploration. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2518.5s)]
*  Certainly, if you wanna take a product to market [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2522.1s)]
*  and sell a drug to people that can influence their body, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2523.78s)]
*  you have to go get that approved, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2526.5s)]
*  but in terms of doing your work in a lab, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2528.26s)]
*  it's very difficult. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2531.5s)]
*  I think the other challenge here [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2532.5s)]
*  is software can be written anywhere, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2534.3s)]
*  it can be executed anywhere, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2538.1000000000004s)]
*  and so if the US does try to regulate [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2540.1000000000004s)]
*  or does try to put the brakes on the development of tools [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2544.1000000000004s)]
*  where the US can have kind of a great economic benefit [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2548.26s)]
*  and a great economic interest, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2551.1400000000003s)]
*  there will be advances made elsewhere without a doubt, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2553.1800000000003s)]
*  and those markets and those places [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2556.9s)]
*  will benefit in an extraordinarily outpaced way. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2560.7400000000002s)]
*  As we just mentioned, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2564.6600000000003s)]
*  there's such extraordinary kind of economic gain [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2565.78s)]
*  to be realized here that if we're not, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2568.78s)]
*  if the United States is not leading the world, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2571.9s)]
*  we are gonna be following, we are gonna get disrupted, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2575.34s)]
*  we are gonna lose an incredible amount of value and talent, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2577.42s)]
*  and so any attempt at regulation or slowing down [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2580.1400000000003s)]
*  or telling people that they cannot do things [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2583.78s)]
*  when they can easily hop on a plane [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2585.98s)]
*  and go do it elsewhere, I think is fraught with peril. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2587.58s)]
*  So you don't agree with regulation. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2590.86s)]
*  Sax, are you onboard with the Chamath Plan [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2592.3s)]
*  or are you onboard with the Freiburg Plan? [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2594.86s)]
*  I'll say, I think just like with computer hacking, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2596.22s)]
*  it's illegal to break into someone else's computer. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2598.46s)]
*  It is illegal to steal someone's personal information. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2600.7s)]
*  There are laws that are absolutely simple and obvious [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2603.22s)]
*  and no-nonsense laws. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2607.1s)]
*  Those laws need to be implemented. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2610.26s)]
*  It's not illegal to get rid of 100,000 jobs [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2611.1s)]
*  by making a piece of software, though. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2613.38s)]
*  That's right, and so I think trying to intentionalize [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2615.18s)]
*  how we do things versus intentionalizing the things [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2618.46s)]
*  that we wanna prohibit happening as an outcome, [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2622.46s)]
*  we can certainly try and prohibit the things [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2624.66s)]
*  that we wanna happen as an outcome and pass laws [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2626.2999999999997s)]
*  and institute governing bodies with authority [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2629.22s)]
*  to oversee those laws with respect [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2631.66s)]
*  to things like stealing data. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2634.7s)]
*  But you can jump on a plane and go do it in Mexico, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2636.06s)]
*  Canada, or whatever region you get to. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2638.4199999999996s)]
*  Sax, where do you stand on this debate? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2640.22s)]
*  No, no, yeah, I'm saying there are ways to protect people. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2641.66s)]
*  There's ways to protect society about passing laws [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2644.1s)]
*  that make it illegal to do things as the output, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2646.46s)]
*  as the outcome. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2648.5s)]
*  What law do you pass on Chaos GPT? [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2649.3399999999997s)]
*  Explain Chaos GPT, give an example, please. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2651.1s)]
*  Yeah, do you wanna talk about it real quick? [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2653.42s)]
*  It's a recursive agent that basically [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2655.06s)]
*  is trying to destroy itself. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2657.2599999999998s)]
*  Trying to destroy humanity. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2660.06s)]
*  Yeah, but I guess by first becoming all-powerful [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2661.18s)]
*  and destroying humanity and then destroying itself. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2663.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's a tongue-in-cheek auto GPT. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2665.7799999999997s)]
*  But it's not a tongue-in-cheek auto GPT. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2669.9s)]
*  The guy that created it put it out there and said, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2673.26s)]
*  like he's trying to show everyone, to your point, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2675.58s)]
*  what intentionality could arise here, [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2677.7400000000002s)]
*  which is negative intentionality. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2679.62s)]
*  I think it's very naive for anybody to think that [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2681.1s)]
*  this is not equivalent to something [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2685.18s)]
*  that could cause harm to you. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2687.92s)]
*  So for example, if the prompt is, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2689.96s)]
*  hey, here is a security leak that we figured out in Windows [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2692.3s)]
*  and so why don't you exploit it? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2695.62s)]
*  So look, a hacker now has to be very technical. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2697.9s)]
*  Today, with these auto GPTs, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2701.14s)]
*  a hacker does not need to be technical at all. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2703.22s)]
*  Exploit the zero-day exploit in Windows, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2704.8199999999997s)]
*  hack into this plane and bring it down. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2708.74s)]
*  Oh, okay, the GPT will do it. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2710.62s)]
*  So who's gonna tell you that those things are not allowed? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2712.9s)]
*  Who's gonna actually vet that that wasn't allowed [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2715.42s)]
*  to be released in the wild? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2718.14s)]
*  So for example, if you worked with Amazon and Google [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2719.5s)]
*  and Microsoft and said, you're gonna have to run [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2722.54s)]
*  these things in a sandbox and we're gonna have to observe [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2724.66s)]
*  the output before we allow it to run on actual bare metal [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2727.38s)]
*  and then we're gonna have to run it in the wild, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2731.8s)]
*  again, that seems like a reasonable thing [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2734.2400000000002s)]
*  and it's super naive for people to think [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2736.28s)]
*  it's a free market so we should just be able [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2738.48s)]
*  to do what we want. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2740.32s)]
*  This will end badly quickly. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2741.44s)]
*  And when the first plane goes down [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2743.7200000000003s)]
*  and when the first fucking thing gets blown up, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2745.48s)]
*  all of you guys will be like, oh, sorry. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2747.64s)]
*  That's a pretty compelling example here by Chamath. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2749.36s)]
*  Somebody puts out into the wild, chaos GPT, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2752.2s)]
*  you can go do a Google search for it and says, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2754.44s)]
*  hey, what are the vulnerabilities to the electrical grid? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2756.28s)]
*  A series of attacks and write some code to probe those [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2760.68s)]
*  until we and success in this mission, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2764.48s)]
*  you get 100 points and stars every time you do this. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2766.74s)]
*  Jason, it's such a beautiful example [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2769.56s)]
*  but it's even more nefarious. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2771.8799999999997s)]
*  It is, hey, this is an enemy that's trying to hack [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2773.6s)]
*  our system so you need to hack theirs and bring it down. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2778.12s)]
*  You know, like you can easily trick these GPTs, right? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2780.8399999999997s)]
*  Yes, they have no judgment. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2784.08s)]
*  They have no judgment and as you said, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2785.52s)]
*  they're ruthless in getting to the outcome. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2787.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2790.16s)]
*  So why do we think all of a sudden this is not gonna happen? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2791.58s)]
*  I mean, it's literally the science fiction example. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2794.6s)]
*  You say, hey, listen, make sure no humans get cancer. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2796.32s)]
*  And like, okay, well, the logical way to make sure [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2798.88s)]
*  no humans get cancer is to kill all the humans. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2800.36s)]
*  But Chamath, can you just address the point? [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2802.2799999999997s)]
*  So what do you think you're regulating? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2804.0s)]
*  Are you regulating the code that people are allowed to write? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2805.48s)]
*  If you look at the FDA, no, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2808.48s)]
*  you are allowed to make any chemical drug you want [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2810.2999999999997s)]
*  but if you wanna commercialize it, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2812.16s)]
*  you need to run a series of trials [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2814.04s)]
*  with highly qualified measurable data [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2817.12s)]
*  and you submit it to like-minded experts [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2819.44s)]
*  that are trained as you are [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2821.84s)]
*  to evaluate the viability of that. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2823.52s)]
*  And there are, hold on, there are pathways [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2826.32s)]
*  that allow you to get that done in days [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2828.4s)]
*  under emergency use and then there are pathways [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2830.48s)]
*  that can take years depending on how gargantuan [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2833.0s)]
*  the task is at hand. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2835.76s)]
*  And all I'm suggesting is having some amount of oversight [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2836.64s)]
*  is not bad in this specific example. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2842.04s)]
*  I get what you're saying but I'm asking tactically, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2845.0s)]
*  what are you overseeing? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2847.44s)]
*  You're overseeing chat GPT, you're overseeing the models, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2848.8399999999997s)]
*  the Nvidia chips? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2852.56s)]
*  Okay, look, I used to run the Facebook platform. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2854.56s)]
*  We used to create sandboxes. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2856.66s)]
*  If you submit code to us, we would run it in the sandbox, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2858.2s)]
*  we would observe it, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2862.16s)]
*  we would figure out what it was trying to do [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2863.0s)]
*  and we would tell you this is allowed to run in the wild. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2864.6s)]
*  There's a version of that that Apple does [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2867.62s)]
*  when you submit an app for review and approval. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2869.22s)]
*  Google does it as well. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2872.22s)]
*  In this case, all the bare metal providers, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2873.62s)]
*  all the people that provide GPUs will be forced [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2876.4399999999996s)]
*  by the government in my opinion to implement something. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2879.58s)]
*  And all I'm suggesting is that it should be a new kind [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2883.06s)]
*  of body that essentially observes, that has PhDs, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2886.7799999999997s)]
*  that has people who are trained in this stuff [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2890.8999999999996s)]
*  to develop the kind of testing and the output that you need [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2893.06s)]
*  to figure out whether it should even be allowed [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2897.22s)]
*  to run in the wild on bare metal. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2900.14s)]
*  Sorry, but you're saying that the model, sorry, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2900.98s)]
*  I'm just trying to understand two more points. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2902.74s)]
*  You're saying that the models need to be reviewed [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2903.8599999999997s)]
*  by this body and those models, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2906.4199999999996s)]
*  if they're run on a third party set of servers, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2908.3799999999997s)]
*  if they're run in the wild, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2911.4199999999996s)]
*  right, so if they're run on the open internet. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2913.4199999999996s)]
*  Fieberg, you cannot run an app on your computer, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2917.1s)]
*  you know that, right? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2919.02s)]
*  It needs to be connected to the internet, right? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2919.8599999999997s)]
*  Like if you wanted to run an auto GPT, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2921.48s)]
*  it actually crawls the internet, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2923.66s)]
*  it actually touches other APIs, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2925.22s)]
*  it tries to then basically send a push request, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2926.98s)]
*  sees what it gets back, parses the JSON, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2929.94s)]
*  figures out what it needs to do. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2932.46s)]
*  All of that is allowed because it's hosted by somebody, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2934.5s)]
*  right, that code is running not locally. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2937.22s)]
*  But I could run it locally, so the host becomes. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2939.9s)]
*  Sure, if you want to run it locally, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2942.34s)]
*  you can do whatever you want to do. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2943.94s)]
*  But evil agents are going to do that, right? [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2945.58s)]
*  So if I'm an evil agent, I'm not going to go use AWS [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2947.22s)]
*  to run my evil agent, I'm going to set up a bunch [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2949.86s)]
*  of servers and connect it to the internet. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2951.98s)]
*  How? [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2953.82s)]
*  I could use VPNs, the internet is open, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2955.54s)]
*  there's open packets of data that fly around. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2957.8199999999997s)]
*  If you're talking about people who are in another [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2958.66s)]
*  rogue country, they can do whatever they want. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2960.2599999999998s)]
*  I think that what you're going to see is that if you, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2961.3799999999997s)]
*  for example, try to VPN and run it out of like Tajikistan, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2963.7s)]
*  back to the United States, it's not going to take years [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2967.5s)]
*  for us to figure out that we need to IP block rando shit [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2970.74s)]
*  coming in, push and pull requests from all kinds of IPs [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2973.44s)]
*  that we don't trust anymore because we don't now trust [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2976.2599999999998s)]
*  the regulatory oversight that they have for code [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2978.8599999999997s)]
*  that's running from those IPs that are not US domesticated. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2980.94s)]
*  Let me steal man Chamath's position for a second. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2984.22s)]
*  Jason, hold on. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2986.22s)]
*  I think the ultimate, if what Chamath is saying [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2987.06s)]
*  is the point of view of Congress, and if Chamath [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2990.5s)]
*  has this point of view, then there will certainly [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2993.3399999999997s)]
*  be people in Congress that will adopt this point of view. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2994.8399999999997s)]
*  The only way to ultimately do that degree of regulation [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=2998.16s)]
*  and restriction is going to be to restrict the open internet. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3001.4199999999996s)]
*  It is going to be to have monitoring and firewalls [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3004.3399999999997s)]
*  and safety protocols across the open internet. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3006.4599999999996s)]
*  Because you can have a set of models running on any set [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3008.4399999999996s)]
*  of servers sitting in any physical location, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3010.62s)]
*  and as long as they can move data packets around, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3013.02s)]
*  they're going to be able to get up [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3015.54s)]
*  to their nefarious activities. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3016.62s)]
*  Let me steal man that for you, Freberg. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3019.2599999999998s)]
*  I think, yes, you're correct. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3020.78s)]
*  The internet has existed in a very open way, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3022.82s)]
*  but there are organizations and there are places [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3025.22s)]
*  like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3027.94s)]
*  If I were to steal man Chamath's position, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3030.54s)]
*  if you want to manufacture a car and you want to make one [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3032.66s)]
*  in your backyard and put it on your track [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3036.46s)]
*  on your land up in Napa somewhere, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3038.66s)]
*  and you don't want to have brakes on the car [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3040.98s)]
*  and you don't want to have a speed limiter [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3042.46s)]
*  or airbags or seat belts, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3045.46s)]
*  and you want to drive on the hood of the car, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3046.9s)]
*  you can do that. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3048.5s)]
*  But once you want it to go on the open road, [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3049.34s)]
*  the open internet, you need to submit it [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3050.98s)]
*  for some safety standards like NHTSA, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3053.94s)]
*  like Tesla has to or Ford has to. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3057.26s)]
*  So, Sax, where do you sit on this? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3059.3s)]
*  Let's assume that people are going to do very bad things [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3062.82s)]
*  with very powerful models that are becoming available. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3066.38s)]
*  Amazon today said they'll be Switzerland, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3069.5s)]
*  they're going to put a bunch of LLMs [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3071.1s)]
*  and other models available on AWS, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3072.5s)]
*  Bloomberg's LLM, Facebook's, Google Bard, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3074.94s)]
*  and of course, Chanche APT, OpenAI and Bing, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3078.2599999999998s)]
*  all this stuff's available. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3080.38s)]
*  To have access to that, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3081.46s)]
*  do you need to have some regulation of who has access [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3082.62s)]
*  to those at scale powerful tools? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3085.94s)]
*  Should there be some FDA or NHTSA? [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3088.18s)]
*  I don't think we know how to regulate it yet. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3091.98s)]
*  I think it's too early. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3093.7s)]
*  Clearly, clearly. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3094.54s)]
*  And I think the harms that we're speculating about, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3095.38s)]
*  we're making the AI more powerful than it is. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3097.02s)]
*  And I believe it will be that powerful, [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3100.22s)]
*  but I think that it's premature to be talking [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3101.8199999999997s)]
*  about regulating something that doesn't really exist yet. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3104.14s)]
*  Take the chaos GPT scenario. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3105.94s)]
*  The way that would play out would be, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3108.8199999999997s)]
*  you've got some future incarnation of auto GPT, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3111.3399999999997s)]
*  and somebody says, okay, auto GPT, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3114.8599999999997s)]
*  I want you to be WMD AI [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3117.2599999999998s)]
*  and figure out how to cause like a mass destruction event, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3120.98s)]
*  and then it creates like a planning checklist [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3124.62s)]
*  and that kind of stuff. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3126.54s)]
*  So that's basically the type of scenario [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3127.94s)]
*  we're talking about. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3131.02s)]
*  We're not anywhere close to that yet. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3132.62s)]
*  I mean, the chaos GPT is kind of a joke. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3134.42s)]
*  It doesn't produce a checklist of anything. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3137.2200000000003s)]
*  I can give an example that would actually [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3140.46s)]
*  be completely plausible. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3143.2200000000003s)]
*  One of the first things on the chaos GPT's checklist [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3144.94s)]
*  was to stay within the boundaries of the law [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3147.14s)]
*  because it didn't want to get prosecuted. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3149.02s)]
*  Got it. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3151.06s)]
*  So the person who did that had some sort of good intent, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3151.9s)]
*  but I can give you an example right now [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3154.38s)]
*  that could be done by chat GPT and auto GPT [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3156.7s)]
*  that could take down large swaths of society [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3159.02s)]
*  and cause massive destruction. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3161.06s)]
*  I'm almost reticent to say it here. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3162.18s)]
*  Say it. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3164.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, I'll say it and then maybe we'll have to delete this, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3165.14s)]
*  but if somebody created this and they said, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3166.8199999999997s)]
*  figure out a way to compromise as many powerful peoples [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3169.9399999999996s)]
*  and as many systems passwords, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3173.18s)]
*  then go in there and delete all their files [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3175.3799999999997s)]
*  and turn off as many systems as you can. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3177.5s)]
*  Chat GPT and auto GPT could very easily [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3180.4199999999996s)]
*  create phishing accounts, create billions of websites [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3182.98s)]
*  and create billions of logins, [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3186.02s)]
*  have people log into them, get their passwords, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3187.54s)]
*  log into whatever they do [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3189.94s)]
*  and then delete everything in their accounts, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3191.22s)]
*  which would cause chaos and it could be done today. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3193.3s)]
*  I don't think it can be done today. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3196.38s)]
*  Simpler than this, how about you phishing them [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3197.54s)]
*  and just steal it? You can't create a phishing website? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3199.42s)]
*  Yeah, pieces of it can be created today, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3200.58s)]
*  but you're accelerating the progress. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3202.22s)]
*  Yeah, but you can automate what? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3205.34s)]
*  60 days, 30 days? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3206.18s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3208.3s)]
*  And by the way- I think I'm accelerating it in weeks. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3209.5s)]
*  Why don't you just spoof the bank accounts [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3211.94s)]
*  and just steal the money? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3213.62s)]
*  That's even simpler. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3214.7s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3216.6600000000003s)]
*  People will do this stuff [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3217.5s)]
*  because they're trying to do it today. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3218.34s)]
*  Holy cow. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3219.1800000000003s)]
*  Now they just have a more efficient way [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3220.02s)]
*  to solve the problem. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3220.86s)]
*  Why do you even think about bank accounts? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3221.7000000000003s)]
*  So look, so number one, this is a tool [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3222.54s)]
*  and if people use a tool in nefarious ways, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3224.7000000000003s)]
*  you prosecute them. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3226.46s)]
*  Number two, the platforms that are commercializing [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3227.54s)]
*  these tools do have trust and safety teams. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3230.3s)]
*  Now in the past, trust and safety has been a euphemism [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3233.7000000000003s)]
*  for censorship, which it shouldn't be, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3236.94s)]
*  but you know, OpenAI has a safety team [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3239.26s)]
*  and they try to detect when people are using [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3241.6600000000003s)]
*  their tech in a nefarious way and they try to prevent it. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3244.5s)]
*  Do you trust that team? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3247.54s)]
*  Well, no, not on censorship, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3249.02s)]
*  but I think that they're probably- [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3250.98s)]
*  100 million people are using chat-chats [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3252.86s)]
*  between you think they're policing it? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3254.18s)]
*  Are you willing to abdicate your [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3255.94s)]
*  or societal responsibility to OpenAI [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3258.54s)]
*  to do the trust and safety? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3261.3s)]
*  What I'm saying is I'd like to see how far we get [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3262.9s)]
*  in terms of the system self-regulating. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3265.86s)]
*  Yeah, so you're saying you want to see the mistakes. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3268.06s)]
*  You want to see where the mistakes are [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3269.74s)]
*  and how bad the mistakes are. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3271.42s)]
*  I'm saying it's still very early to be imposing regulation. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3272.54s)]
*  We don't even know what to regulate. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3275.02s)]
*  So I think we have to keep tracking this [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3276.42s)]
*  to develop some understanding of how it might be misused, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3278.82s)]
*  how the industry is going to develop safety guardrails. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3282.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3285.78s)]
*  And then you can talk about regulation. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3286.7s)]
*  Look, you create some new FDA right now. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3288.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3290.74s)]
*  First of all, we know what would happen. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3291.58s)]
*  Look at the drug process. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3292.66s)]
*  As soon as the FDA got involved, it slowed down massively. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3294.58s)]
*  Now it takes years, many years to get a drug approved. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3296.94s)]
*  Appropriately so. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3299.86s)]
*  Yes, but at least with a drug, [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3301.14s)]
*  we know what the gold standard is. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3303.94s)]
*  You run a double blind study to see whether it causes harm [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3305.2999999999997s)]
*  or whether it's beneficial. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3309.62s)]
*  We don't know what that standard is for AI yet. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3310.9s)]
*  We have no idea. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3313.46s)]
*  You can absolutely run a double blind study in AI. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3314.5s)]
*  What? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3317.22s)]
*  No, we don't know that yet. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3318.06s)]
*  You'd have somebody review the code. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3318.9s)]
*  You have two instances in a sandbox. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3319.94s)]
*  Somebody reviews the code to do what? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3321.7799999999997s)]
*  No, Sachs. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3322.62s)]
*  Listen, let me finish my point. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3323.46s)]
*  Auto GPT. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3325.42s)]
*  It's benign. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3327.22s)]
*  I mean, my friend used it to book a wine tasting. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3328.06s)]
*  So who's gonna review that code and then speculate [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3332.86s)]
*  and say, oh, well, 99.9% of cases, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3335.46s)]
*  it's perfectly benevolent and fine and innocuous. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3339.46s)]
*  But I can fantasize about some cases someone might do. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3343.58s)]
*  Hold on, how are you supposed to resolve that? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3346.1s)]
*  Very simple. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3347.94s)]
*  There are two types of regulation [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3348.7799999999997s)]
*  that are concurrent in any industry. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3350.06s)]
*  You can do what the movie industry did, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3351.7s)]
*  which is they self-regulate [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3353.1s)]
*  and they came up with their own rating system, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3354.42s)]
*  or you can do what happens with the FDA [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3356.18s)]
*  and what happens with cars, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3358.62s)]
*  which is an external government-based body. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3359.98s)]
*  I think now is the time for self-regulation [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3362.58s)]
*  so that we avoid the massive heavy hand of government [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3364.94s)]
*  having to come in here. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3368.5s)]
*  But these tools can be used today to create massive harm. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3369.7s)]
*  They're moving at a pace we just said [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3372.5s)]
*  in the first half of the show [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3374.1s)]
*  that none of us have ever seen. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3375.4199999999996s)]
*  Every 48 hours, something drops that is mind blowing. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3376.66s)]
*  That's never happened before. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3379.7799999999997s)]
*  And you can take these tools. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3381.3399999999997s)]
*  And in the one example that Tramath and I came up with [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3384.38s)]
*  at the top of our head in 30 seconds, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3387.3s)]
*  you could create phishing sites, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3389.6600000000003s)]
*  compromise people's bank accounts, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3390.98s)]
*  take all the money out, delete all the files, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3392.54s)]
*  and cause chaos on a scale that has never been possible [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3394.5s)]
*  by a series of Russian hackers or Chinese hackers [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3398.42s)]
*  working in a boiler room. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3401.7000000000003s)]
*  This can scale. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3403.1000000000004s)]
*  And that is the fundamental difference here. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3404.42s)]
*  And I didn't think I would be sitting here [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3406.6200000000003s)]
*  steelmanning Tramath's argument. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3407.82s)]
*  I think humans have a high ability to compound. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3409.26s)]
*  I think people do not understand compound interest. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3411.9s)]
*  And this is a perfect example [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3414.02s)]
*  where when you start to compound technology [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3415.66s)]
*  at the rate of 24 hours or 48 hours, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3417.5s)]
*  which we've never really had to acknowledge, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3420.14s)]
*  most people's brains break [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3422.1s)]
*  and they don't understand what six months from now looks like. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3423.46s)]
*  And six months from now, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3426.14s)]
*  when you're compounding at 48 or 72 hours [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3427.66s)]
*  is like 10 to 12 years in other technology solutions. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3430.5s)]
*  This is compounding. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3434.94s)]
*  This is different because of the compounding. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3435.82s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3437.58s)]
*  The pace of evolution is very fast. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3438.42s)]
*  We are on a bullet train to something [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3440.38s)]
*  and we don't know exactly what it is. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3442.46s)]
*  And that's disconcerting. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3443.78s)]
*  However, let me tell you what would happen [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3445.3s)]
*  if we create a new regulatory body like the FDA [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3446.86s)]
*  to regulate this. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3448.86s)]
*  They would have no idea how to arbitrate [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3450.1000000000004s)]
*  whether a technology should be approved or not. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3452.78s)]
*  Development will basically slow to a crawl [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3455.3s)]
*  just like drug development. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3457.34s)]
*  There is no double blind standard. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3458.6600000000003s)]
*  I agree. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3460.1400000000003s)]
*  What self-regulation can we do? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3460.98s)]
*  What self-regulation can we do? [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3462.26s)]
*  There is no double blind standard in AI [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3463.34s)]
*  that everyone can agree on right now [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3465.82s)]
*  to know whether somebody should be approved. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3467.86s)]
*  And what's gonna happen is the thing [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3469.5400000000004s)]
*  that's made software development so magical [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3471.0600000000004s)]
*  and allowed all this innovation over the last 25 years [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3473.22s)]
*  is permissionless innovation. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3476.74s)]
*  Any developer, any dropout from a university [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3478.7799999999997s)]
*  can go create their own project, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3482.66s)]
*  which turns into a company. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3484.58s)]
*  And that is what has driven all the innovation [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3486.62s)]
*  and progress in our economy over the last 25 years. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3488.8599999999997s)]
*  So you're gonna replace permissionless innovation [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3491.62s)]
*  with going to Washington [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3493.7s)]
*  to go through some approval process. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3494.8199999999997s)]
*  And it will be the politically connected, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3496.58s)]
*  it'll be the big donors who get their projects approved. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3498.74s)]
*  And the next Mark Zuckerberg, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3501.94s)]
*  who's trying to do his little project in a dorm room [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3503.38s)]
*  somewhere will not know how to do that, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3505.1s)]
*  will not know how to compete [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3507.7000000000003s)]
*  in that highly political process. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3509.1s)]
*  Chamath. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3510.7000000000003s)]
*  I think you're mixing a bunch of things together. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3511.54s)]
*  So first of all, permissionless innovation happens today [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3512.7000000000003s)]
*  in biotech as well. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3516.58s)]
*  It's just that it's what Jason said. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3517.9s)]
*  When you wanna put it on the rails of society [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3519.58s)]
*  and make it available to everybody, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3522.42s)]
*  you actually have to go and do something substantive. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3524.2200000000003s)]
*  In the negotiation of these drug approvals, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3527.98s)]
*  it's not some standardized thing. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3530.1s)]
*  You actually sit with the FDA [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3532.06s)]
*  and you have to decide what are our end points, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3532.9s)]
*  what is the mechanism of action, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3534.62s)]
*  and how will we measure the efficacy of this thing? [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3536.5s)]
*  The idea that you can't do this today in AI is laughable. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3539.5s)]
*  Yes, you can. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3541.86s)]
*  And I think that smart people, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3542.86s)]
*  so for example, if you pit DeepMind's team [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3544.18s)]
*  versus OpenAI's team to both agree [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3547.06s)]
*  that a model is good and correct, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3550.1s)]
*  I bet you they would find a systematic way [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3551.46s)]
*  to test that it's fine. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3554.5s)]
*  I just wanna point out. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3556.14s)]
*  Okay, so basically in order to do what you're saying, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3557.22s)]
*  this entrepreneur who just dropped out of college [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3560.26s)]
*  to do their project, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3563.38s)]
*  they're gonna have to learn how to go sit with regulators, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3564.2200000000003s)]
*  have a conversation with them, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3566.34s)]
*  go through some complicated approval process, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3567.94s)]
*  and you're trying to say that that won't turn into a game [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3570.1800000000003s)]
*  of political connections. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3573.1800000000003s)]
*  Of course it will. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3574.5800000000004s)]
*  Of course it will. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3575.6200000000003s)]
*  Of course it will, but there is a step between it, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3576.46s)]
*  which is self-regulation. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3578.5400000000004s)]
*  Yeah, well, let's get to that. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3580.1800000000003s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3581.3s)]
*  And let's look at the drug approval process. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3582.34s)]
*  If you wanna create a drug company, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3584.7400000000002s)]
*  you need to raise hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3586.5800000000004s)]
*  It's incredibly expensive. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3588.78s)]
*  It's incredibly capital intensive. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3590.2200000000003s)]
*  There is no drug company that is two guys in their garage, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3591.94s)]
*  like many of the biggest companies, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3596.5800000000004s)]
*  like many of the biggest companies [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3598.5800000000004s)]
*  in Silicon Valley started. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3599.78s)]
*  That is because you're talking about taking a chemical [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3601.46s)]
*  or biological compound and then injecting into some hundreds [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3604.82s)]
*  or thousands of people who are both racially, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3608.2200000000003s)]
*  gender-based, age-based, highly stratified [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3612.3s)]
*  all around the world or at a minimum [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3615.86s)]
*  all around the country. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3617.5s)]
*  You're not talking about that here, David. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3618.78s)]
*  I think that you could have a much simpler and cheaper way [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3620.66s)]
*  where you have a version of the internet [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3623.82s)]
*  that's running in a huge sandbox someplace [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3626.62s)]
*  that's closed off from the rest of the internet [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3628.62s)]
*  and another version of the internet [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3630.46s)]
*  that's closed off from everything else as well. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3631.74s)]
*  And you can run on a parallel path as it is with this agent [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3633.74s)]
*  and you can easily, in my opinion actually, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3637.62s)]
*  figure out whether this agent is good or bad, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3640.26s)]
*  and you can probably do it in weeks. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3642.26s)]
*  So I actually think the approvals [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3644.66s)]
*  are actually not that complicated. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3646.34s)]
*  And the reason to do it here is because I get that [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3647.98s)]
*  it may cause a little bit more friction [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3651.7400000000002s)]
*  for some of these mom and pops. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3653.78s)]
*  But if you think about what the societal consequences [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3656.42s)]
*  of letting the worst case outcomes happen, [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3661.6200000000003s)]
*  the AGI type outcomes happen, I think those are so bad, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3664.1000000000004s)]
*  they're worth slowing some folks down. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3669.26s)]
*  And I think just because you wanna buy groceries [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3671.26s)]
*  for $100, you should be able to do it, I get it. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3674.74s)]
*  But if people don't realize and connect the dots [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3677.4599999999996s)]
*  between that and bringing airplanes down, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3679.9799999999996s)]
*  then that's because they don't understand [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3682.18s)]
*  what this is capable of. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3683.58s)]
*  I'm not saying we're never gonna need regulation. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3684.5s)]
*  What I'm saying is it's way too early, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3686.8999999999996s)]
*  we don't even know what we're violating, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3689.1s)]
*  we don't know what the standard would be. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3690.8999999999996s)]
*  And what we will do by racing to create a new FDA [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3692.54s)]
*  is destroying American innovation in the sector. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3694.9799999999996s)]
*  And other countries will not slow down. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3697.74s)]
*  They will beat us to the punch here. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3699.7799999999997s)]
*  Got it. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3701.3399999999997s)]
*  I think there's a middle ground here [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3702.18s)]
*  of self-regulation and thoughtfulness [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3704.34s)]
*  on the part of the people [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3706.34s)]
*  who are providing these tools at scale [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3707.2200000000003s)]
*  to give just but one example here. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3709.38s)]
*  And this tweet is from five minutes ago. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3711.54s)]
*  So to look at the pace of this, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3713.9s)]
*  five minutes ago, this tweet came out. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3715.54s)]
*  A developer who is an AI developer says, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3718.1800000000003s)]
*  AI agents continue to amaze. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3720.58s)]
*  My GPT-4 coding assistant learned how to build apps [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3722.1400000000003s)]
*  with authenticated users that can build and design [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3725.02s)]
*  a web app, create a backend, handle off logins, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3727.1000000000004s)]
*  upload code to GitHub and deploy. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3731.7s)]
*  He literally, while we were talking, is deploying websites. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3734.5s)]
*  Now, if this website was a phishing app [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3738.22s)]
*  or the one that Chamath is talking about, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3740.98s)]
*  he could make a gazillion different versions [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3744.06s)]
*  of Bank of America, Wells Fargo, et cetera, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3746.7799999999997s)]
*  then find everybody on the internet's email, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3749.2999999999997s)]
*  then start sending different spoofing emails, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3751.3799999999997s)]
*  determine which spoofing emails work, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3753.66s)]
*  iterate on those and create a global financial collapse. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3755.2999999999997s)]
*  Now this sounds insane, but it's happening right now. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3758.06s)]
*  People get hacked every day at one, two, 3% sacks. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3761.1s)]
*  Fraud is occurring right now [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3765.58s)]
*  in the low single digit percentages. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3767.02s)]
*  Identity theft is happening in the low single identity. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3768.66s)]
*  Percentages. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3771.74s)]
*  This technology is moving so fast [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3772.8199999999997s)]
*  that bad actors could 10x that relatively easy. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3774.46s)]
*  And so if 10% of us wanna be hacked [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3777.98s)]
*  and have our credit cards hacked, this could create chaos. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3780.2599999999998s)]
*  I think self-regulation is the solution. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3782.94s)]
*  I'm the one who brought up self-regulation. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3785.74s)]
*  What I said is that- [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3787.14s)]
*  No, I brought it up first. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3787.98s)]
*  I brought it up first. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3788.7999999999997s)]
*  I get credit. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3789.64s)]
*  It's not about credit. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3790.96s)]
*  No. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3792.28s)]
*  Self-regulation is the way that I'm chatting to people. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3793.12s)]
*  I never got to finish my point about it [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3794.96s)]
*  because you interrupted me. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3795.8s)]
*  Well, you talked for eight minutes, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3796.64s)]
*  so if you have a point to make, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3797.48s)]
*  you should have got it in the eight minutes. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3798.32s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3799.32s)]
*  You guys kept interrupting me. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3800.16s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3801.56s)]
*  What I said is that there are trust and safety teams [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3802.4s)]
*  at these big AI companies, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3805.44s)]
*  these big foundation model companies like OpenAI. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3807.48s)]
*  Like I said, in the past, trust and safety [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3811.06s)]
*  has been a euphemism for censorship, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3813.84s)]
*  and that's why people don't trust it. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3815.44s)]
*  But I think it would be appropriate [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3816.84s)]
*  for these platform companies to apply some guardrails [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3818.76s)]
*  on how their tools can be used. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3822.48s)]
*  And based on everything I know, they're doing that. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3824.0200000000004s)]
*  So you guys are forecasting- [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3826.88s)]
*  This guy just released websites [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3827.7200000000003s)]
*  to the open web with ChatGP4, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3828.7200000000003s)]
*  and he's gonna have it do it automated. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3830.6400000000003s)]
*  You're basically postulating capabilities [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3831.84s)]
*  that don't yet exist. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3834.88s)]
*  I just tweeted the guy who's doing it. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3836.36s)]
*  He's got a video of himself doing it on the web. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3837.84s)]
*  What do you think, Freebird? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3839.32s)]
*  That's a far cry from basically running [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3840.1600000000003s)]
*  like some phishing expedition [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3842.6000000000004s)]
*  that's gonna bring down the entire banking system. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3845.2000000000003s)]
*  So literally a phishing site [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3847.72s)]
*  and a site with OAuth are the same thing. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3849.7599999999998s)]
*  Go ahead, Freebird. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3851.3599999999997s)]
*  I think that that guy is doing something illegal [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3852.2s)]
*  if he's hacking into computers, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3856.3999999999996s)]
*  into people's emails and bank accounts. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3859.3199999999997s)]
*  That's illegal. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3861.2s)]
*  You're not allowed to do that. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3862.04s)]
*  And so that action breaks the law. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3864.04s)]
*  That person can be prosecuted for doing that. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3866.7999999999997s)]
*  The tooling that one might use to do that [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3869.96s)]
*  can be used in a lot of different ways. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3872.7599999999998s)]
*  Just like you could use Microsoft Word to forge letters, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3875.16s)]
*  just like you could use Microsoft Excel [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3879.52s)]
*  to create fraudulent financial statements, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3882.2799999999997s)]
*  I think that the application of a platform technology [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3884.24s)]
*  needs to be distinguished from the technology itself. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3888.2799999999997s)]
*  And while we all feel extraordinarily fearful [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3892.72s)]
*  because the unbelievable leverage [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3895.04s)]
*  that these AI tools provide, [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3896.7599999999998s)]
*  again, I'll remind you that this ChatGP4 [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3899.48s)]
*  or this GPT-4 model [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3902.48s)]
*  by some estimates is call it a few terabytes. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3905.2799999999997s)]
*  You could store it on a hard drive [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3907.24s)]
*  or you could store it on your iPhone [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3908.48s)]
*  and you could then go run it on any set of servers [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3910.4s)]
*  that you could go set up physically anywhere. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3913.04s)]
*  So it's a little bit naive to say we can go ahead [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3915.12s)]
*  and regulate platforms and we can go regulate the tools. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3918.2799999999997s)]
*  Certainly we should continue to enforce [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3922.2799999999997s)]
*  and protect ourselves against nefarious actors [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3924.44s)]
*  using new tools in inappropriate and illegal ways. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3927.68s)]
*  I also think that there's a moment here [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3932.12s)]
*  that we should all kind of observe [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3935.6s)]
*  just how quickly we wanna shut things down [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3939.2s)]
*  when they take away what feels like the control [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3942.08s)]
*  that we all have from one day to the next. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3948.12s)]
*  And the real kind of sense of fear [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3951.2s)]
*  that seems to be quite contagious [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3956.56s)]
*  for a large number of people that have significant assets [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3958.24s)]
*  or significant things to lose [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3961.6s)]
*  is that tooling that's creating [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3965.04s)]
*  entirely newly disruptive systems [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3968.68s)]
*  and models for business and economics [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3970.56s)]
*  and opportunity for so many needs to be regulated away [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3974.08s)]
*  to minimize what we claim to be some potential downside [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3978.12s)]
*  when we already have laws that protect us on the other side. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3981.72s)]
*  So I just kinda wanna also consider [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3985.64s)]
*  that this set of tools creates extraordinary opportunity. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3989.2799999999997s)]
*  We gave one sort of simple example [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3992.44s)]
*  about the opportunity for creators, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3994.48s)]
*  but we talked about how new business models, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3996.0s)]
*  new businesses can be started with one or two people, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=3998.64s)]
*  entirely new tools can be built with a handful of people, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4001.96s)]
*  entirely new businesses. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4005.0s)]
*  This is an incredible economic opportunity. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4006.3199999999997s)]
*  And again, if the US tries to regulate it [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4008.96s)]
*  or the US tries to come in [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4011.52s)]
*  and stop the application of models in general [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4012.56s)]
*  or regulate models in general, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4014.6s)]
*  you're certainly gonna see those models [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4016.44s)]
*  continue to evolve and continue to be utilized [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4017.92s)]
*  in very powerful ways that are gonna be advantageous [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4020.68s)]
*  to places outside the US. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4023.7599999999998s)]
*  There's over 180 countries on earth. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4025.16s)]
*  They're not all gonna regulate together. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4027.24s)]
*  It's been hard enough to get any sort of coordination [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4029.16s)]
*  around financial systems, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4032.16s)]
*  to get coordination around climate change, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4033.7599999999998s)]
*  to get coordination around anything on a global basis, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4035.4s)]
*  to try and get coordination around the software models [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4038.48s)]
*  that are being developed, I think is pretty naive. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4041.48s)]
*  You don't wanna have a global organization. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4044.08s)]
*  I think you need to have a domestic organization [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4045.72s)]
*  that protects US. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4047.88s)]
*  And I think Europe will have their own. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4049.4s)]
*  Again, FDA versus EMMA, Canada has its own, [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4051.2s)]
*  Japan has its own, China has its own, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4054.64s)]
*  and they have a lot of overlap [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4057.4s)]
*  and a lot of commonality in the guardrails they use. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4059.24s)]
*  And I think that's what's gonna happen here. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4062.12s)]
*  This will be beneficial only for political insiders [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4063.44s)]
*  who will basically be able to get their projects [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4065.84s)]
*  and their apps approved [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4067.68s)]
*  with a huge deadweight loss for the system [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4068.88s)]
*  because innovation will completely slow down. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4070.48s)]
*  But to maybe build on Freeberg's point, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4072.4s)]
*  which is that we have to remember [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4074.6s)]
*  that AI won't just be used by nefarious actors, [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4077.56s)]
*  it'll be used by positive actors. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4080.2400000000002s)]
*  So there will be new tools [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4082.6s)]
*  that law enforcement will be able to use. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4084.08s)]
*  And if somebody is creating phishing sites at scale, [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4086.1600000000003s)]
*  they're gonna be probably pretty easy [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4088.52s)]
*  for law enforcement AIs to detect. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4090.48s)]
*  So let's not forget that there'll be co-pilots written [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4093.4s)]
*  for our law enforcement authorities. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4097.08s)]
*  They'll be able to use that to basically detect and fight crime. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4098.56s)]
*  And a really good example of this was in the crypto space. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4101.639999999999s)]
*  We saw this article over the past week [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4104.08s)]
*  that Chainalysis has figured out how to basically track [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4105.639999999999s)]
*  a list of Bitcoin transactions. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4110.48s)]
*  And there's now a huge number of prosecutions [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4112.5199999999995s)]
*  that are happening of illegal use of Bitcoin. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4114.4s)]
*  And if you go back to when Bitcoin first took off, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4117.599999999999s)]
*  there was a lot of conversations around Silk Road. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4121.24s)]
*  And the only thing that Bitcoin was good for [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4124.04s)]
*  was basically illegal transactions, blackmailing, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4126.16s)]
*  drug trafficking, and therefore we had to stop Bitcoin. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4129.4s)]
*  Remember, that was the main argument. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4132.2s)]
*  And the counter argument was that, well, no, [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4134.16s)]
*  Bitcoin, like any technology can be used for good or bad. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4137.48s)]
*  However, there will be technologies that spring up [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4140.4s)]
*  to combat those nefarious or illicit use cases. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4144.16s)]
*  And sure enough, you had a company like Chainalysis [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4147.4s)]
*  come along and now it's been used by law enforcement [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4149.36s)]
*  to basically crack down on the illicit use of Bitcoin. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4152.32s)]
*  And if anything, it's cleaned up the Bitcoin community [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4155.24s)]
*  tremendously. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4158.08s)]
*  And I think it's dispelled this idea [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4159.16s)]
*  that the only thing you'd use Bitcoin for [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4161.08s)]
*  is black market transactions. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4163.64s)]
*  Quite the contrary, I think you'd be really stupid now [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4164.96s)]
*  to use Bitcoin in that way. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4167.8s)]
*  It's actually turned Bitcoin into something of a honeypot now [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4169.36s)]
*  because if you used it for nefarious transactions, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4172.64s)]
*  your transactions record in the blockchain forever [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4175.92s)]
*  or just waiting for Chainalysis to find it. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4177.84s)]
*  So again, using Bitcoin to do something illegal [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4180.84s)]
*  would be really stupid. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4183.08s)]
*  I think in a similar way, you're gonna see [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4184.28s)]
*  self-regulation by these major AI platform companies [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4186.5199999999995s)]
*  combined with new tools that are used, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4189.639999999999s)]
*  new AI tools that spring up to help combat [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4192.28s)]
*  the nefarious uses. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4195.0s)]
*  And until we let those forces play out, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4196.32s)]
*  I'm not saying regulate never, [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4199.599999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying we need to let those forces play out [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4201.32s)]
*  before we leap to creating some new regulatory body [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4204.4s)]
*  that doesn't even understand [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4207.599999999999s)]
*  what its mandated mission's supposed to be. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4208.639999999999s)]
*  The Bitcoin story's hilarious by the way. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4210.28s)]
*  I haven't read the Wall Street Journal story, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4212.919999999999s)]
*  it's unbelievable. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4214.839999999999s)]
*  It's pretty epic. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4217.08s)]
*  It took years, but basically this guy was buying blow [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4217.92s)]
*  on Silk Road and he deposited his Bitcoin [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4219.96s)]
*  and then when he withdrew it, [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4223.92s)]
*  there was a bug that gave him twice as many Bitcoins [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4226.04s)]
*  so he kept creating more accounts, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4228.08s)]
*  putting more money into Silk Road [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4229.84s)]
*  and getting more Bitcoin out. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4231.48s)]
*  And then years later, the authorities figured this out [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4233.5199999999995s)]
*  again with Chainalysis type things. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4236.2s)]
*  Look at James Zong over there. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4238.719999999999s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4240.28s)]
*  James Zong, the accused, had a Lamborghini, a Tesla, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4241.12s)]
*  a Lake House, and was living his best life apparently [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4244.76s)]
*  when the feds knocked on his door [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4249.360000000001s)]
*  and found the digital keys to his crypto fortune [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4252.4400000000005s)]
*  in a popcorn tin in his bathroom [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4255.92s)]
*  and in a safe in his basement floor. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4258.4400000000005s)]
*  So there you have it folks. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4262.68s)]
*  The reason I posted this was I was like, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4264.280000000001s)]
*  what if this claim that you can have [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4266.04s)]
*  all these anonymous transactions [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4269.92s)]
*  actually fooled an entire market? [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4271.72s)]
*  Because it looks like that this anonymity [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4275.2s)]
*  has effectively been reverse engineered [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4279.360000000001s)]
*  and there's no anonymity at all. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4281.56s)]
*  And so what Bitcoin is quickly becoming [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4283.12s)]
*  is like the most singular honeypot [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4285.8s)]
*  of transactional information [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4289.84s)]
*  that's complete and available in public. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4292.16s)]
*  And I think what this article talks about [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4294.4400000000005s)]
*  is how companies like Chainalysis [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4296.2s)]
*  and others have worked now for years, [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4298.4400000000005s)]
*  almost a decade with law enforcement [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4301.16s)]
*  to be able to map all of it. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4303.8s)]
*  And so now every time money goes from one Bitcoin wallet [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4305.5199999999995s)]
*  to another, they effectively know [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4309.72s)]
*  the sender and the recipient. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4311.48s)]
*  And I just wanna make one quick correction here. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4312.639999999999s)]
*  It wasn't actually exactly popcorn. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4314.96s)]
*  It was Cheetos spicy flavored popcorn. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4318.04s)]
*  And there's the tin of it [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4321.72s)]
*  where he had a motherboard of a computer that held the keys. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4323.8s)]
*  Is there a chance that this project [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4326.08s)]
*  was actually introduced by the government to be a honeypot? [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4328.8s)]
*  I mean, there's been reports of TOR, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4331.4800000000005s)]
*  the anonymous TOR network [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4333.2s)]
*  that the CIA had their hands all over TOR, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4335.72s)]
*  T-O-R if you don't know it, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4338.4400000000005s)]
*  which is an anonymous like multi-relay [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4339.52s)]
*  peer-to-peer web browsing system. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4342.360000000001s)]
*  And people believe it's a CIA honeypot, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4344.64s)]
*  an intentional trap for criminals [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4349.08s)]
*  to get themselves caught up in. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4351.4400000000005s)]
*  All right, as we wrap here, what an amazing discussion. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4355.96s)]
*  My Lord, I never thought I would be. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4358.04s)]
*  I wanna say one thing. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4360.12s)]
*  Yes. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4361.52s)]
*  We saw that someone was arrested [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4362.64s)]
*  for the murder of Bob Lee. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4366.08s)]
*  That's what I was about to answer. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4367.92s)]
*  This morning, yeah, which it turns out [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4368.76s)]
*  that the report of the SFPD's arrest [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4370.84s)]
*  is that it's someone that he knew [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4373.72s)]
*  that also works in the tech industry. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4375.34s)]
*  Someone that none of us know. Possibly, right. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4376.84s)]
*  So still breaking news. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4378.16s)]
*  Yes, possibly. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4379.32s)]
*  But I wanna say two things. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4381.2s)]
*  One, obviously based on this arrest and the storyline, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4382.72s)]
*  it's quite different than what we all assumed it to be, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4385.8s)]
*  which was some sort of homeless robbery type moment [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4389.16s)]
*  that has become all too commonplace in SF. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4392.16s)]
*  It's a commentary for me on two things. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4395.88s)]
*  One is how quick we all were to kind of judge and assume [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4397.96s)]
*  that a homeless robber type person would do this in SF, [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4402.320000000001s)]
*  which I think speaks to the condition in SF right now. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4407.28s)]
*  Also speaks to our conditioning [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4410.58s)]
*  that we all kind of lacked [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4412.08s)]
*  or didn't even want to engage in a conversation [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4414.2s)]
*  that maybe this person was murdered by someone that they knew [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4416.4s)]
*  because we wanted to kind of very quickly [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4420.96s)]
*  fill our own narrative about how bad SF is. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4422.4s)]
*  And that's just something that I really felt [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4425.32s)]
*  when I read this this morning. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4426.679999999999s)]
*  I was like, man, like I didn't even consider the possibility [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4427.639999999999s)]
*  that this guy was murdered by someone that he knew [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4431.0s)]
*  because I am so enthralled right now by this narrative [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4433.48s)]
*  that SF is so bad and it must be another data point [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4436.48s)]
*  that validates my point of view on SF. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4438.88s)]
*  So, you know, I kind of wanna just acknowledge that [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4440.96s)]
*  we all kind of do that right now. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4443.32s)]
*  But I do think it also does in fact, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4445.28s)]
*  unfortunately speak to how bad things are in SF [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4447.0s)]
*  because we all have these experiences [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4449.16s)]
*  of feeling like we're in danger and under threat all the time [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4452.2s)]
*  we're walking around in SF. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4454.52s)]
*  In so many parts of San Francisco, I should say, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4456.32s)]
*  where things feel like they've gotten really bad. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4458.72s)]
*  I think both things can be true [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4461.28s)]
*  that we can kind of feel biased and fill our own narrative [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4462.96s)]
*  by kind of latching onto our assumption [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4468.08s)]
*  about what something tells us. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4470.04s)]
*  But it also tells us quite a lot [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4472.5599999999995s)]
*  about what is going on in SF. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4473.84s)]
*  So I just wanted to make that point. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4475.0s)]
*  In fairness, and I think it's fine for you [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4476.96s)]
*  to make that point. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4478.32s)]
*  I am extremely vigilant on this program [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4479.639999999999s)]
*  to always say when something is breaking news, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4482.32s)]
*  withhold judgment, whether it's the Trump case [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4484.12s)]
*  or Jesse Smollett or anything in between, January 6th, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4486.16s)]
*  let's wait until we get all the facts. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4489.32s)]
*  And in fact, quote from Saks, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4490.679999999999s)]
*  we don't know exactly what happened yet. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4493.88s)]
*  Correct. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4496.599999999999s)]
*  Literally Saks started with that. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4497.639999999999s)]
*  We do that every fucking time on this program. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4499.4s)]
*  We know when there's breaking news to withhold judgment, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4502.799999999999s)]
*  but you can also know two things can be true, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4505.96s)]
*  a tolerance for ambiguity is necessary. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4509.5199999999995s)]
*  But I'm saying I didn't even do that. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4512.08s)]
*  As soon as I heard this, I was like, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4513.639999999999s)]
*  oh, a homeless person's down there. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4515.28s)]
*  That's a fine assumption. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4516.12s)]
*  But David, that is a fine assumption to make. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4517.5199999999995s)]
*  That's a fine assumption to make. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4520.2s)]
*  I think it's a logical assumption. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4521.04s)]
*  Listen. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4522.08s)]
*  You made that assumption for your own protection. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4522.92s)]
*  We got all these reporters who are basically propagandists [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4525.4s)]
*  trying to claim that crime is down in San Francisco. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4528.16s)]
*  They're all basically seeking comment from me this morning, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4529.92s)]
*  sending emails, they're trying to dunk on us [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4532.599999999999s)]
*  because we basically talked about the Bob Lee case [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4535.04s)]
*  in that way. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4538.12s)]
*  Listen, we said that we didn't know what happened, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4539.12s)]
*  but if we were to bet, at least what I said, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4543.0s)]
*  is I bet this case, it looks like the Brianna Kupfer case. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4545.599999999999s)]
*  That was logical. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4549.0s)]
*  That's not conditioning or bias, that's logic. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4550.08s)]
*  And you need to look at what else happened that week. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4552.48s)]
*  Okay, so just the same week that Bob Lee was killed, [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4555.64s)]
*  let me give you three other examples of things [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4559.280000000001s)]
*  that happened in Gotham City, AKA San Francisco. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4561.400000000001s)]
*  So number one, former fire commissioner, Don Carmignani, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4564.400000000001s)]
*  was beaten within an inch of his life [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4569.0s)]
*  by a group of homeless addicts in the marina. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4571.08s)]
*  And one of them was interviewed in terms of why it happened. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4574.240000000001s)]
*  And basically, Don came down from his mother's house [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4577.56s)]
*  and told them to move off his mother's front porch [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4580.96s)]
*  because they were obstructing her ability [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4583.64s)]
*  to get in and out of her apartment. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4585.08s)]
*  They interpreted that as disrespect, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4586.5599999999995s)]
*  and they beat him with a tire iron or a metal pipe. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4588.68s)]
*  And one of the hoodlums who was involved in this, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4591.5599999999995s)]
*  apparently, admitted this. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4594.76s)]
*  Yeah, play the video. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4596.32s)]
*  Somebody over the head like that and attack him. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4597.4s)]
*  Because he was disrespectful. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4599.92s)]
*  Who was disrespectful? [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4604.32s)]
*  There was a big old, kind of bald-haired old man. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4605.68s)]
*  Don, Don, so he was being disrespectful. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4609.6s)]
*  But is that enough to beat him up? [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4612.72s)]
*  Yeah, sometimes. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4615.88s)]
*  Oh, my Lord, I mean. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4617.4800000000005s)]
*  So this is case number one. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4619.04s)]
*  And apparently, in the reporting [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4620.400000000001s)]
*  on that person who was just interviewed, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4622.64s)]
*  he's been in the marina kind of terrorizing people, [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4624.4400000000005s)]
*  maybe not physically, but verbally. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4626.92s)]
*  So you have, you know, bands of homeless people encamped [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4629.92s)]
*  in front of people's houses. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4634.04s)]
*  Don Carmignani gets beaten within an inch of his life. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4635.68s)]
*  You then had the case of the Whole Foods store [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4638.400000000001s)]
*  on Market Street shut down in San Francisco. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4641.4s)]
*  And this was not a case of shoplifting, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4644.32s)]
*  like some of the other store closings we've seen. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4646.08s)]
*  They said they were closing the store [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4648.0s)]
*  because they could not protect their employees. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4649.839999999999s)]
*  The bathrooms were filled with needles and pipes [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4652.639999999999s)]
*  that were drug paraphernalia. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4655.799999999999s)]
*  You had drug addicts going in there using it. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4656.96s)]
*  They were engaging in altercations with store employees. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4659.28s)]
*  And Whole Foods felt like they had to close the store [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4662.88s)]
*  because, again, they could not protect their employees. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4664.599999999999s)]
*  Third example, board of supervisors [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4667.599999999999s)]
*  had to disband their own meeting [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4670.0s)]
*  because their internet connection got vandalized. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4672.12s)]
*  The fiber for the cable connection [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4675.52s)]
*  to provide their internet got vandalized [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4678.2s)]
*  so they had to basically disband their meeting. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4680.2s)]
*  Aaron Preskin was the one who announced this. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4681.76s)]
*  And you saw in the response to this, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4683.72s)]
*  yeah, my retweeting him went viral. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4686.28s)]
*  There were lots of people who said, [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4688.76s)]
*  yeah, I've got a small business [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4689.6s)]
*  and the fiber or the copper wire, whatever, was vandalized. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4690.88s)]
*  And in a lot of cases, I think it's basically drug addicts [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4694.84s)]
*  stealing whatever they can. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4697.16s)]
*  They steal $10 of copper wire, sell that to get a hit, [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4698.16s)]
*  and it causes $40,000 of property damage. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4702.2s)]
*  Here's the insincerity, Sax. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4704.68s)]
*  Literally, the proper response [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4706.96s)]
*  when there's violence in San Francisco is, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4709.16s)]
*  hey, we need to make this place less violent. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4711.5199999999995s)]
*  Is there a chance that it could be people who know each other? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4713.24s)]
*  Of course, that's inherent in any crime that occurs [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4715.92s)]
*  that there'll be time to investigate it. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4718.88s)]
*  But literally, the press is now using this [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4720.68s)]
*  as a moment to say there is no crime in San Francisco [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4723.44s)]
*  where that people are reacting. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4726.6s)]
*  And I just have the New York Times email me [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4727.56s)]
*  during the podcast, Heather Knight from the San Francisco [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4729.64s)]
*  Chronicle, in light of the Bob Lee killing [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4733.4400000000005s)]
*  appearing to be an interpersonal dispute, [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4735.96s)]
*  she still doesn't know, right? [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4737.92s)]
*  We don't have all the facts. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4738.92s)]
*  With another tech leader, do you think the tech community [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4740.240000000001s)]
*  jumped to conclusions? [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4742.52s)]
*  Why are so many tech leaders painting San Francisco [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4743.400000000001s)]
*  as a dystopian hellscape with the reality is more nuanced? [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4746.320000000001s)]
*  I think it's a little typo there. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4750.72s)]
*  When the reality is- [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4751.56s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4753.0s)]
*  It's like, of course the reality is nuanced. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4753.84s)]
*  Of course it's a hellscape. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4755.92s)]
*  Walk down the street, Heather. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4758.4s)]
*  Can I give you a theory? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4760.92s)]
*  Please. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4762.2s)]
*  I think it was most evident in the way that Elon [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4763.88s)]
*  dismantled and manhandled the BBC reporter. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4768.28s)]
*  Oh my God, that was brutal. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4771.28s)]
*  This is a small microcosm of what I think media is. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4773.56s)]
*  So I used to think that media had an agenda. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4777.04s)]
*  I actually now think that they don't particularly [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4782.36s)]
*  have an agenda other than to be relevant [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4785.12s)]
*  because they see waning relevance. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4788.76s)]
*  And so I think what happens is whenever there are [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4791.92s)]
*  a bunch of articles that tilt the pendulum into a narrative, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4794.88s)]
*  they all of a sudden become very focused [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4800.04s)]
*  on refuting that narrative. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4802.5599999999995s)]
*  And even if it means they have to lie, they'll do it. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4805.48s)]
*  Right, so I think for months and months, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4809.72s)]
*  I think people have seen that the quality [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4811.72s)]
*  of the discourse on Twitter became better and better. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4814.16s)]
*  Elon was doing a lot with bots and all of this stuff, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4817.2s)]
*  cleaning it up. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4819.36s)]
*  And this guy had to try to establish the counter-narrative [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4821.08s)]
*  and was willing to lie in order to do it [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4825.44s)]
*  and then he was dismantled. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4827.04s)]
*  Here, you guys, I don't have a bone to pick [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4828.48s)]
*  so much with San Francisco. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4831.08s)]
*  I think I've been relatively silent on this topic, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4832.36s)]
*  but you guys as residents and former residents, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4834.28s)]
*  I think have a vested interest in the quality of that city [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4837.2s)]
*  and you guys have been very vocal. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4839.4s)]
*  But I think that you're not the only ones. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4841.24s)]
*  Michelle Tandler, Schellenberger, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4842.96s)]
*  there's a bunch of smart, thoughtful people [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4845.0s)]
*  who've been beating this drum, Gary Tan. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4847.84s)]
*  And so now, I think reporters don't want to write [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4851.96s)]
*  the N plus first article saying that San Francisco [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4854.76s)]
*  is a hellscape, so they have to take the other side. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4856.96s)]
*  And so now they're gonna go and kick up the counter-narrative [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4860.72s)]
*  and they'll probably dismantle the truth [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4863.2s)]
*  and kind of redirect it in order to do it. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4865.92s)]
*  So I think that what you're seeing is [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4868.2s)]
*  they'll initially tell a story, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4871.28s)]
*  but when there's too much of the truth, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4872.759999999999s)]
*  they'll go to the other side [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4874.719999999999s)]
*  because that's the only way to get clicks and be seen. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4875.8s)]
*  So I think that that's what you guys are a part of right now. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4878.36s)]
*  They are in the business of protecting the narrative, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4880.5199999999995s)]
*  but I do think there's a huge ideological component [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4882.599999999999s)]
*  to the narrative, both in the Elon case [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4884.84s)]
*  where they're trying to claim that there was a huge rise [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4886.96s)]
*  in hate speech on Twitter. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4889.8s)]
*  The reason they're saying that is because [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4890.759999999999s)]
*  they want Twitter to engage in more censorship. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4892.5599999999995s)]
*  That's the ideological agenda here. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4895.599999999999s)]
*  The agenda is this radical agenda of decarceration. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4897.92s)]
*  They actually believe that more and more people [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4901.76s)]
*  should be let out of prison. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4903.8s)]
*  And so therefore they have an incentive [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4904.92s)]
*  to deny the existence of crime in San Francisco [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4907.84s)]
*  and the rise in crime in San Francisco. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4912.4800000000005s)]
*  If you poll most people in San Francisco, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4914.400000000001s)]
*  large majorities in San Francisco [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4916.72s)]
*  believe that crime is on the rise [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4918.12s)]
*  because they can see it, they hear it. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4919.4800000000005s)]
*  And what I would say is, look, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4921.28s)]
*  I think there's a pyramid of activity, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4922.400000000001s)]
*  a pyramid of criminal or antisocial behavior [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4925.8s)]
*  in San Francisco that we can all see. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4928.88s)]
*  The base level is you've got a level of chaos on the streets [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4931.320000000001s)]
*  where you have open air drug markets, people doing drugs. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4935.0s)]
*  Sometimes you'll see a person doing something disgusting, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4938.4800000000005s)]
*  like people defecating on the streets or even worse. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4942.400000000001s)]
*  Then there's a level up where they're chasing after you [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4945.52s)]
*  or harassing you. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4947.68s)]
*  People have experienced that. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4948.88s)]
*  I've experienced that. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4950.320000000001s)]
*  Then there's a level up where there's petty crime [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4951.6s)]
*  that your car gets broken into or something like that. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4954.08s)]
*  Then there's the level where you get mugged. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4957.04s)]
*  And then finally the top of the pyramid [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4959.36s)]
*  is that there's a murder. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4961.08s)]
*  And it's true that most of the time, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4962.76s)]
*  the issues don't go all the way to the top of the pyramid [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4965.12s)]
*  where someone is murdered. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4967.64s)]
*  But that doesn't mean there's not a vast pyramid [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4969.36s)]
*  underneath that of basically quality of life issues. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4971.92s)]
*  And I think this term quality of life was originally used [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4976.0s)]
*  as some sort of way to minimize the behavior [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4979.8s)]
*  that was going on, saying that they weren't really crimes. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4984.320000000001s)]
*  We shouldn't worry about them. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4986.6s)]
*  But if anything, what we've seen in San Francisco [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4988.12s)]
*  is that when you ignore quality of life crimes, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4990.04s)]
*  you will actually see a huge diminishment [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4992.8s)]
*  in what it's like to live in these cities. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4996.72s)]
*  Like quality of life is real. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=4998.92s)]
*  And that's the issue. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5000.360000000001s)]
*  And I think what they're trying to do now is that, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5001.2s)]
*  say that because Bobbily wasn't the case [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5003.76s)]
*  that we thought it was, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5006.52s)]
*  that that whole pyramid doesn't exist. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5007.4400000000005s)]
*  That pyramid exists. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5010.2s)]
*  We can all experience it. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5011.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5011.879999999999s)]
*  And that's the insincerity of this. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5012.719999999999s)]
*  It is insincere. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5014.839999999999s)]
*  And the existence of that pyramid that we can see and hear [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5016.08s)]
*  and feel and experience every day is why [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5019.16s)]
*  we're willing to make a bet. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5021.599999999999s)]
*  We called it a bet that the Bobbily case [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5022.879999999999s)]
*  was like the Brianna Kupfer case. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5025.48s)]
*  And in that- [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5027.36s)]
*  With a disclaimer, with a disclaimer. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5028.2s)]
*  And we always do a disclaimer here. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5030.2s)]
*  And just to George Hammond from the Financial Times [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5031.799999999999s)]
*  who emailed me, here's what he asked me. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5034.5199999999995s)]
*  There's a lot of public attention lately [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5035.719999999999s)]
*  on whether San Francisco status [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5037.08s)]
*  as one of the top business and technology hubs in the US [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5038.84s)]
*  is at risk in the aftermath of the pandemic. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5040.76s)]
*  Duh, obviously it is. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5042.76s)]
*  I wondered if you had a moment to chat about that [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5044.72s)]
*  and whether there is a danger that negative perceptions [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5046.64s)]
*  about the city will damage its reputation [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5049.4800000000005s)]
*  for founders and capital allocators in the future. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5051.320000000001s)]
*  So essentially, and it says the obviously [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5053.4400000000005s)]
*  a lot of potential for hysteria in this conversation, [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5056.04s)]
*  which I'm keen to avoid. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5058.56s)]
*  And it's like, have you walked down the street? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5059.4800000000005s)]
*  And I asked him, have you walked down the street [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5062.16s)]
*  in San Francisco? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5063.92s)]
*  Jason, the best response is send him the thing [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5065.08s)]
*  that's accent, which is the amount of available [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5067.28s)]
*  office space in San Francisco. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5070.08s)]
*  People are voting companies. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5072.5199999999995s)]
*  Companies are voting with their feet. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5074.16s)]
*  So it's already, if the quality of life wasn't so poor, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5075.679999999999s)]
*  they'd stay. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5078.28s)]
*  This is the essence of gaslighting [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5079.12s)]
*  is what they do is that people who've actually created [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5081.12s)]
*  the situation in San Francisco with their policies, [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5083.76s)]
*  their policies of defunding the police, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5086.08s)]
*  making it harder for the police to do their job, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5088.24s)]
*  decriminalizing theft under $950, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5090.4s)]
*  allowing open air drug markets. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5093.5599999999995s)]
*  The people who have now created that matrix of policies [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5095.2s)]
*  have created the situation. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5097.639999999999s)]
*  What they then turn around and do is say, no, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5099.0s)]
*  the people who are creating the problem [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5100.76s)]
*  are the ones who are observing this. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5102.28s)]
*  That's all we're doing is observing [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5104.599999999999s)]
*  and complaining about it. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5106.24s)]
*  And what they try to do is say, well, no, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5107.72s)]
*  you're running down San Francisco. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5109.0s)]
*  We're not the ones creating the problem. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5110.639999999999s)]
*  We're observing it. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5111.639999999999s)]
*  And just this week, another data point [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5112.48s)]
*  is that the mayor's office said that they were short [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5114.639999999999s)]
*  more than 500 police officers in San Francisco. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5117.48s)]
*  Yeah, nobody who's gonna become a police officer here. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5120.32s)]
*  Are you crazy? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5122.48s)]
*  And there was another article just this week [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5123.84s)]
*  about how there's a lot of speculation, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5125.76s)]
*  rumors are swirling of an unofficial strike, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5128.8s)]
*  an informal strike by police officers [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5131.320000000001s)]
*  who are normally on the force [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5133.64s)]
*  who are tired of risking life and limb. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5135.68s)]
*  And then they basically risk getting [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5137.84s)]
*  in a physical altercation with a homeless person. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5139.96s)]
*  They bring them in and then they're just released again. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5143.400000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot of quiet quitting [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5145.72s)]
*  that's going on in the job. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5147.240000000001s)]
*  It's like this learned helplessness [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5148.72s)]
*  because why take a risk? [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5150.120000000001s)]
*  And then the police commission doesn't have your back. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5151.84s)]
*  It seems like the only time you have prosecutorial zeal [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5154.52s)]
*  by a lot of these prosecutors [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5157.280000000001s)]
*  is when they can go after a cop, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5158.4800000000005s)]
*  not one of these repeat offenders. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5160.360000000001s)]
*  And you just saw that by the way in LA. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5161.8s)]
*  Oh look, motherboard in New York Times [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5163.200000000001s)]
*  just emailed and DMed me. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5165.04s)]
*  And then did you guys say that instead of solving [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5166.400000000001s)]
*  these issues, the board of supervisors was dealing [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5169.280000000001s)]
*  with a wild parrot? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5171.56s)]
*  What was it? [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5173.68s)]
*  What was it in the groups? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5174.52s)]
*  The meeting that was disbanded. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5177.280000000001s)]
*  They had scheduled a meeting to vote [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5178.76s)]
*  on whether the wild parrots are the official animal [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5182.4s)]
*  of the city of San Francisco. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5186.32s)]
*  So that was the scheduled meeting that got disbanded. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5188.759999999999s)]
*  Also, may I just clarify what Chamath [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5192.4s)]
*  was talking about with the Elon interview? [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5194.5599999999995s)]
*  A BBC reporter interviewed Elon and said, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5195.92s)]
*  there is much more race and hate and hate speech [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5198.599999999999s)]
*  in the feeds on Twitter. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5203.04s)]
*  And he said, can you give me an example? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5204.5599999999995s)]
*  And he said, well, I don't have an example, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5206.24s)]
*  but people are saying this. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5207.839999999999s)]
*  He said, which people are saying it? [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5208.679999999999s)]
*  And the BBC reporter said, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5210.08s)]
*  well, just different groups of people are saying it. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5211.76s)]
*  And I've certainly seen it. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5213.56s)]
*  He said, okay, you saw it in For You. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5214.68s)]
*  He goes, no, I stopped looking at For You. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5216.6s)]
*  He said, so give me one example of hate speech [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5218.12s)]
*  that you've seen in your feed. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5221.08s)]
*  Now, without speaking about any inside information, [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5223.2s)]
*  which I do not have much of, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5226.08s)]
*  they've been pretty deliberate of removing hate speech [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5227.72s)]
*  from places like For You. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5230.240000000001s)]
*  And it's a very complicated issue [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5231.52s)]
*  when you have an open platform, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5233.400000000001s)]
*  but people may say a word, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5234.52s)]
*  but it doesn't reach a lot of people. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5237.76s)]
*  So if you were to say something really nasty, [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5239.42s)]
*  it doesn't take a genius to block that [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5241.0s)]
*  and not have it reach a bunch of people. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5243.0s)]
*  This reporter kept insisting to Elon [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5244.72s)]
*  that this was on the rise with no factual basis for it, [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5247.32s)]
*  that other people said it. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5250.0s)]
*  And then he said, but I don't look at the feed. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5251.6s)]
*  He said, so you're telling me [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5253.12s)]
*  that there's more hate speech that you've seen, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5254.6s)]
*  but you just admitted to me [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5256.48s)]
*  that you haven't looked at the For You feed in three months. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5257.36s)]
*  And it was just like this completely weird thing. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5259.92s)]
*  I just had mother- [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5262.2s)]
*  He caught him in a lie. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5263.04s)]
*  He caught him in a lie. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5263.88s)]
*  He caught him in a lie. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5264.72s)]
*  And this is the thing, if you're a journalist, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5265.56s)]
*  just cut it down the middle, [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5267.84s)]
*  come with prepared with facts [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5269.76s)]
*  and stop taking a position either way. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5271.64s)]
*  I want to connect one dot, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5273.88s)]
*  which is that he filled in his own narrative, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5275.8s)]
*  even though the data wasn't necessarily there [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5280.2s)]
*  in the same way that we kind of filled in our narrative [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5283.24s)]
*  about San Francisco with the Bob Lee murder [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5286.22s)]
*  being another example. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5290.4800000000005s)]
*  No, we put a disclaimer on it. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5292.0s)]
*  Immediately put a disclaimer on it. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5294.280000000001s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5296.08s)]
*  We said what we knew, what we didn't know. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5296.92s)]
*  And furthermore, we're taking great pains this week [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5298.52s)]
*  to correct the record and explain what we now know. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5302.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we're being honest. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5305.080000000001s)]
*  He was caught in a lie. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5306.88s)]
*  Is it so hard to be intellectually honest? [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5307.72s)]
*  This is just intellectual honesty. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5310.080000000001s)]
*  Honestly, you're going soft here, Freeberg. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1gMhEUXeNk&t=5312.120000000001s)]
