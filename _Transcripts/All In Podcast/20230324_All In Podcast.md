**All In Podcast:** [March 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc)
*  What are you eating Freeberg? Is that buffalo jerky? What is that? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a red pepper. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2.72s)]
*  It is not the bull tongue. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3.6s)]
*  I didn't have time for lunch. I got pistachios and I got a red pepper. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4.8s)]
*  Oh wait, wait, look at this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=8.24s)]
*  Hey! [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=9.28s)]

*  Let's see! [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=10.78s)]
*  Oh, is that our branded pistachios? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=11.28s)]
*  Aren't these the best pistachios? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=13.76s)]
*  They're the best. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Salt and vinegar, yeah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=16.88s)]
*  Salt and vinegar, yeah, yeah, yeah. They're the best. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=17.92s)]
*  Are those unpeeled pistachios? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=19.6s)]
*  These guys are so rich, people peel their nuts. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=22.96s)]
*  People have been peeling my nuts since the Facebook IPO. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=25.28s)]
*  Hey everybody, welcome to episode 121 of the World's Greatest Podcast, the all-in podcast with me [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=30.96s)]
*  again. Of course, the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya, the sultan of science, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=52.8s)]
*  David Friedberg, and the rain man himself, yeah, definitely David Sacks. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=58.8s)]
*  Gentlemen, how are you doing? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  The world's greatest genuflector? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=66.88s)]
*  Strike, strike, strike! [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=68.64s)]
*  The world's greatest moderator is here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=70.56s)]
*  Oh, you guys, I got to tell you something, the grift is on. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=72.47999999999999s)]
*  A lot of corporate gigs for me to moderate. I don't even have to prepare. I just show up and moderate. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=75.84s)]
*  So great. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=81.92s)]
*  What is an example of such a gig? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=82.56s)]
*  There's a lot of corporations and conferences that pay a pretty penny to have the world's [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=85.52s)]
*  greatest moderator come and interview people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  This is like the used car parts association of America having a convention. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=92.0s)]
*  I did one with like a thousand litigators at an attorney conference for like the SAS software [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=96.88s)]
*  they all use and it was a wonderful far side, you know, it's just great. This is like the grift is on. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=101.92s)]
*  Do you have to fly commercial? Or do they fly private? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=107.12s)]
*  It's commercial at this point, yeah. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  What does your rider say? What kind of, do you ask for spice salted macadamia nuts? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=112.56s)]
*  I do not have to peel my nuts, no. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  What I do is I blend the travel costs into the speaking fee and then nobody knows when I'm in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  around what hotel I'm staying at or whatever, but basically I'm back on the road folks. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Do you get like a trailer or do you get, you know? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=131.36s)]
*  No, no, no. What he's saying is, no, what he's saying is he gets a $2,500 travel budget and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=134.16s)]
*  instead he comes the day of and leaves the day of saving and netting himself an extra $2,500. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=139.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, you know, you can optimize. If you're saying optimize, I did use, I had, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  you know, during COVID I racked up a million and a half, two million of these United points [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  and I have just been grinding those United points down. So shout out to United and the pandemic. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=154.72s)]
*  All right. There's a lot of news. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  So you're right, Chamath, it's even worse than that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=161.68s)]
*  It's even worse than that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=163.52s)]
*  He's charging them for travel expenses when he's not even paying anything. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=164.08s)]
*  Maybe Jason's part of the grifters using the cash app to commit fraud and murder. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=166.8s)]
*  I mean, that Hindenburg report is, I mean, it's a work of art, but we got to start with the Fed [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=174.16000000000003s)]
*  hiking rates by 25 basis points and the general feeling in the country that maybe the Fed doesn't [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  know what they're doing and maybe it's time for regime change. The Fed increased rates by 25 [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=188.8s)]
*  basis points yesterday, Wednesday. So the Fed has increased the federal funds rate from nearly [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=194.64s)]
*  zero in March of 2022 to now the range of 4.75 to 5% fastest rate hike since the 70s. Speculation, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=201.2s)]
*  the Fed might pause rate hikes or even cut due to the recent banking failures didn't happen. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=209.6s)]
*  So if you bet that they were going to pause, you were wrong. If you bet they were going to cut, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=218.0s)]
*  you were also wrong. But the market has ripped a bit a day after [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=221.52s)]
*  which people are trying to figure out in the group chats doesn't seem like anybody has [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=228.96s)]
*  a theory here. But let's start with sacks. Maybe an explainer a little bit on how the Fed works. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  There's a board there. People serve a 14 year term. I guess they replace somebody every two years. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=241.36s)]
*  And Jerome Powell was placed in 2018 by Trump. And I guess there's a lot of hand wringing now that [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=249.28s)]
*  they were late on inflation, obviously, and then they went too fast. And maybe now they're not [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=260.32s)]
*  slowing down enough. So what's your take on it objectively? Putting aside partisanship and, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=266.15999999999997s)]
*  this administration versus that administration, just objectively, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=272.32s)]
*  do they know what they're doing? And how could they do a better job? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=275.44s)]
*  No, I don't think they know what they're doing. They clearly reacted way too late to the inflation. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=278.4s)]
*  We've talked about this before. We had that surprise inflation print in the summer of 2021, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=282.4s)]
*  5.1%. They said it was transitory. They didn't react until November. They continued QE for [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=287.2s)]
*  another six months. And they suddenly got hawkish November of 2021. And they didn't even start the [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=294.4s)]
*  first rate increase until March of 2022. So they were really asleep at the wheel and late [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=299.44s)]
*  to react to the inflation by about nine months. Now, I think they're potentially making the [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=306.0s)]
*  opposite decision, which is they are late to recognize what stress and distress the economy [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=311.44s)]
*  is under right now. And Powell had, there was three choices they could have made at this meeting. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=319.36s)]
*  They could have raised rates, which is what they did. They could have cut rates, which they didn't, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=325.52s)]
*  or they could have done nothing, basically held pat. And the argument for raising rates is just [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=329.44s)]
*  that while we have this inflation problem, we need to keep raising interest rates until [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  the rates are above inflation. And that will bring inflation down. Then you can start to lower rates. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  That's sort of the conventional view. I think the problem with that view is it ignores that we've [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=343.52s)]
*  just seen a run of bank failures. And there's tremendous stress building up in the banking [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=349.2s)]
*  system from unrealized losses on long dated bonds, also unrealized losses on commercial real estate [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=354.16s)]
*  loans. And we've barely scratched the surface of seeing that problem. That's, I think, the next [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=361.68s)]
*  shoe to drop in this whole thing. So I think that the right decision here was to either cut rates or [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=366.16s)]
*  to stand pat. You may have seen that Elon said, listen, we should be cutting rates here. There's [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=374.40000000000003s)]
*  way too much latency in this inflation data. The economy is seizing up. And we don't need to be [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=379.12s)]
*  raising rates right now. We actually need to be cutting them. I think that probably, if it were me, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=384.72s)]
*  looking at the upside down side of these decisions, I probably would have just stood pat because, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=390.96s)]
*  again, we've just seen this banking crisis. Why won't you just wait one month to see? Maybe there [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=395.28000000000003s)]
*  is latency in the inflation data. Maybe the banking crisis is not over. Why won't you just [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=400.64s)]
*  stand pat for one month? You can always raise rates in a month. I think that this move here [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=404.56s)]
*  could, in hindsight, be seen as the straw that breaks the camel's back. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  Aaron Norris Schimoth, would you have paused and waited to see another card [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=412.48s)]
*  and then watch the hand developed? Or do you think they're doing the right thing by raising? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=416.88s)]
*  Or should they have cut? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=420.72s)]
*  Michael O'Brien I think they did the worst thing possible, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=421.44s)]
*  which is they took the middle path. If you think about what the Fed [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  has the ability to do, they obviously have the ability to raise and lower interest rates. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=429.52s)]
*  But what we don't talk about is they have a balance sheet that can absorb assets. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=434.64s)]
*  For the last 10 or 15 years, we've had a phenomenon called quantitative easing. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=440.64s)]
*  And for folks that don't understand what that means, that is essentially [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=445.76s)]
*  the Federal Reserve buying assets out of the market and giving people money for it so that [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  people can then go and buy other things with that money. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=456.48s)]
*  Last June, they started what's called quantitative tightening, which is essentially reversing that [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=459.36s)]
*  policy and restricting the liquidity in the system. So if you look at those tools and you [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=466.32s)]
*  sort of play a game tree on what the Fed could have done, I think that you have two choices. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  One is you massively let inflation run amok, where you have no tools to fix, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=481.91999999999996s)]
*  or you have massive illiquidity in the financial system. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=491.76s)]
*  But you actually do have tools to fix that, which is through some combination of quantitative easing [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=497.76s)]
*  and tightening depending on how much liquidity you want in the system. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=502.79999999999995s)]
*  So I think actually I disagree with Sachs. I think they should have done the opposite. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=505.84s)]
*  They should have raised 50 bips. It would have created a little bit more chaos in the short term, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=510.0s)]
*  but it would have set us up to understand what was fundamentally broken and still give the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=518.32s)]
*  Federal Reserve the ability to use their balance sheet and use liquidity in the future to solve [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=524.08s)]
*  the problem. They took the worst option, which is neither did they cut nor did they raise enough. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=529.04s)]
*  And so this problem that Sachs represents actually is the fundamental problem now, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=535.6s)]
*  which is you won't have enough clarity and signal to really know whether this 25 basis point enough. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=540.24s)]
*  Look, I've maintained now for nine months that rates are going to be long, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=546.72s)]
*  higher than we like and longer than we want. And so I think it's high time that we acknowledge [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=551.52s)]
*  that we have a sticky inflation problem whose back we have to break. We've known since Volcker era, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=557.12s)]
*  what we need to do to do that, which is you need to get interest rates to be greater than terminal [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=564.8s)]
*  inflation, which means that a 5% Fed funds rate is insufficient. So we're going to need to see a [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=570.9599999999999s)]
*  print of five and a half, 5.75%. And that's when you're going to have enough contraction. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=577.92s)]
*  And then the Fed can come back with liquidity. But if they don't take these steps, we're going to be [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=584.4799999999999s)]
*  in this very choppy, neither here, neither there situation. And I think that is what causes the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=589.44s)]
*  real damage, because it's the corrosive effects of uncertainty and what that does to lending to risk [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=595.84s)]
*  taking. And I think is really bad for the economy. Freberg, where do you land? We have Sachs saying [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=602.0s)]
*  they should have stood Pat. Rich Mott saying either go hard, take the medicine. I don't know. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=607.12s)]
*  I'm not like an economist on judging the balance that they're trying to weigh right now. I think [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  everyone's got a different, you can hear a cacophony of opinions on this one. What I'm more interested [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=619.6s)]
*  in is, you know, we talk a lot about the banking crisis underway. And I know we're going to talk [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  about this question on commercial real estate in a minute. But if you look at the yield on the 10 [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=632.08s)]
*  year treasury, I think, coming out of this past two weeks, you know, the yield on the 10 year treasury [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=637.2s)]
*  dropped from 4.1% down to looks like it closed at 3.4% today, nearly a 0.7% decline in the past two [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=645.8399999999999s)]
*  and a half, three weeks. And that's also off of 3.8% since the start of the year. And remember, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=655.8399999999999s)]
*  when we talked about the impact on asset values at banks, I think, if you look holistically at the [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=661.5999999999999s)]
*  roughly $7 trillion of assets held at banks, some, you know, whatever the set of banks that [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=669.12s)]
*  we looked at, the average kind of equity ratio is about 15%. So, you know, a 2% or sorry, a 3% [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=676.16s)]
*  adjustment over 10 years on the treasury impacts the value of a chunk of that portfolio down 25%, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  which starts to put you into dangerous territory. And there's obviously a distribution [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=692.48s)]
*  of what that does to certain banks that are overweight, you know, 10 year bonds, whether [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=697.1999999999999s)]
*  they're loan obligations on mortgages or treasuries, or corporate bonds or real estate bonds, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=701.84s)]
*  a real estate debt. And so the more encouraging point that I think we should pay attention to [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=707.76s)]
*  is, does the market tell us that these short term rate actions are driving down the long the medium [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=714.16s)]
*  and longer term rates in a way that will improve the balance sheets of all these institutions that [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=722.8s)]
*  own a lot of this debt, particularly the banks and funds and so on. And, you know, I'll do the [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=729.3599999999999s)]
*  math here real quick. But just in the last two weeks, the impact on the 10 year treasury has [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=735.12s)]
*  probably had a pretty sizable impact. You know, we talked about unrealized losses, it's reduced [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=739.04s)]
*  those unrealized losses, it's improved them. So I think that that's like the more important metric [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=743.68s)]
*  to be tracking is, you know, if you look at all the assets that we're all worried about right now, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=748.88s)]
*  are they going up in value or down in value in a way that introduces more stability into these kind [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=754.8s)]
*  of banking systems that we care about. And I think right now it looks like maybe things are improving. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=760.48s)]
*  And that might be part of the optimism around, you know, equity markets and folks buying and so on. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=765.84s)]
*  Yeah. And so this is, I guess, where people have started to talk about the next shoe to drop, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=770.0s)]
*  we obviously had this time based liquidity issues with Silicon Valley Bank. Now the [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=774.72s)]
*  Wall Street Journal is talking about commercial real estate and how much debt there is. Since [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=781.84s)]
*  COVID, obviously, people are doing more remote work. A lot of the skyscrapers, it's not just [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=786.24s)]
*  San Francisco, but in many locations remain empty or underutilized. People are now having [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=791.28s)]
*  their leases come up. Every year, more and more of these leases will [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=797.36s)]
*  become vacant. And then we'll see if these buildings are worth what people paid for them. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=801.76s)]
*  Smaller banks hold around 2.3 trillion in commercial and real estate debt, including rental [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=808.56s)]
*  apartment mortgages. Almost 80% of commercial mortgages are held by banks, according to this [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=812.3199999999999s)]
*  Wall Street Journal story. Sachs, you are an owner of some commercial real estate, and you play in [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=816.8s)]
*  the space. You have a lot of firsthand knowledge. What is your, putting aside your personal holdings [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=822.8s)]
*  or exposure, what is your take on what you're seeing? What is the game on the field right now [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=829.2s)]
*  in terms of commercial real estate in San Francisco and beyond? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=833.6s)]
*  Well, if you talk to the commercial real estate guys, they'll tell you that the situation is dire. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=836.96s)]
*  Dire. There's two problems. First, there's a credit crunch going on. So there's just no credit [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=841.36s)]
*  available. If you're a commercial real estate developer and you have a building and you want [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=848.32s)]
*  to refinance your construction loan or put long-term debt on a building, you just can't do it. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=853.36s)]
*  I mean, the banks are not open for business. They literally don't want the business. And I think [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=858.24s)]
*  that comes back to the fact that banks right now are hunkered down in an offensive posture. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=863.04s)]
*  They're seeing deposits flee from their banks, unless, of course, you're one of the top four. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=867.92s)]
*  Does that freeze on the banks' predate, the Silicon Valley bank crisis, and it was exacerbated? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=872.56s)]
*  Were people having a hard time getting loans before that? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=879.12s)]
*  It predates it, but definitely what you saw with SVB and these other banks, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=884.24s)]
*  including Credit Suisse, is that banks now are getting much more paranoid. And that's why you [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=889.12s)]
*  saw that if you look at the discount window, which is when the banks go to the Fed as lender of last [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=894.32s)]
*  resorts and basically post-collateral to get liquidity, we had the biggest spike in discount [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=902.56s)]
*  window borrowing since the 2008 financial crisis. Yeah, that line on the right side, that is a spike [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=909.04s)]
*  in one week's borrowing. This exceeds anything that happened in 2008. The warning signs should [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=916.0s)]
*  be flashing red over something like this. Now, to bring it back to- [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=921.76s)]
*  And to be clear, that's banks who have real estate exposure going to the Fed, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=925.68s)]
*  going to the government and saying, hey, can we get some money to cover these? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=930.48s)]
*  It's not specifically about real estate. It's more about bank liquidity. The banks are saying, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=933.9200000000001s)]
*  we don't have enough liquidity right now to cover our needs, which are highly volatile right now, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=938.0s)]
*  because basically depositors are moving out of community and regional and small banks into the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=944.08s)]
*  big four so-called systemically important or SIP banks. So what's happening is that, again, banks [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=950.96s)]
*  are hunkering down. They're getting very defensive. They do not want to make new loans [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=958.48s)]
*  because they can't tie up assets. They are trying to stay liquid themselves. So that's what's [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=962.64s)]
*  happening now with respect to new lending. And then on the other side of it, you have existing [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=967.84s)]
*  loan portfolios. There's something like $20 trillion of commercial real estate debt. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=974.72s)]
*  And most commercial real estate lending is done by small banks, by community banks. So they are [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=979.36s)]
*  sitting on these huge CRE loan portfolios. And I think something like $300 billion needs to be [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=985.6s)]
*  refinanced or is coming due in the next year. Normally, that's rolled over and refinanced. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=991.84s)]
*  There was separately, there was a study showing that unrealized losses in these loan portfolios [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=997.2s)]
*  in the banking system may be around $2 trillion. It was a study that was reported on by the Wall [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1003.0400000000001s)]
*  Street Journal. So in the same way that we had huge unrealized losses in these long-dated bonds, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1007.28s)]
*  I think we also have- At Silicon Valley Bank specifically. That's where we saw- [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1012.96s)]
*  They were the worst offender, but it's a systemic problem. I think similarly, we have [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1016.72s)]
*  huge unrealized losses in commercial real estate loan portfolios. And this is, I think, even a more [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1022.08s)]
*  subtle and pernicious problem because with securities like T-bills or mortgage bonds, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1028.16s)]
*  it's very easy to know what the unrealized losses are. The reason why they hadn't realized the [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1034.08s)]
*  losses was not because they didn't know what they were. It was because of a stupid accounting rule [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1039.04s)]
*  that said they didn't have to realize the losses if they were, quote unquote, holding them to [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1042.48s)]
*  maturity. With these loan portfolios, we don't know how big the exposure is. And we won't know [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1046.64s)]
*  until you start seeing some defaults and repricings of assets and you actually see- [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1052.8s)]
*  Commercial real estate is a much more dynamic market. You have to have a buyer there. You have [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1058.08s)]
*  leases. You have leases coming off at different times. You have subleases occurring. And you have [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1063.04s)]
*  the owners of them flipping them and refinancing them constantly to buy new buildings. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1068.32s)]
*  And those loans aren't as liquid, right? With a mortgage bond, those are basically a bunch of [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1074.3999999999999s)]
*  loans, mortgages typically that have been packaged up and turned into a security and there's liquid [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1080.72s)]
*  marketplace to trade them. In the case of these loan portfolios, there may not be a liquid [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1085.84s)]
*  marketplace. So you don't really know how impaired that loan portfolio is until you actually [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1089.9199999999998s)]
*  get to a place where- When will we know? Because that's the thing I'm wondering. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1095.44s)]
*  I saw a lot of headlines. Pinterest bought themselves out of their new headquarters in [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1100.56s)]
*  the Bay Area, San Francisco, I believe specifically. I heard Facebook got rid of a couple billion [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1105.68s)]
*  dollars and wrote down some expansion. Amazon is selling buildings. They had gotten a ton of [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1110.0800000000002s)]
*  buildings. And we saw last week they got rid of another 9,000. They're planning another 9,000 in [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1115.28s)]
*  a riff. And they can't get people to come back to the office. So how bad is the overbuild, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1118.96s)]
*  I guess, is the question. Because that will be the driver of the value of these buildings. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1125.2s)]
*  Because if there's too much supply, then what are these buildings actually worth? Are they worth [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1130.72s)]
*  $90 a square foot? What if Amazon doesn't want more space? You can see it in the credit default [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1134.48s)]
*  spreads of these banks. It's in the water table already. So Nick, you can just throw it up. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1138.88s)]
*  If you look at any bank that's lending and that has a portfolio, this is Deutsche Bank's [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1143.28s)]
*  Euro-denominated CDS. But it's the same for Barclays. It's the same for SockGen. It's the [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1148.88s)]
*  same for a bunch of American banks. There is a risk in the system that Sachs articulated that [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1154.08s)]
*  is now getting priced in. There are all kinds of loans whose payments, which the banks need, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1160.0s)]
*  cannot necessarily be insured, which means that then there could be illiquidity there. There could [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1167.52s)]
*  be a flow of deposits out from those banks, which would then make their ability to pay [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1172.8799999999999s)]
*  their debt holders lower. You also have this complicated issue already, where it's really [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1177.12s)]
*  like the first time in a long, long, long time where debt holders actually got wiped out in the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1183.6s)]
*  credit suisse debacle before the equity holders did. And that's created all kinds of ripple effects. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1188.8799999999999s)]
*  So this credit bubble is here and it's being manifested right now in these very sophisticated [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1196.3999999999999s)]
*  parts of the market. And eventually they'll ripple to the broader economy at large. But [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1205.36s)]
*  how a person feels this is they're not going to be able to get a car loan or a mortgage or the [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1212.48s)]
*  interest rates they pay will go up. And then how bondholders will react to all of this stuff is [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1217.2s)]
*  they'll just start to find different assets, probably the front end of the curve, money market, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1222.88s)]
*  cash, gold, and they'll just abandon all these assets. And then the other problem [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1229.3600000000001s)]
*  is that it's just really, really bad for risk assets. So the things that we invest in, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1235.76s)]
*  Startups, technology companies, either in a world of inflation run amok because the Fed isn't hiking [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1242.8s)]
*  fast enough, which just destroys future cash flows, or in a world where the Fed pivots in a moment [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1249.9199999999998s)]
*  like this. And Nick, you can show the second chart, both result in the same outcome, which is that you [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1257.28s)]
*  just see these massive drawdowns in the value of risk assets. So we're in a really complicated moment. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1262.88s)]
*  And this is why I think, again, the Fed needed to take leadership this past week and actually do [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1273.2s)]
*  the hard work of either cutting 50 bips or raising 50 bips. And this middle path is the absolute worst [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1279.92s)]
*  path because trying to thread a needle in this complicated economy, I think, is just going to [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1288.8s)]
*  be impossible. And then what happens is then the markets move around them, right? The markets have [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1293.04s)]
*  completely said, we now discredit what you did. And they're basically banking that the Fed will [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1298.48s)]
*  be forced to cut rates massively in short course, because the crisis will be so severe that it'll [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1306.64s)]
*  outweigh the risk of inflation. Think about that. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1314.4s)]
*  Aaron Norris Yeah, so all this real estate comes on the market. There's no buyers for it. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1317.92s)]
*  The mortgages are due. Does that mean a commercial real estate owner just basically gets foreclosed [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1324.5600000000002s)]
*  on and they hand the keys back to the bank or the banks, as this Wall Street Journal story was sort [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1329.76s)]
*  of alluding to, that the Fed will say, you know what, we'll just extend, we'll backstop this real [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1334.72s)]
*  estate, which happened in the last bubble, and we hope that over time it works itself out and [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1340.96s)]
*  demand returns. Now, of course, that's different than a post COVID world. So this time could be [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1346.24s)]
*  different. What happens in the case of 2024, 2025, all of these office spaces are returned and the [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1351.68s)]
*  keys are handed back? Jason Bahlstam [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1359.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So, okay, so Jason, you asked a question like how does this problem manifest? Let me [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1360.96s)]
*  describe from the point of view of that real estate owner. There's basically two problems. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1364.56s)]
*  One is that you have a tenant who's in a long term lease, five, seven, ten years, that lease rolls. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1369.36s)]
*  So that lease comes due. Now they don't need the space anymore. We know that, take San Francisco, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1375.04s)]
*  which has got to be the worst market for Syria in the country right now, that's something like [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1380.56s)]
*  30 to 40% of the space is vacant. So that's either space for rent or space for sublease, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1385.12s)]
*  because no one's using it. So they put it back on the market. Well, all those subleases, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1391.12s)]
*  they're still paying rent because they have a contract. So what happens is as those leases [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1395.92s)]
*  roll, now all of a sudden, you don't have to pay rent anymore. So you're going to stop or if you [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1400.96s)]
*  still need the space, you're going to negotiate a much, much lower rent. So now all of a sudden, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1404.24s)]
*  the real estate owner can't make their debt service covenant ratios, the income from the building is [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1409.8400000000001s)]
*  just substantially less. They can't make their debt service. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1415.92s)]
*  Aaron Powell Let's pause on that and explain that ratio to folks. You have a certain amount of debt [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1418.72s)]
*  you own, let's say Salesforce Tower. In Salesforce's case, they're subleasing 125,000 [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1423.2s)]
*  square feet. Let's say they were into that for 500 million. What is this debt service ratio? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1429.44s)]
*  Explain that to the audience. David Tenenbaum [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1433.68s)]
*  When the bank underwrites the loan, they just figure out the interest that you got to pay on [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1434.8s)]
*  the loan relative to the value of the building or the income that it's generating. But all those [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1439.28s)]
*  ratios are upside down now because the value of the buildings, the rent has gone down so much [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1443.52s)]
*  because there's so much vacancy. I mean, when these loans were underwritten, San Francisco had [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1448.32s)]
*  like a 5% vacancy rate. And now it's like 30 to 40%. There are just no tenants. And then, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1452.08s)]
*  you know, in parallel with that, Jason, you've got all these cases where you don't only have tenants [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1458.24s)]
*  or leases rolling, you have loans rolling. You know, again, if the owner of the building [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1463.12s)]
*  has either a construction loan or like a long term debt and that needs to roll, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1467.76s)]
*  they have to refinance it. And if they can even get credit, which they may not be able to because [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1471.6s)]
*  of this crunch, they're going to be paying a lot more for it. So now all of a sudden, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1476.1599999999999s)]
*  the income statement for that building doesn't make sense. Think about it. Your borrowing costs [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1479.6s)]
*  are higher and your revenue is lower. So now all of a sudden, the building is underwater. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1483.9199999999998s)]
*  So where does that end up? Well, they default on the debt and the bank ends up owning the building. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1488.6399999999999s)]
*  So then what happens is you end up with, you know, all of downtown San Francisco owned by a bunch of [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1493.6s)]
*  banks. What are they going to do with it? They don't want to be in the real estate business. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1498.32s)]
*  So they have to fire sale those buildings in a bunch of auctions at rock bottom prices, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1501.4399999999998s)]
*  because by the way, there's no cash or liquidity out there. So who are the buyers? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1506.8s)]
*  Who's the buyer? There are no buyers. We have a 30% vacancy rate. There's no renter. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1510.0s)]
*  So what happens? Detroit? Like, is it just like a dead city? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1515.04s)]
*  And then the tax base collapses the city because so much of the tax base is dependent on, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1519.28s)]
*  you know, real estate. So listen, I think they're going to have to work this out. I don't think [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1523.04s)]
*  they can just let the free market take its course here because you're going to end up with a scenario [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1527.04s)]
*  I just painted. So I think what hopefully would happen maybe is that the banks do some sort of [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1530.88s)]
*  deal with the real estate owners that, you know, they blend and extend or whatever. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1537.5200000000002s)]
*  But in order to do that, they're going to need to be backstop by somebody. And that's the Fed. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1543.0400000000002s)]
*  Freeberg, what are your thoughts? Just writ large, as it were, on the commercial real estate space, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1546.72s)]
*  because it's $90. It was $90 a square foot, right? For Class A sacks in the city. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1551.2800000000002s)]
*  Is that the price? What's that going to be? 60, 70, 80, 90 bucks a foot, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1557.0400000000002s)]
*  depending on what kind of building you're talking about. I mean, you have all these [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1560.72s)]
*  empty office towers. So look, I never invest in office towers. I do small boutique kind of brick [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1563.68s)]
*  and timber spaces in Jackson Square. We're doing okay, because people still want to be in those [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1568.64s)]
*  spaces. But these office towers on Market Street, or in Soma, I mean, which is where all the [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  investment went during the boom, nobody wants to be in those buildings anymore. And it doesn't help [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1579.52s)]
*  that the city has allowed this giant, you know, open air drug market to metastasize right outside [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1584.24s)]
*  their door. Freeberg? Yeah, I think it's inevitable we'll have probably two to three trillion dollars [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1589.76s)]
*  of federal money, you know, spent to backstop and support the asset. I mean, that's the general [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1595.2s)]
*  theme here. In case everyone isn't paying attention at home is that the Fed, the US government will [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1604.16s)]
*  continue to print money and create programs to effectively support asset values such that there [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1611.52s)]
*  is a crippling economic ripple effect. And this is the dangerous debt spiral of debt. And that's why [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1617.84s)]
*  I always talk about how concerned I am about global debt levels and particularly debt levels [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1626.96s)]
*  in the US, but really global debt levels. I'll say the statistic again, and over and over again, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1630.96s)]
*  360% global debt to global GDP. But, you know, even within some of these asset classes, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1635.68s)]
*  a significant amount of debt has been used to fuel asset prices and to fuel equity value. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1642.64s)]
*  And then that equity value gets levered and reinvested. And so the rippling effect in the [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1647.6000000000001s)]
*  economy of declining asset value can be magnified through leverage. And it unfortunately debt in [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1650.88s)]
*  general forces growth. Without growth, debt fails. And so when we've used debt to demand growth [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1659.76s)]
*  on a macro perspective, it causes, you know, significant stress and strain on the system [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1668.24s)]
*  when you're going through periods of like we are right now, which should be natural recessionary [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1673.76s)]
*  effects from COVID and shutting down the economy or natural asset price declines because of that. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1677.84s)]
*  And we can't let it happen because if it were to happen, the rippling effect would be crippling. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1682.72s)]
*  So this is a good example. You'll probably, I don't know what the facility will look like. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1687.2s)]
*  Maybe the government passes some congressional bill that says, hey guys, here's $3 trillion [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1691.04s)]
*  to support, you know, all this real estate. Here's another, you know, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1696.56s)]
*  $2 trillion to support banks and, you know, giving them liquidity. Because the other problem, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1700.64s)]
*  as you guys know, is most people's, most of the population in the US has most of their assets, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1704.8s)]
*  their asset value or their equity value in their home. And those home prices are supported by [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1711.52s)]
*  residential loan programs. And, you know, if you actually have a massive write down of the value [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1717.2s)]
*  of that asset class, that's when, you know, everything kind of falls apart. So, you know, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1723.2s)]
*  we will continue to be buoyed by that kind of inflationary behavior. Unfortunately, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1727.44s)]
*  biology, I think has it right. We'll talk about his dad in a minute. That there has to be money [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1734.0s)]
*  printing to get out of this hole. I don't know if it's necessarily in this moment, hyperinflationary, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1738.56s)]
*  as he predicts. You know, he uses the Deutschmark and the Weimar Republic as this kind of [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1743.44s)]
*  storyline that this is what's about to happen in the US. The truth is, it looks a little bit more [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1748.64s)]
*  like the pound sterling at the end of the British Empire, where, you know, there's certainly an [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1752.8s)]
*  inflationary and devaluation effect that arises, but it's not it is the reserve currency of the [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1758.56s)]
*  world today. Let's say it's really hard to kind of just say, hey, it's going to be hyperinflationary, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1762.72s)]
*  and the value is going to go to zero, it's just not going to happen. So that seems to be the dollar [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1767.04s)]
*  of the dollar. Yeah. So that seems to be the bet now chamoff at some folks are predicting [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1771.04s)]
*  catastrophizing, hey, this is the end of US supremacy, the end of the dollar, of course, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1777.84s)]
*  modern monetary theory seems to stay, you can just keep printing dollars and make a couple [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1783.6s)]
*  trillion dollar coins and backstop it. And by the way, TARP was profitable modestly for the [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1788.0s)]
*  United States and the backstop of real estate totally work. So where do you land on this? Do [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1793.44s)]
*  you think these backstops and modern monetary theory stating that you can just print money, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1797.92s)]
*  you own your own fiat currency is going to work? Or as we pivot to the billion dollar, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1802.96s)]
*  I'm sorry, the million dollar biology Bitcoin bet that this is the end of days? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1808.72s)]
*  I think it's not the end of days. But I think you're conflating a bunch of things together. So look, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1814.64s)]
*  MMP was in hindsight, idiotic in the moment, it never quite made sense. But in hindsight, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1819.28s)]
*  it's clearly idiotic. And I think that we can properly dispense with that. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1827.04s)]
*  But the reason that we print so much money is sort of what Friedbrück says, which is that we just [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1833.6s)]
*  want a well functioning society. And the simplest and shortest way to do that is to make sure that [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1839.52s)]
*  there aren't any winners and losers anymore. And the most effective way to do that in the markets [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1846.96s)]
*  is with money, print a bunch of money, and there are no more winners and losers. And so everybody [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1851.6s)]
*  can kind of win some people may may win more, but nobody really ever loses. So I think that's the [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1856.72s)]
*  that's the mo that we're operating under. The thing is, I don't think that unhealthy to that [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1863.68s)]
*  Chimath, you're sort of a no losers. That's a more philosophical and a commentary on capitalism and [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1870.8s)]
*  a bunch of other things. And you're right, I don't think it makes sense. I do think you need winners [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1877.2s)]
*  and losers to really make society function well. But the other part of it is like, does it reinforce [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1880.64s)]
*  or does it decay us dollar hegemony, and I think it actually reinforces it. And the reason is just [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1888.8000000000002s)]
*  very practically speaking, when you look at how dependent other people other countries are on the [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1896.24s)]
*  US dollar in times of stress, they actually become more dependent. And that has a lot to do with [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1902.48s)]
*  their boring patterns, the amount of dollars central banks need outside the United States. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1908.16s)]
*  And so what did you see in a moment of stress? Actually, the Fed opened up swap lines to all [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1912.5600000000002s)]
*  the central banks that they work with their most important operating partners. So Europe, Canada, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1917.0400000000002s)]
*  Japan, etc. Switzerland, and they move the liquidity window from weekly to daily and they [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1922.96s)]
*  pounded the swap lines. So I don't know, I think that most people that that kind of like it's like [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1929.6000000000001s)]
*  a boy crying wolf, maybe at some point, somebody will be right, but you're going to lose so much [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1934.88s)]
*  money trying to take a point of view around this topic that it's more practical to just look at [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1939.2s)]
*  dollar flows. And dollar flows go up in moments of stress, not go down. And they go up in a [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1944.88s)]
*  distributed manner across the monetary plumbing of the world. All right, so let's explain the [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1951.5200000000002s)]
*  biology bad since that trended and he is the boy poop. As you're saying, what cried wolf this past [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1956.4s)]
*  week? Cry Bitcoin. Yeah, the boy cried Bitcoin very well said. So a friend of the pod apology, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1962.64s)]
*  on March 17, predicted that Bitcoin will reach $1 million in 90 days. Due to US hyperinflation, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1969.6000000000001s)]
*  hyperinflation is defined as prices going up 50% month over month, just so we're clear on [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1979.5200000000002s)]
*  exactly how dramatic that is. He made the bet on March 17 against a pseudo anonymous [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1985.5200000000002s)]
*  Twitter user, James Medlock, who said they would bet 1 million that the US would not experience [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1991.92s)]
*  hyperinflation. So biology sort of inserted Bitcoin into that bet, it wasn't a Bitcoin bet [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=1997.52s)]
*  that and I think he's done two of these bets. So he's betting 2 million in total on Bitcoin [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2003.6000000000001s)]
*  hitting 1 million by June 17, which there's probably no chance of that happening or a very [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2009.04s)]
*  tiny chance. I'll ask the panel in a second. Bitcoin was trading at 25 26,000 at the time, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2014.56s)]
*  it's now trading at over 28,000. And Balaji has been on every podcast known to man in the last [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2019.92s)]
*  72 hours talking about this, I've watched one or two of them. And it's pretty out there argument, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2026.88s)]
*  I think you can just type in biology on YouTube and watch any of the 20 he's done. He believes [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2033.44s)]
*  regional banks are insolvent. He thinks the feds need to is going to need to print a massive amount [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2039.68s)]
*  of money. Like we've said here, do more QE and then cut rates all seems reasonable. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2044.32s)]
*  But that that will lead to hyperinflation. It's not reasonable. Well, it's not that it's reasonable. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2050.48s)]
*  We just print we just printed that they're going to cut rates, we just discussed they're going to [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2056.4s)]
*  eventually cut rates and there'll be more QE. So that part is reasonable, just that one little [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2060.0s)]
*  piece. But then he believes is the part that is kind of out there, that hyperinflation is going to [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2064.24s)]
*  devalue the dollar and this is the time he does not and I made a bunch of I asked him this a bunch [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2069.28s)]
*  of times and he would not be honest about it or didn't want to answer my question. I said, hey, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2076.7200000000003s)]
*  what percentage are you in Bitcoin? Somebody says he's 99% in Bitcoin, he will not confirm. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2081.52s)]
*  And so I was like, well, if you want 1000 bitcoins, if this goes up, you know, a very small amount, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2087.6000000000004s)]
*  four or 5%, you're going to pay for the bets. And are you talking your own book here or not? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2093.44s)]
*  Sax, what do you think of this overall bet? Is it a stunt? Yeah, he's saying like, this is the lifeboats [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2098.48s)]
*  moment. And just to add to it, he says you have to leave the United States and get to Singapore, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2104.48s)]
*  or a place or if you're going to stay in the United States, you need to get to Wyoming or Texas or [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2110.88s)]
*  somewhere that explicitly allows Bitcoin. Because the closer you are to the United States banking [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2114.72s)]
*  system, what happened to Silicon Valley Bank on that fateful weekend where people couldn't get [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2118.64s)]
*  their cash and we're going to have to, you know, miss payroll? He says that's the dry run for the [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2123.68s)]
*  entire US banking system. Sax. So first of all, I don't think you can disparage Balgi because someone [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2129.2s)]
*  who cries wolf says this repeatedly, and it makes a dire prediction repeatedly and is wrong. And we [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2134.64s)]
*  can't say yet that Balgi is wrong. Do I think that we're gonna have a million dollar Bitcoin in 90 [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2140.72s)]
*  days? I personally find that very unlikely. But you can't say yet. He stuck his neck out, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2146.0s)]
*  making a prediction that will be easily falsified if he's wrong. Second, the last time that Balgi [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2152.0s)]
*  made a dire prediction was COVID. And he was right about that one. So you can't say that this is just [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2159.12s)]
*  like a doomer who throws out crazy predictions and is always wrong. He's actually pretty selective [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2165.52s)]
*  about his predictions. There was a tweet from January 30th of 2020, in which he basically [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2170.32s)]
*  predicted a pandemic based on a coronavirus and laid out a whole bunch of consequences [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2177.36s)]
*  that mostly came true. Which is why we're talking about this. This is not just some [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2182.8s)]
*  like random person like he actually has pedigree in a track record. Here's my view on it. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2187.6800000000003s)]
*  In doom and gloom. Him and the two of our opening speakers at all in summit 2023. Those would be our [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2193.6s)]
*  bookhead speakers. Book them now. Anyway, so look now, what do I think about it? I posted my own [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2201.6s)]
*  theory today, which I would call sort of Balgi light. Which is, okay, look, if you think about [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2209.6s)]
*  this spiking interest rates that we've had, and that Tramah thinks why should continue quite a [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2217.8399999999997s)]
*  bit longer, there are three main effects that it indisputably has. Number one, undercuts the value [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2221.2s)]
*  of long dated bonds. Number two, it's made lending much more expensive, particularly for [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2227.36s)]
*  big purchases like real estate. Number three, it's increased government lending costs. Okay, now, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2232.96s)]
*  play that through the financial system. What does that mean? Well, if the value of long dated bonds [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2237.84s)]
*  has sharply decreased, well, that's led to this banking crisis with the unrealized losses. That's [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2242.32s)]
*  already happened. Number two, it's made lending more expensive, the credit crunch and CRE, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2247.76s)]
*  where we need to see that. And I believe that's going to play out as the second crisis of this [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2251.92s)]
*  larger financial crisis. And then number three is the increase in government borrowing costs that [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2256.32s)]
*  will eventually play out in terms of being a government debt crisis of some kind. And I think [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2261.44s)]
*  it'll involve a spike in borrowing costs at the federal level and involve sovereign debt issues [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2266.56s)]
*  internationally. I think it will involve budget deficits at states and cities. So I think there's [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2273.28s)]
*  three phases to this financial crisis. We're in phase one, and I think CRE and government debt are [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2279.2000000000003s)]
*  the next two phases. And I think a lot of that lines up with what Balaji thinks. Where I disagree [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2285.04s)]
*  with him is I don't think we can know what's going to happen in 90 days. I think that the CRE crisis [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2290.48s)]
*  is highly deflationary. It's going to create distress everywhere in the economy. That is going [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2294.8s)]
*  to lead to a massive reduction in liquidity. I think that the government debt crisis, assuming [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2300.32s)]
*  the government wants to inflate and monetize the debt as a way to solve that problem, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2304.8s)]
*  that will be highly inflationary. But when these things play out, we can't know. I think that's [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2310.24s)]
*  what makes this really hard is I think jumping all the way to the finish line and saying we're [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2314.88s)]
*  going to have a million dollar Bitcoin in 90 days because the US dollar is worthless, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2320.96s)]
*  I think that's premature. I think this could play out over the next couple of years. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2324.48s)]
*  We have a real problem if Bitcoin is the exit ramp [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2327.6800000000003s)]
*  for an inflationary crisis because it's not accessible enough. It's not easily transactable. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2333.36s)]
*  I'm sorry to be negative to the Bitcoin maximalists. I'm generally in favor of this [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2340.32s)]
*  kind of independent storage system that's outside of government and state control. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2346.0s)]
*  I think there's just this unfortunate reality. I mean, we saw what the Wells noticed at Coinbase [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2352.08s)]
*  today. They just arrested that crypto guy. Doe Quan was arrested in Montenegro of all places. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2355.44s)]
*  Great country. Kraken won't let you wire money in or out as of I think Monday or Tuesday. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2362.88s)]
*  And so, it's clearly becoming kind of a less accessible system of storage. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2368.0s)]
*  No, what's more accessible? Well, I do think that one of the reasons we're seeing the market move [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2373.92s)]
*  the way it does is because folks are shifting their risk assets around quite a bit right now [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2378.24s)]
*  to figure out where is a good place to put money. I was talking with an asset manager [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2382.64s)]
*  this morning and they had a very strong point of view. Folks are moving capital away from [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2391.12s)]
*  what they think are going to be most impacted by the risk of this kind of massive inflationary [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2397.12s)]
*  event that may arise or this massive banking crisis that may arise or this massive real [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2402.4s)]
*  estate crisis that may arise. And there are other places to then put your capital that's not just [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2406.3199999999997s)]
*  Bitcoin. And sure, maybe some of these things are dollar denominated, but for example, there [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2411.7599999999998s)]
*  are many businesses that sell products in non-dollar denominated currencies globally. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2415.6s)]
*  And while they report and trade on US stock exchanges, you're buying a security interest [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2420.3199999999997s)]
*  in a business that generates most of its income. You're referring to many different companies. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2424.4s)]
*  And so, there are many companies that get the bulk of their revenue, the bulk of their sales [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2430.4s)]
*  internationally. There are also many companies that will benefit in an inflationary environment, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2434.7200000000003s)]
*  businesses that are tied to other types of real estate, businesses that are tied to [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2438.8s)]
*  certain capital equipment where consumption will not go down unless there's significant massive [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2442.88s)]
*  global socioeconomic shock. And so, I think that that's kind of a lot of what's going on right now. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2448.48s)]
*  It's less about, hey, Bitcoin is the only place to go and be safe. And it's more about, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2453.12s)]
*  let me reallocate my risk assets a little bit to places that may benefit from or may be better [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2456.88s)]
*  guarded from a massive kind of inflationary shock. Let me say one more thing. I think one of the [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2464.64s)]
*  biggest risks that is not being talked about is the debt ceiling vote that's due in June. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2471.12s)]
*  In June, Congress needs to pass [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2475.84s)]
*  an increase in the debt ceiling because the amount of debt that the federal government [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2483.6000000000004s)]
*  is going to have to take on in order to meet our budget deficit and refinance our debt and [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2489.76s)]
*  pay our obligations historically means that we're going to have to have more than what we've [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2494.96s)]
*  approved to date in terms of the total amount of debt. Now, this has historically been a last [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2501.28s)]
*  minute vote, crazy dramatic thing that drives markets nuts. The Hill had a public opinion piece [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2505.6000000000004s)]
*  from Peter O'Rourke and Mary Spath, but I think they make a good point. I've talked to a lot of [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2514.0s)]
*  folks who call it in the fixed income market, but also folks who are in the equities markets [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2520.0800000000004s)]
*  publicly who are pretty nervous about the debt ceiling vote. And if it does look like the [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2525.76s)]
*  Republican party takes a very hard line and says, because this is the current party line, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2531.2000000000003s)]
*  if you don't agree to massive deficit cuts or spending cuts and really commit to that [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2537.44s)]
*  in a bill that we can pass that then also approves the increase in the debt limit, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2545.44s)]
*  we are not going to approve increasing the debt limit. And what this opinion piece argues, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2550.1600000000003s)]
*  I think is a very good middle of the line solution, which is, you know, come up with points of view [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2555.28s)]
*  and actually document those points of view on making sure that government spending is [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2560.6400000000003s)]
*  effectively accountable, that there's no more wasteful spending and that there are certain [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2566.32s)]
*  programs that both parties can very quickly agree to as being very wasteful. And if you start there, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2570.0800000000004s)]
*  you maybe get enough across the line that both parties kind of say, this makes sense, let's do [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2576.32s)]
*  this. And then we can kind of increase the debt limit. Because in the absence of that, the US will [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2581.12s)]
*  have to default on debt. This is always the big threats never happened. And if that happens, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2585.6s)]
*  or there is the looming threat of that happening, combined with the banking crisis combined with, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2589.6s)]
*  you know, the liquidity crisis combined with the real estate crisis that may be emerging here. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2595.04s)]
*  Let me ask you a question that you can have things really melt down. So look, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2599.92s)]
*  because I think this is the biggest like black swan, it's not a black swan, but this is the [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2603.7599999999998s)]
*  biggest kind of elephant in the room right now is and I think that and sorry, I think if people [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2607.84s)]
*  in DC could get together today, and if you could instead of doing the typical last minute 24 hour [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2612.4s)]
*  vote, a day before the debt ceiling needs to be increased, be thoughtful and do it. If this could [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2617.84s)]
*  be addressed today, it could start to put in some of the layers of backstop and coverage and [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2622.2400000000002s)]
*  protection and safety that the markets I think really need to manage some of the trepidation in [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2627.1200000000003s)]
*  the weeks and months ahead. I want to jump to the crypto crackdown and get your opinion on that [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2632.8s)]
*  sex horse. But I want to do a clarifying point here with freeburg. You have been in the Ray Dalio [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2636.48s)]
*  end of empires, empires collapse and that hey, maybe the US is winding down its supremacy and [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2641.68s)]
*  biology was pretty much saying, Yep, this is the moment where is there any light between [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2650.2400000000002s)]
*  your position of like, hey, Dalio is correct. This is the end of the empire and biology is like, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2657.28s)]
*  it's the end of the empire right now. Where do you stand on that? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2662.0s)]
*  Freeburg. So I mean, I've always I've been concerned, I've told you guys this for like [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2666.0s)]
*  three years, and I've obviously promoted this book for two and a half years. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2669.12s)]
*  And Dalio's points of view, with lots of kind of empirical wisdom behind it, [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2673.52s)]
*  I think, indicate that the US is on a path and the way we spend and the way we behave, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2678.08s)]
*  we behave, and the way markets are reacting, I think indicates that a lot of what has happened [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2682.08s)]
*  historically is happening now in the US. Now, it doesn't, I don't know if it's going to happen [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2686.32s)]
*  overnight. That's where I would have light with biology. Okay, the notion of kind of hyperinflation [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2693.36s)]
*  again, I think, means that so think about all the US dollar holders around the world. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2698.0s)]
*  It would be a shock for the collective system. It would require the collective system to [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2706.88s)]
*  collectively agree to get off the dollar very quickly for that to really happen. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2712.0s)]
*  In the meantime, I do think there will be a flationary effects. I do think there will be [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2716.88s)]
*  massive kind of asset value shocks. But I'm not sure there's going to be this kind of like [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2720.56s)]
*  Weimar Republic, Deutsche Mark hyperinflation thing, because it is the reserve currency, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2725.76s)]
*  and it is so widely held by everyone. It would require collective giving up. It also seems [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2730.08s)]
*  like there may be you know, we talked a lot about the Petro Yuan trade, which I think is critical [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2736.24s)]
*  to see that actually happen. I think that's going to be the linchpin. Got it. Maybe that [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2739.6s)]
*  catalyzes this. And that seems to be a little bit tightrope right now, too. It doesn't seem [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2743.68s)]
*  super definitive that Saudis are embracing China. There's obviously this behavior with [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2747.7599999999998s)]
*  There's a little saber rattling around that. You know, it's not as definitive right now. I think [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2752.16s)]
*  that looks to happen to kind of really catalyze that. Let's get our tinfoil hats on here for a [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2757.44s)]
*  second. In relation to the biology bet, there has been a lot of action against crypto. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2761.7599999999998s)]
*  Obviously, authoritarian countries took control of crypto long ago, China banning it, etc. North [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2768.1600000000003s)]
*  Korea, other authoritarian places kind of tighten their grip on it. Now here in the United States, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2774.88s)]
*  Coinbase got a Wells notice. That is a warning basically, and giving you a last chance to kind [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2780.7200000000003s)]
*  of respond to the SEC. And this was based on their loaning programs. And on top of that, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2785.6800000000003s)]
*  a number of other crypto crackdowns have occurred. We saw celebrities getting smacked down [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2792.88s)]
*  and getting fines and doing settlements. This has led Saks to a theory that the United States [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2798.64s)]
*  government wants to break the back of crypto. Crypto has done a great job of breaking their [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2806.7999999999997s)]
*  own back with plenty of crypto griffs, insider trading and all kinds of shenanigans with FTX [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2811.92s)]
*  and front running and painting the tape. Any grift or criminal activity possible seems to [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2817.7599999999998s)]
*  have been exploited. Do you think that these two things are in some way coordinated or there's a [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2822.56s)]
*  coordinated effort by the US government to destroy and kill crypto as an off ramp for the US dollar [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2828.56s)]
*  while the US dollar is dealing with these crises? Saks? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2835.2s)]
*  Saks Well, there's a really interesting article that was just published on Substack by Nick Carter, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2837.52s)]
*  I guess a guest writer on Mike Solana's Substack called Pirate Wires. It's a follow-up piece to [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2843.04s)]
*  an article he wrote six weeks ago where he laid out an operation by the Biden administration called [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2848.8799999999997s)]
*  Operation Choke Point, which made the case that the Biden administration was quietly attempting [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2855.04s)]
*  to ban crypto. And now, a month later, there's all these steps that the administration is taking [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2859.68s)]
*  to go after crypto. And he lays out a bunch in a bullet point list. So, the SEC announced a lawsuit [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2868.08s)]
*  against crypto infrastructure company Paxos. Crypto exchange Kraken settled with the SEC. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2874.64s)]
*  SEC Chair Gensler openly labeled every crypto asset other than Bitcoin to security. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2880.24s)]
*  Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing lambasting Bitcoin. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2886.16s)]
*  Biden administration proposed a bill that singles out crypto miners for owner's tax treatment. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2890.3199999999997s)]
*  New York Attorney General declared Ethereum, which is the second largest crypto asset, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2894.88s)]
*  a security. That's a huge change, by the way. SEC continues anti-consumer protection efforts [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2898.2400000000002s)]
*  by doubling down their attempt to block a spot Bitcoin ETF. OCC let Crypto Bank [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2905.36s)]
*  Protegos' application for a national trust charter expire. And then the SEC just sent Coinbase a [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2911.36s)]
*  Wells notice. So, I think it's hard to argue that there isn't a concerted effort now to crack down [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2917.36s)]
*  on crypto by a wide variety of government agencies and authorities, starting with Gensler [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2924.8s)]
*  at the SEC, who seems incredibly hostile to crypto. So, now the only question is, is this correlated [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2931.76s)]
*  with the stress that the banking system is under or is it just a coincidence? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2939.1200000000003s)]
*  And that I don't know, but I think the argument biology would make is that [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2943.6800000000003s)]
*  at the same time, they're going to deflate the dollar, they're going to make it harder for you [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2948.4s)]
*  to find an off-ramp. And he actually brought up a historical example that I wasn't aware of. I [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2951.84s)]
*  think it was called Executive Order 6201, which is FDR, way back in the 1930s, actually had an [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2958.56s)]
*  executive order that confiscated all the private gold bullion in the country. And they seized the [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2964.32s)]
*  gold bullion, making the accusation that private citizens were hoarding too much gold. So, in any [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2970.2400000000002s)]
*  event, this is the theory. I don't know whether it's true or not. It could be a coincidence. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2977.6s)]
*  Chamath, do you think that this is correlated in any way with the crisis or is just the fact [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2983.12s)]
*  that FTX blew up and all these other things blew up and the public is really upset that they lost [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2988.48s)]
*  a lot of money on this and the SEC has got to cover and be a little bit more active instead of [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=2993.04s)]
*  reactive when it comes to dealing with the crypto losses that consumers had? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3000.0s)]
*  That's the latter. I think that there is a rumor going around, I don't know how true it is, that [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3004.16s)]
*  FTX was days away from getting a critical approval by the SEC to actually even further legitimize [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3009.6s)]
*  their US exchange before they went out of business. So, I think Gensler had to pivot very hard, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3018.48s)]
*  from at a minimum being very pro-FTX and there's all kinds of stories about his interrelatedness [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3024.3199999999997s)]
*  with Sam and his family to very anti-Bitcoin or anti-crypto in general. That's clearly happened. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3029.6s)]
*  But look, I think that this is like a lot of tin-hatting, which I don't think is very [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3037.68s)]
*  productive. If you look at the total number of non-zero Bitcoin wallet addresses in the world, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3041.7599999999998s)]
*  and let's be extremely generous and say it's 100 million, there's still 7 billion people in the [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3049.6s)]
*  world. And so, I just think everybody that tries to speak about the fragility of the US and worldwide [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3057.68s)]
*  banking system is right. And that part I think is quite lucid and unemotional. But every time they [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3065.7599999999998s)]
*  try to connect it to Bitcoin, they sound like a crazy person because they're just talking their [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3073.2s)]
*  book. And that is exactly the case, by the way, with this kid Nick Carter. And the best example [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3077.8399999999997s)]
*  to demonstrate this is in all of this chaos, if Bitcoin or crypto assets in general were truly [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3084.4s)]
*  a legitimate off-ramp and salvation from US dollar hegemony and all of this stuff, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3091.68s)]
*  why isn't Bitcoin at least at 35,000 a coin right now? It's barely above 28,000. It really [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3101.44s)]
*  hasn't moved that much. And I think the real answer is that most people in Bitcoin are not [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3107.36s)]
*  trying to hedge their existing fiat currency exposure. They're just picking off people in [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3113.6s)]
*  retail. They're just trading this thing. I mean, how else do you explain an asset that is not [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3120.48s)]
*  absolutely ripped in the face of all of this terrible news about the financial system? And [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3129.28s)]
*  I think the answer is because it's still a cul-de-sac of users. It's not broadly available, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3134.64s)]
*  not broadly adoptable, not broadly used. I still believe that it's valuable. I was the [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3140.7999999999997s)]
*  earliest proponent of Bitcoin, 2011, 2012. So I believe that there's a place for it in one's [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3146.24s)]
*  portfolio. But I just think connecting these dots misses the point. And I think the point [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3153.7599999999998s)]
*  is much, much bigger than a crypto off-ramp. The point is that we have a lot of systemic shocks [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3159.12s)]
*  that are building up in the system. We have broken a ton of the systems that cause the financial [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3165.68s)]
*  infrastructure and the world to work properly. And we are just starting to uncover how they're [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3173.44s)]
*  broken. So I think we need to focus our energy on that and dial down a little bit of the Bitcoin [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3177.7599999999998s)]
*  maxi stuff because it distracts from a really important set of topics that are more inclusive [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3183.68s)]
*  and actually touch 7 billion people. We have to do the cleanup work. And just to be perfectly [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3189.36s)]
*  clear here, Nick Carter is a career crypto. He's on his third fund, his $250 million third fund, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3194.56s)]
*  according to a quick Google search. He's a partner at Castle Island Ventures. And I believe Bology [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3203.2s)]
*  believes what he's saying and at the same time is massively in Bitcoin and the $2 million he'll [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3208.24s)]
*  obviously lose in this bet or the 99.9% chance. And he said that already. I think he believes [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3215.84s)]
*  he's doing a service just like he did believe he was doing a service with COVID. So I do not doubt [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3221.92s)]
*  his intent. But I believe his book is based on this and the $2 million will be easily paid off. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3227.52s)]
*  He's a very smart and good guy. My point is put this in the who cares bucket and get back to the [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3235.04s)]
*  facts. Friedberg mentioned it. We have a debt ceiling problem that's in the offing. Saxe [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3239.52s)]
*  mentioned it. We have a commercial real estate crisis. We just talked about the fact that he [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3244.08s)]
*  didn't raise rates enough nor did he cut enough. So we're in this weird middle path that Jay Powell [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3248.88s)]
*  we're talking about. So those are the facts on the ground that I think we should focus on because [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3254.48s)]
*  those will have implications to how people can borrow, start businesses, capitalize risk assets. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3258.32s)]
*  That's a big problem. I guess the moral hazard comes up Saxe and the critique I think that [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3266.0s)]
*  people have had of you, you know, focusing on bank bailouts, etc. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3272.48s)]
*  has been you have been anti bailout. And now hey, maybe backstopping the deposits, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3278.88s)]
*  not backstopping the bank, the shareholders lost you very clear about that. But let's talk about [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3286.8s)]
*  moral hazard here for a minute. Are we started getting not for bail? When did I say I was either [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3291.2s)]
*  for or against bailouts? I just clearly stated you were not. I just clearly say you're not. I'm [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3296.64s)]
*  saying this is the critique that people have had of you. So I'm giving you a chance to address it. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3299.52s)]
*  Why are you giving him people's critiques of him? Because I want him to talk about the future moral [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3303.12s)]
*  hazard. User 76542 on Twitter. Okay, I was also thinking about the Wall Street Journal, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3309.12s)]
*  the New York Times and everything. Let me jump in and just clarify. I was really clear that [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3318.4s)]
*  SVB shareholders should be wiped out. Their bondholders should be wiped out. Their management [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3323.28s)]
*  stock options should be wiped out. In fact, if it turns out that they should have known the thing [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3328.64s)]
*  was about to go under, I think their stock sales should be clawed back. So I'm not in favor of [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3333.44s)]
*  bailing out SVB. I don't care about SVB. Yes, of course. Now let's do that for commercial real [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3337.44s)]
*  estate. No, the question is what you do with deposits and depositors. Correct. I think there [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3342.0s)]
*  is a real debate about how you treat depositors in a banking crisis. And I think there are two [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3346.3199999999997s)]
*  views on that. There is kind of an old fashioned view and then there's kind of a more modern [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3354.64s)]
*  regulatory view. The old fashioned view is that if your money is in a bank and that bank goes under [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3358.72s)]
*  and you're over the FDIC amount, you lose your money. And we need people in the system to lose [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3365.52s)]
*  their money because that creates discipline on the banks. It'll make those depositors do a better job [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3372.4s)]
*  shopping for the right bank. That's kind of what I would call the old fashioned hard line view. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3377.44s)]
*  There's a more modern regulatory view, which is that, listen, the typical depositor, even [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3382.56s)]
*  a fairly sophisticated depositor like a small business or even a high net worth individual, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3388.88s)]
*  they're not in a position to evaluate the balance sheet of these banks. How are they going to figure [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3393.76s)]
*  out if there's like toxic assets that are hidden on the balance sheet of these banks? The regulators [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3398.32s)]
*  didn't see it with Silicon Valley Bank and a lot of these banks. You don't really get that much more [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3403.12s)]
*  moral hazard by putting the depositor on the hook for that. Remember, the management of the bank [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3408.0s)]
*  already is penalized severely by losing all of their stock. I'm trying to get to before [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3413.36s)]
*  Tramath interrupted me, I'm trying to get to the bigger moral hazard picture here, which is Jason, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3418.16s)]
*  fuck you before you interrupt me. But the point, eat your nuts for a second. The point I'm trying [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3422.64s)]
*  to get to is should commercial real estate, should that be belled out? How should society look at that [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3427.04s)]
*  next card that you are saying is going to tip over? How would you handle that piece? Should they? [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3433.44s)]
*  Okay, well, let me just finish the thought on depositors. So the modern regulatory view is that [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3438.4s)]
*  when you open a bank account, you shouldn't have to think about the bank's balance sheet. You just [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3442.1600000000003s)]
*  want it to be safe. You don't want all the brain damage. And look, I think there's a lot of merit [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3446.1600000000003s)]
*  to that argument. As it turns out, I've been trying to look into this, how much would it cost the system [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3450.88s)]
*  to just fully insure depositors? It turns out that we have about 17 and a half trillion in deposit [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3455.92s)]
*  in the US, almost 18 trillion. And one of the misnomers you'll hear as well as the cost is 18 [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3462.72s)]
*  trillion to basically insure all the depositors. That's not true. Because first of all, 10 trillion [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3468.64s)]
*  people don't even know already insured under FDIC. It's only about seven and a half to eight trillion. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3474.08s)]
*  That's less than half is left. Okay. Yes, right. Exactly. It's about it's around eight trillion. So [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3478.9599999999996s)]
*  isn't it shocking the numeracy of people that make these claims? I know it's crazy. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3484.7999999999997s)]
*  This is why all podcasts is top 20 or top 10 in the world because we're actually breaking down [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3489.6s)]
*  the numbers. Right. So the leading proponent of this theory that we should just basically not bail [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3495.2s)]
*  out but backstop the deposits is Bill Ackman. And he's been making, I think, a pretty compelling case [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3500.56s)]
*  that if you don't protect deposits at small banks, all the money is going to flow to the top four [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3507.2799999999997s)]
*  banks. That's already happening. Yeah, we're watching it happen. Right. So I've been trying [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3512.3199999999997s)]
*  to figure out how much it would actually cost us to do that. And what I've realized is that it's [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3516.56s)]
*  not 18 trillion. It's eight trillion. But by the way, that's the amount of deposits. That's not the [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3520.96s)]
*  risk premium. So if you look at FDIC at the end of last year, there was about 130 billion that had [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3527.44s)]
*  been paid in to the FDIC fund by premiums paid by these banks. So in other words, the insurance [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3533.52s)]
*  premium paid by banks was about 1.3%. So if you were to now additionally cover the whole thing, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3540.16s)]
*  all the deposits, it would be another roughly 100 billion of premiums paid by these banks. That [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3547.44s)]
*  seems very manageable to me, actually. The question is, is the FDIC fund adequate? And I think we're [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3553.3599999999997s)]
*  about to find out. It may be the case that a 1.3% insurance premium grossly understated the true [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3559.44s)]
*  risk of putting your deposit in a bank. And we're about to find out that the FDIC is inadequate. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3567.84s)]
*  I don't know the answer to that question. Well, I think this boils down to the profitability [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3572.4s)]
*  that an equity shareholder of a bank expects of them. And to your point, is it viable for large [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3576.7200000000003s)]
*  GSIBs to guarantee 100% of their deposits? Absolutely. The implication of that [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3586.96s)]
*  will be an enormous hit to their short-term profitability and their return on invested capital. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3594.96s)]
*  It would just take a massive hit. And so as a result, the stocks of those banks would fall [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3599.2000000000003s)]
*  pretty precipitously, which would have a real negative impact on the executives and the CEOs [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3604.4s)]
*  of those banks and the shareholders that own those bank equities. So I think ultimately, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3609.6800000000003s)]
*  it'll come down to that decision, which is that if you do want to protect the depositor in the [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3615.12s)]
*  American banking system, 100% for every dollar, and do it in a simple way, it will come at the [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3620.16s)]
*  sake of the equity holders of the banks. And if you're willing to make that trade-off, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3626.16s)]
*  then you can guarantee 100% of the deposits. If you do not want to make that trade-off, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3630.56s)]
*  then the equity holders will still retain more value than they would otherwise. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3635.12s)]
*  And Freeberg, we've seen a couple of examples of the market, the free market, looking at the [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3639.52s)]
*  situation and making new products and services. Wealthfront, Mercury Bank both talked about [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3645.12s)]
*  load balancing across 12 accounts, $3 million. So that would make some people who had over 250k [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3651.3599999999997s)]
*  just instantly be back stopped and insured. And then where, you know, there's discussion of, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3658.64s)]
*  I talked about last week, hey, why don't you just have a vault where you pay a bank to hold your [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3666.72s)]
*  money safely? I got a ton of responses from all in fans pointing out multiple banks and services [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3670.8s)]
*  that have been trying to do this, and also crypto solutions. So is it going to be a free market [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3676.2400000000002s)]
*  solution, you think, or when we're starting to see them emerge, that maybe covers this gap a [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3681.44s)]
*  little bit, Freeberg. And then what are your thoughts just generally on should we backstop [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3685.92s)]
*  the banks and the deposit, I'm sorry, the banks, the depositors, to be clear. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3688.8s)]
*  So if we just quickly analyze the function of a bank, they loan money to either residential real [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3692.08s)]
*  estate buyers, like homeowners, or commercial real estate buyers or businesses that need it, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3702.4s)]
*  I think the majority of the capital goes to residential real estate. And if they can't loan [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3708.48s)]
*  enough money, they typically buy bonds, right, they buy other people's loans in the form of [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3712.7999999999997s)]
*  bond securities like treasuries or asset backed securities or other things like that. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3719.76s)]
*  Or mortgage backed securities. So they use the cash to make those investments to make those loans. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3726.2400000000002s)]
*  And then they obviously earn a return on that. You know, I think we've talked about this in the [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3732.0s)]
*  past, the thing that that biology, I think has misstated, and it would be good to have a [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3735.76s)]
*  conversation with him about this publicly, because I have listened to some of his interviews in the [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3741.2000000000003s)]
*  last couple days. He says the banks are, they don't have the money that you the depositor [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3746.48s)]
*  thinks that you have. And so what he's saying kind of implies that there is no money that there is [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3753.52s)]
*  no asset value there at all. He uses Sam Bankman Fried and FTX as an example, that the money that [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3760.08s)]
*  was given to Sam Bankman Fried's, you know, exchange fund was used to buy assets that then [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3767.44s)]
*  very quickly declined in value by 99%. But he held them on the book at 100%. And then he [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3771.84s)]
*  reinvested the money in all sorts of other different stuff. And in the case of the loans [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3778.2400000000002s)]
*  made by banks, and the assets that they as a result hold, the value may have dropped by 25% [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3784.6400000000003s)]
*  in kind of the worst case, which is, you know, the Silicon Valley Bank tenure, treasury bond scenario, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3792.1600000000003s)]
*  where they bought, you know, all $20 billion worth of treasury bonds. And you know, they took a big [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3797.92s)]
*  hit on that. But it doesn't mean that there's no asset value. It means that the value has declined. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3803.2000000000003s)]
*  And typically, there's a buffer between the asset value that the banks are meant to hold, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3808.8s)]
*  and the deposits that they owe back to their customers. And if that buffer gets exceeded, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3813.28s)]
*  then the bank is technically has negative equity. And if all the, you know, depositors said, I want [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3818.48s)]
*  my money back, and they went and sold those bonds into the market, they wouldn't be able to make the [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3823.92s)]
*  depositors whole. But it doesn't mean the depositors end up with zero. It means instead of getting 100 [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3827.84s)]
*  cents on the dollar, they get 93 cents on the dollar, 88 cents on the dollar, and it would [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3833.04s)]
*  require an orderly dissolution of the bank's assets selling those bonds into the market to generate [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3837.28s)]
*  the cash to pay back the depositors. So the reason we've seen this kind of this Fed vertical spike [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3842.7200000000003s)]
*  number is because assets are moving so quickly, depositors are moving their value so quickly from [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3847.92s)]
*  one bank to another, that in order for the banks to make the cash available to those depositors, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3853.1200000000003s)]
*  they've had to borrow from the Fed. And then they're going into the market and doing this kind of, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3857.36s)]
*  they should be doing this orderly asset sale of the bonds to generate the cash to pay back the Fed, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3861.1200000000003s)]
*  which is basically what it is. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3865.6800000000003s)]
*  So it's just musical chairs. Money's moving around, causing these problems. It's musical chairs. And [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3866.6400000000003s)]
*  if the musical chairs stop, then we don't have this problem, correct? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3870.2400000000002s)]
*  So if people stopped moving deposits around, then you're right, the banks wouldn't need to borrow [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3874.6400000000003s)]
*  money to give depositors their money and then go do the work of selling the bonds in the market. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3880.6400000000003s)]
*  And why are people free moving their money around? Because of the FDM? [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3884.1600000000003s)]
*  Because it's not insured. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3887.92s)]
*  So here we go. So you just insure it and this whole thing stops. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3889.1200000000003s)]
*  So it costs them nothing to just say that, right? [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3892.4s)]
*  Yeah. So actually, here's the thing, Jake, how you mentioned this case that you hear a lot of [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3894.6400000000003s)]
*  people saying, well, why don't you just take your two and a half million dollars and break it up [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3898.6400000000003s)]
*  into 10 accounts of 250. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3902.0800000000004s)]
*  Which is what people are doing. Yeah. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3903.44s)]
*  Yeah. Well, look, it's not feasible when you need to run a big payroll at the end of the month and [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3904.88s)]
*  you got payables. It's administratively too complicated. And by the way, what have you [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3908.2400000000002s)]
*  accomplished doing that? You haven't solved anything. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3912.1600000000003s)]
*  So who hasn't accomplished for the startup? It has accomplished. I'm just giving them prediction. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3915.36s)]
*  The system. Yeah. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3919.6s)]
*  Why wouldn't you just raise FDIC to two and a half million or have FDIC be based on the number of [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3920.4s)]
*  employees in your company or allow a higher class, a business class of FDIC that goes up to say, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3925.84s)]
*  yes, exactly. There's 10 million. And in exchange, the quid pro quo has to be [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3933.6s)]
*  that the bank can't put that money in risky assets. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3938.2400000000002s)]
*  This is so obvious. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3942.1600000000003s)]
*  The reason I walked through that whole explanation is because I want to answer your question. I'm [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3945.84s)]
*  sorry it took so long, but like I want to highlight that because that is what an insurance [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3948.8s)]
*  underwriter put aside the FDIC and put aside banks and put aside the government's role. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3953.04s)]
*  Yes. That's what an insurance underwriter's job would be. They would look at the volatility and [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3957.6s)]
*  the pricing on the bonds that the bank holds. And they would determine ultimately two things, [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3962.4s)]
*  probability of loss and severity of loss. And the probability is how likely is it that you end up in [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3968.2400000000002s)]
*  negative equity and that you have people requesting money and you have to sell those [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3973.28s)]
*  bonds at a loss very quickly. And then the severity is how much would you actually lose? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3976.7200000000003s)]
*  So if the Fed raises rates by 3% and your entire book is tied up in 10 year bonds, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3980.5600000000004s)]
*  you see a 25% decline in the value of your bond portfolio. That's as bad as it gets. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3987.1200000000003s)]
*  If you start with a 10% buffer, now you only have 85% of the money you owe the depositors. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3991.76s)]
*  So your loss is 15 cents on the dollar. So the insurance company would say, what's the probability [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=3996.88s)]
*  of that event happening? How much should we underwrite it for? What should we charge as a [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4001.84s)]
*  premium to do that? And that's ultimately how the rates would get set. Now, the problem with most [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4004.96s)]
*  insurance models around this sort of a problem set is that these are the extreme tail events that [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4009.04s)]
*  have never happened. And so the insurance to Sachs's point is super cheap leading up to the [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4015.1200000000003s)]
*  extreme tail event. And then everyone's like, oh my gosh, we underpaid for so many years. We didn't [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4021.6800000000003s)]
*  realize how severe the losses could have been. We didn't realize how significant this was going to [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4026.56s)]
*  be. And as a result, you now see this kind of multiplying effect because people are like, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4030.96s)]
*  oh my gosh, if it happened to them, it could happen to me, let's all sell and it gets worse [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4035.52s)]
*  and worse and worse. And so the real rate for the insurance going forward will now have to take into [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4038.2400000000002s)]
*  account this massive risk. But the game theory problem is, as Sachs has pointed out, if you just [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4044.4s)]
*  insure everyone, the cost of the insurance actually goes way, way, way, way down because now you don't [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4048.8s)]
*  have this money movement problem. And so the point is the more you insure at this point, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4053.68s)]
*  the cheaper the insurance will actually be if you're an actuarial or free market underwriter, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4059.2s)]
*  free market kind of underwriting process on this thing. Because now the probability of having this [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4065.12s)]
*  bank run goes way, way down and therefore the cost of the insurance should go way down. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4070.72s)]
*  And so the irony is if you actually did, and this is getting super technical, but if you actually [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4076.24s)]
*  looked at the statistical model and said, how much is this going to cost to insure every deposit, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4082.16s)]
*  it gets much, much cheaper, the higher the deposits that you're willing to insure would be. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4087.44s)]
*  That's my sense of what the free market would do here. And it's certainly what I think the [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4094.08s)]
*  federal government should probably think about doing if they're going to continue to play a role [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4097.4400000000005s)]
*  in backstopping banks. The net net is people, startups right now are doing five to 10 banks, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4100.88s)]
*  I'm watching it happen. They're doing all these sweep accounts, they're doing multiple accounts. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4108.56s)]
*  So the government, if it doesn't raise the FDIC limit, is basically just creating extra work for [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4112.4800000000005s)]
*  everybody. And it's going to be the same outcome. So this people are going to the street will find [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4117.2s)]
*  its own use for technology and how to hack this. And that's what's happening with these services. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4120.96s)]
*  Just to steal man, the the old fashioned view or the traditional view of this, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4126.72s)]
*  they would say that, well, you want those startups being paranoid, you want those startups doing the [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4131.28s)]
*  work of disciplining these banks by moving their money elsewhere if they detect a problem. However, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4136.0s)]
*  the problem with that is you get these bank runs. That is what a bank run is, in parts, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4142.72s)]
*  is people moving their money because they're fearing that the bank is not doing a good job [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4147.52s)]
*  with their loan portfolio. So this is why in the let's call it the olden days before FDIC, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4151.6s)]
*  we had bank runs and panics all the time. And that's why FDIC was invented. So there's a [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4157.84s)]
*  hugely destructive problem that comes along with placing the depositor in charge of disciplining [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4164.320000000001s)]
*  the banks. And I would argue that the depositors not the best person to do it. It's the regulator [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4172.32s)]
*  just to kind of layer on what what Friedberg was saying. I think there's like a fundamental [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4176.639999999999s)]
*  market failure with banking in the sense that the depositor or the consumer and the bank think [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4180.88s)]
*  they're getting two completely different things. When you open a bank account or a checking account, [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4186.719999999999s)]
*  you think you're getting a checkbook, an ATM card, a place to do payroll run, you know, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4191.5199999999995s)]
*  and service as a service. And maybe you make a little bit of interest, but it's not even [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4197.759999999999s)]
*  your main motivation. Okay, that's what you think you're getting your money most of all is safe, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4201.76s)]
*  because you're not signing up with a service provider to have any chance of losing your money. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4206.320000000001s)]
*  You're not gambling. Right. But now what does the bank think it's getting? You know what the [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4210.320000000001s)]
*  bank thinks is getting an unsecured loan that they can then turn around and invest in whatever they [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4213.6s)]
*  want or whatever the law allows them to. So there's a disconnect between the parties and [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4218.72s)]
*  the transaction. Exactly. It's a total disconnect. And moreover, the way the management of the bank [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4221.92s)]
*  is compensated is that they only have to pay back your loan, your deposit basically is their loan [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4226.4s)]
*  at par. And anything they make on a bet that they make with that money, they get to keep, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4233.5199999999995s)]
*  they get to keep all the upside. Their stockholders and management get to keep that. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4238.32s)]
*  And those incentives are what are driving this. And that's what drove the risk in all likelihood [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4241.44s)]
*  at Silicon Valley Bank. They were getting $200 billion, whatever percentage point they got, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4245.599999999999s)]
*  Chamath, somehow the executive team was compensated for it. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4250.799999999999s)]
*  Their incentive, it's not just them, but the whole banking system creates the incentive. They're [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4255.12s)]
*  highly leveraged. The deposits from their standpoint are leveraged. They're leveraged 10 to 1. So their [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4258.88s)]
*  incentive is to go to the casino and gamble it because they get to keep all the upside. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4265.2s)]
*  And if they lose it, it's basically someone else on the hook. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4269.2s)]
*  Final word, Chamath. In early May, the Fed will [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4272.64s)]
*  release their investigation into signature bank and SVB. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4277.44s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4282.160000000001s)]
*  Powell said that this week. I think it'll be really interesting to see how much honesty they [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4282.72s)]
*  both put into the report and then whether the entirety of that report is made available to the [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4288.96s)]
*  rest of us to read. But I think Sachs has very elegantly summarized what's happening. And [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4294.400000000001s)]
*  it doesn't take a genius to figure out that this doesn't make sense. So the question is, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4302.64s)]
*  what is the tolerance that we have for changing something that clearly is [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4309.36s)]
*  mischaracterized? What consumers think they're getting and what banks are then doing are two [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4316.32s)]
*  totally different things. And if the Fed actually is really, really honest and really lays bare [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4321.679999999999s)]
*  everything that happened, it'll be very hard to not legislate changes based on it. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4329.759999999999s)]
*  And your best swing at a legislative change would be what, Chamath? What is the low hanging [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4334.88s)]
*  fruit? What's the layup here? Well, I think we've seen this happening in other markets for a while, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4341.28s)]
*  which is that banks have become, in fairness to them, much, much better at risk management post [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4346.56s)]
*  Dodd-Frank, post great financial crisis. And the result of that is that there's been a lot of [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4352.72s)]
*  emerging private credit markets because most of the bank is about lending, right? They're not [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4357.6s)]
*  really buying equities, they're lending money, they're a debtor in possession of something, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4362.64s)]
*  right? And there's been just a massive explosion of private credit. And it started in the most [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4366.64s)]
*  obvious areas. It started in things like CLOs, it started in asset-backed securities, solar, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4375.6s)]
*  car loans, credit cards, mortgages, private equity-backed deals. So I think the rational [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4382.08s)]
*  answer is that banks need to protect 100% of deposits and that if they want to have [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4390.24s)]
*  extracurricular activities, if you will, they need to be able to raise money from investors, [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4399.5199999999995s)]
*  put that to work in a really fair and transparent way, and then share in the profits between all of [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4407.44s)]
*  the related parties that are involved in that transaction, no different than any other risk [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4414.639999999999s)]
*  taking organization. And I think that this is now what we've probably shined a light on, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4418.96s)]
*  is in really odd loophole that just needs to get closed in 2023. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4425.44s)]
*  Aaron Powell There's such easy [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4430.4800000000005s)]
*  hygienic changes here. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4433.44s)]
*  Michael O'Brien Let's put it a different way. If you [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4434.4s)]
*  raised money for a liquid hedge fund that had quarterly redemptions and then violated the LPA [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4438.0s)]
*  and stuffed it into private companies that had 10-year illiquidity, there would be hell to pay. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4444.4s)]
*  Aaron Powell Yeah. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4449.839999999999s)]
*  Michael O'Brien And vice versa. If you raised money on 10-year illiquid locked-up capital on [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4450.32s)]
*  the presumption you were going to invest in startups and then instead put it in the stock [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4455.12s)]
*  market thinking that you could flip it and make some money, you would have violated the LPA and [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4459.04s)]
*  there would be hell to pay. Similarly, I think what Sachs is stating is that there is a mismatch [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4464.48s)]
*  of what the depositor, in this case the investor, expects and what the risk manager is doing. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4469.92s)]
*  And I think that you have to correct that one way or the other. Make it abundantly clear that we're [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4477.28s)]
*  never going to insure 100% and deal with that risk or make it 100% and deal with the fallout, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4481.36s)]
*  which is largely about wiping out a lot of equity value in banks. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4488.48s)]
*  Aaron Powell LPA equals limited partnership agreement. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4492.8s)]
*  Michael O'Brien Right. Just to clarify one thing, I'm not saying that these bank managers are all [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4496.16s)]
*  going to the casino and gambling the money. I think that they are generally more responsible [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4499.92s)]
*  than that. What I'm saying is that the incentives created by this crazy system we call banking [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4503.6s)]
*  create a weird incentive for them to gamble because they're so highly levered. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4510.5599999999995s)]
*  From their standpoint, your deposits are their leverage. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4514.64s)]
*  Aaron Powell Everybody but the GSIBs because I think the GSIBs, there's so much scrutiny. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4518.32s)]
*  If you look at how well run Citi, B of A, Wells, and JPM are relative and contrast them to [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4522.72s)]
*  the sub GSIBs, it's like night and day. And so the other thing that I think we've realized is, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4529.4400000000005s)]
*  who thought it was a good idea to raise the bar on eligibility from 50 billion of assets to 200? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4535.4400000000005s)]
*  Clearly now that made no sense. It makes more sense to actually categorize every bank [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4542.16s)]
*  Michael O'Brien As systemically important, maybe not globally, but at a minimum to the US economy, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4547.92s)]
*  because these people play a vital function in society. And they were allowed to take a [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4553.52s)]
*  much more aggressive risk posture because they were able to lobby the government to change the rules. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4560.56s)]
*  Aaron Powell The CEO of TikTok, which claims to be an American company now, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4564.4s)]
*  or an international company, was in front of Congress today. His name is Sho Chu. This is [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4568.72s)]
*  the first time he's really, I think, spoken publicly in an extended period, four and a half [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4574.64s)]
*  hours he was grilled. And it was absolutely brutal. It's the first time I've seen a congressional [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4580.88s)]
*  hearing that was bipartisan in a long time. And he said that, quote, the bottom line is, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4587.360000000001s)]
*  this is an American date. This is American data on American soil by an American company overseen by [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4595.6s)]
*  American personnel. And then was immediately [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4600.08s)]
*  squirrely when asked if Chinese employees, including engineers have access to this US data. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4605.84s)]
*  And he said this is a complex subject over and over again, he was evasive. And this did not [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4612.96s)]
*  look good for TikTok. Well, I should now becomes does it become divested and go public? Or does it [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4620.08s)]
*  get shut down? Sax? I think his goose was cooked as soon as they asked him the question. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4627.28s)]
*  In preparation for this hearing, did you consult with any member of the CCP? [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4632.719999999999s)]
*  And he could not just outright say no. Nope. So that's his goose was cooked as soon as he couldn't [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4636.719999999999s)]
*  just say no. What do you think about the bipartisan nature of this? And what do you think the outcome [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4641.759999999999s)]
*  is? Sax? Well, this is one of the rare things where it is bipartisan. I mean, there's there's [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4645.12s)]
*  so much outrage and anger at this. I think that they should let the company divest it. I think it [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4649.36s)]
*  is divested or shut down for TikTok. Since we're not communists here, I think they should be given [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4656.72s)]
*  the chance to fully divest to an American owned company. But look, I just wish that there was [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4662.08s)]
*  as much bipartisan consensus and outrage directed not just at Chinese spying of Americans, but on [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4669.12s)]
*  the American deep state spying on Americans, because we just had hearings showing that the [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4677.52s)]
*  American government conducts elaborate spying operations surveillance of Americans on social [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4683.2s)]
*  media. This was all revealed in the Twitter files. And we got certainly no bipartisan consensus on [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4688.8s)]
*  that. Republicans were outraged, but Democrats tried to portray it as some sort of spat between [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4694.88s)]
*  Trump and Chrissy Teigen. I mean, that's all they wanted to talk about. So I would like to see [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4699.599999999999s)]
*  this problem comprehensively addressed. And that means I think TikTok going into the hands of an [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4704.48s)]
*  American company, but I also would like more assurances that American companies will not be [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4711.04s)]
*  working with the deep state to spy on us and infringement. Chrissy Teigen and Donald Trump, [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4716.32s)]
*  who are two people you'd never invite to a dinner party? Free Berg, what are your thoughts? Is it [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4720.48s)]
*  going to divest? Should it be forced to divest? Being intellectually honest about it? What are [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4725.76s)]
*  your thoughts on TikTok in America? Yeah, I think I've showed this in the past. I think they're [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4731.36s)]
*  probably going to have to spin this thing out. And if they hold any equity, if the Chinese parent [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4738.32s)]
*  company holds any equity interests, it'll probably be non-voting shares. And there'll be a mandate [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4742.799999999999s)]
*  that the majority of the shares and some degree of oversight. Do you believe that's the right thing [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4747.84s)]
*  to do from a national security issue for America to force them to do that? I don't know from a [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4751.92s)]
*  national security point of view. I really don't. I don't have an opinion from national security [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4758.16s)]
*  in TikTok. I don't know. I've always thought that TikTok was a really, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4762.88s)]
*  what's the right word? It's like a firefly for Chinese invasion. And it feels like [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4770.32s)]
*  it's a very easy kind of target for, I think what is generally a big kind of social consciousness [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4777.76s)]
*  right now. So whether or not there's actually some national security points, if there were, [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4784.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that national security person would have stood up and said, we need to stop [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4792.24s)]
*  this thing. I'm not sure I've heard that publicly. But I will say like my point of view from like, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4796.48s)]
*  just seeing the political behavior is that they're probably going to mandate that these guys spin [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4803.12s)]
*  this thing out to US investors and that they don't own any, that the Chinese don't have any [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4807.12s)]
*  equity or management oversight or interest in it. In China itself, the Chinese government does not [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4812.88s)]
*  allow kids to play video games during the week and only three hours on the weekend. They're using [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4820.96s)]
*  apps like WeChat to dictate social score and social behavior, whether it's smoking on a train [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4825.12s)]
*  or not paying your bills. And they are saying they will not divest. But anybody who is an investor [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4831.84s)]
*  in a company that had a chance to go public for tens of billions of dollars and eventually [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4840.96s)]
*  take on and people believe that this is a viable competitor to Facebook and Instagram, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4845.76s)]
*  this could be a company worth ultimately hundreds of billions of dollars. If you were an investor [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4851.04s)]
*  in China, you would want to IPO, you would want to get liquidity. So if they are refusing to sell, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4855.12s)]
*  what does that tell you as a market participant and participant in somebody who's been a capital [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4861.76s)]
*  allocator for over a decade? There's bigger problems in China than even TikTok US represents [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4866.8s)]
*  for them. I think that's probably what it means. So it's a pretty bad tell. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4871.76s)]
*  I don't think divestiture is a real option. Because when you think about the details of that, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4876.96s)]
*  how will the government be satisfied that the code base was separated elegantly, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4882.08s)]
*  that there was no malware surreptitiously planted? How will you actually prove all of this [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4886.64s)]
*  to a degree that satisfies a legislator? So I think the pound of flesh that they want [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4894.96s)]
*  is more easily and more salaciously satisfied by shutting the thing down. So if I had to bet on [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4902.24s)]
*  what happens, I bet more on that. I didn't think TikTok did a very good job. And I think that there [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4907.52s)]
*  are some, they were terrible today. And I think that there are some real issues around how much [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4913.84s)]
*  control does actually flow back. I don't think that it was definitive, he needed to be much [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4919.52s)]
*  clearer and adamant that this was an independent business that didn't have back doors to China and [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4926.8s)]
*  the CCP to appease Congress. He didn't do that. No, he was like, I have to check in on that. I'm [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4933.84s)]
*  not sure. Yeah. I think it was a little bit of the exact opposite, actually. Sax is right. That first [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4938.96s)]
*  question was just the death blow right from the beginning. It's like, uh-oh, this is not going to [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4943.76s)]
*  go in a good place because they should have been able to see that that question was going to get [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4947.92s)]
*  asked. And you need to have that asked and answered philosophy where the only answer is no. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4951.76s)]
*  The only answer you could have given is no. And the fact that he wasn't able to say that, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4958.72s)]
*  it was a bit of a fait accompli as soon as that was in my mind. I was like, this thing is getting [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4963.2s)]
*  shut down because I don't think there's a shut down. Yeah. There's no divestiture plan that can [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4967.12s)]
*  be technically audited in a short amount of time to appease these folks. They want a pound of flesh [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4972.56s)]
*  and then separately, the bigger issue that I think you have to deal with is what does that mean [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4979.92s)]
*  for how other governments may be pressured to act who want to be on the pro-US camp? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4987.36s)]
*  And I think that that's a question because [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4994.0s)]
*  bike dance and TikTok have presence beyond just China and the US. A third question is, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=4998.88s)]
*  how does the golden vote get used on the bike dance board? And what do they do? And do they [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5004.88s)]
*  even want this thing public? Explain golden vote. Essentially, they'll decide what happens to that [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5010.4s)]
*  company. And they have that in Alibaba. They have that, I think, at Tencent. I think they have that [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5014.639999999999s)]
*  at bike dance. So the Chinese government has a very strong hand in the direction of these [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5018.96s)]
*  businesses. And then the final point is that there's a secondary app that TikTok has called [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5024.8s)]
*  CapCut, which also is enormously popular in the United States, which is yet another [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5031.04s)]
*  potential backdoor for privacy or spying violations, whatever the US Congress wants to pin on them. So [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5036.64s)]
*  I think it's a very complicated moment for that business and their US asset. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5044.72s)]
*  Sacks, it's pretty clear the CCP is making this decision. If they decide, let it burn, let it get [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5051.12s)]
*  kicked out of the United States. What does that do in terms of game theory between the two countries [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5058.24s)]
*  and going forward? Because obviously they don't reciprocate. We're not allowed to have Google, [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5064.5599999999995s)]
*  Twitter, Instagram, whatever in China. So is this just putting reciprocity? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5068.08s)]
*  What decision are you saying the CCP is making? [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5074.08s)]
*  Well, the CCP has the golden vote. It's their decision to divest or not divest. Chamath believes [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5077.28s)]
*  they will not divest. I believe they will not divest. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5082.719999999999s)]
*  Chamath is saying they're not going to have the choice. I don't see what decision the CCP has in [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5084.639999999999s)]
*  this. If they don't divest. That's right. It's not a divest or don't divest. I think it'll be [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5090.08s)]
*  shut down. I think they're getting kicked out of the United States. Okay. But you believe they're [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5095.44s)]
*  going to divest Sacks? I'm saying that that's what I would support. Just to give them the chance. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5100.08s)]
*  So what do you think is going to happen? Chamath might be right. I'm not sure. But I [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5105.759999999999s)]
*  think they should be given the chance. And if you truly can't move the servers [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5109.84s)]
*  to the United States and vet the code base, I feel like you could. I think you could have an [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5114.16s)]
*  acquire or figure it out. You know, vet the code base, move the data centers, make sure there's no [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5119.68s)]
*  back doors. I think it's not impossible. Hard, but not impossible. Okay. So let's go with a scenario [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5124.64s)]
*  that it gets kicked out of the United States is shut down. Are there any second or third order [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5131.360000000001s)]
*  impacts? Yeah. It's as ratchets up the tension between the US and China, but we're already [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5135.28s)]
*  we're already there. Yeah, we're already there. No change. All right. Listen, this has been an [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5140.56s)]
*  amazing episode. Oh, Chamath, did your 3d rocket company make it to space? I saw they had a nice [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5144.96s)]
*  little lift off there. Thank you, Jason. I just wanted to give a shout out. This is like, [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5153.04s)]
*  while all this chaos is happening in the world, it's amazing to see pretty incredible engineering. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5158.64s)]
*  So last night, we did have a successful launch. So relativity has a 85% 3d printed rocket, which [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5163.6s)]
*  over time we want to try to get to 95%. But it's the fuselage, it's the engines. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5171.92s)]
*  It brings the cost of space flight down by an order of magnitude. It is a hugely disruptive idea. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5178.96s)]
*  And so what they tried to prove was that they could get this thing into space. And they [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5186.64s)]
*  accomplished a lot of goals they got past Max Q, which is sort of the point at which the atmospheric [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5191.68s)]
*  pressure is the strongest on the fuselage. So we proved structural integrity, we got to main engine [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5196.320000000001s)]
*  cutoff, we had stage two separation. So a lot of really important technical milestones were achieved, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5201.76s)]
*  it allows them now to unlock a bunch of contracts that allow us frankly, just to keep going and [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5208.56s)]
*  building, there's still a lot of work to do from here, we're building now the next generation [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5215.92s)]
*  rocket, which is called Terran R and rocket engines, which can take instead of 1500 kilograms, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5219.84s)]
*  about 20,000 kilos. So enormously proud to have been around this journey, my partner Jay's been [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5227.04s)]
*  really the key person on it. But I just wanted to give a huge shout out to Tim Ellis and the team [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5235.12s)]
*  at relativity. It's super, super, super cool. What they pulled off. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5239.6s)]
*  It's just amazing how access to space is being democratized and the prices are being lowered so [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5242.4800000000005s)]
*  dramatically. What's the impact that's going to have ultimately Freiburg you think on humanity? [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5248.88s)]
*  I mean, obviously going to Mars is this incredible feat, technologically and just mind blowing. But [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5253.36s)]
*  what do you think the the net result of all this space activity is going to be for the human [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5261.12s)]
*  condition and the species? I mean, I think there's a vibrant community of startups and money coming [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5266.8s)]
*  into this space right now. I do think all these guys are going to have to in order to gain wider [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5272.88s)]
*  spread capital markets attention. Like Elon has had to do with SpaceX are going to have to find [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5277.84s)]
*  business models that have kind of near term viability that don't depend on government [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5283.28s)]
*  contracts. Like something like Starlink. Yeah. And so I think that's the key question. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5288.72s)]
*  And obviously, these are very capital intensive businesses, they have very long horizons [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5294.400000000001s)]
*  to hit their milestones. So there's certainly capital available in the early stages [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5299.2s)]
*  to make bets on whether or not they can get these milestones. But but you know, the broader kind of [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5305.44s)]
*  attention and capital markets is going to come from these things building real kind of businesses [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5309.12s)]
*  that generate value for consumers and markets. You know, one of the things that I think can unlock [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5314.08s)]
*  opportunity for this market overall is low cost energy. You know, if we can get below, call it [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5321.28s)]
*  $0.01 to $0.03 kilowatt hour of power, call it $0.01 kilowatt hour power, I forgot the exact relationship, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5328.96s)]
*  you can get very cheap, you know, hydrogen and oxygen fuel sources. And so you know, it's funny, [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5338.160000000001s)]
*  if you actually play out the scale factor for space, for the space industry, much of it at scale, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5344.64s)]
*  will get driven by the cost of electricity. So it's another reason why there's going to be, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5352.400000000001s)]
*  I think, a pretty tight coupling between the cost of power and ultimately, the vibrancy of this market. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5356.16s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell You mentioned something important, [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5361.84s)]
*  the other key thing that we proved was that this is a pure methyl ox engine, so CH4 and liquid oxygen. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5363.44s)]
*  And it was not just stage one, but also stage two, which is unique. The only other folks that have [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5369.92s)]
*  tried to prove that you could have multi stage methyl ox is China and their most recent launch failed, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5375.2s)]
*  but it highly simplifies the engineering problem at hand, especially the ground operations and [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5380.24s)]
*  whatnot, and sort of like filling these rockets and making them viable. So that was another really [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5387.12s)]
*  big milestone. So the producing of that fuel Friedberg requires energy. If that energy was cheap, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5392.08s)]
*  it would be cheaper to make and process that fuel. That's right. Yeah, there's a pretty, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5398.639999999999s)]
*  pretty direct tie in particularly with scale manufacturing on fuel that would be used in [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5403.84s)]
*  these rocket systems and power prices here on earth. So if and as we get power prices down, [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5408.88s)]
*  either through scaled renewables, or ideally fusion or some other kind of new technology, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5414.16s)]
*  yeah, or nuclear fission or something, then the cost of, you know, fuel and the cost of these [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5419.52s)]
*  space programs goes down. And that ultimately, I think the real question everyone asks is, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5425.76s)]
*  how do you get away from it just being government services businesses, which, you know, have a low [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5430.400000000001s)]
*  multiple in markets, and obviously, you know, high dependency on one or two key customers? [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5434.56s)]
*  And how do you actually get private markets, private market products moving? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5439.68s)]
*  So tourism obviously makes a lot of sense. Travel, you know, around the earth in 20 minutes or [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5444.080000000001s)]
*  something, or, you know, some people have talked about mining or colonies, and you know, who would [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5450.96s)]
*  fund that real estate, it's unclear right now what the ultimate traveling is a wild one. Yeah, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5455.84s)]
*  I've talked to you on about that. But the idea that you could have a rocket ship take off [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5460.64s)]
*  from Texas, and then be in Tokyo, you know, like half an hour of minutes later is like, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5464.88s)]
*  I can only speak for myself, but I would really like to visit Uranus Reaper. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5471.6s)]
*  All right, everybody. Look at the player here. He's got layers are for players. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5477.200000000001s)]
*  Sexy. Look at this. He is he is two layers in. Can you get an ascot? It's subtle, isn't it? [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5482.400000000001s)]
*  He's pulling a Steve Bannon. You got to get more disheveled. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5486.56s)]
*  He needs the six pens in the collar pens, no shave. Can you tell us honestly, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5489.84s)]
*  do you have a stylist, an actual person you pay to address you? Nick, can you please put the picture [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5495.28s)]
*  of Steve Bannon where he wears the multiple shirts? Again, you need to stop for next week. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5500.72s)]
*  attacking me. It's really weird. Oh, yeah, Bannon. He thinks you're a venture venture capitalist or [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5508.08s)]
*  something. He's been attacking you. Bannon was one of many people attacking me on Twitter. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5512.8s)]
*  I think on his podcast, I think, yeah, you seem to have made a lot of a lot of new friends on [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5518.56s)]
*  Twitter lately. When you pass around half a million followers. Basically, what happens is [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5523.04s)]
*  you become a politician, you will net there will always be a fringe element of people [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5527.76s)]
*  who need to manage their anxiety by venting. And that's what you're feeling you'll live that now [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5532.72s)]
*  at million use, you know, followers, 2 million, 10 million, whatever, there's always going to be a [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5538.160000000001s)]
*  small percentage. J Cal doesn't know this, because he has mostly bots that are his followers. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5542.96s)]
*  It's true. I have an old account. Real when you have real people, this is what it is, you'll get [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5547.2s)]
*  this 1% or less than 1% and just the number goes up. So I would ignore it. Don't care. Don't worry [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub9QcwSgbjc&t=5551.2s)]
