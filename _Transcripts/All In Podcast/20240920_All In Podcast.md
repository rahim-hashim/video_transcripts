# Big Fed rate cuts, AI killing call centers, $50B govt boondoggle, VC's rough years, TrumpKamala
**All In Podcast:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM)
*  All right, everybody. Welcome back to the all in podcast. The [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=0.0s)]
*  channel has been active. We're in the afterglow. We're in the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=5.16s)]
*  all in summit afterglow. It's so glowing that Friedberg couldn't [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  make it he has been riding a high. Nick told me that in the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=13.36s)]
*  last week, just we we've only put out a half the clips and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=17.16s)]
*  they've already gotten 20 million views. Oh, my Lord. I [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  you know, I will be will be around 50 million. I think when [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=24.84s)]
*  all the clips are released, then you let it bake for a couple of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=28.4s)]
*  months. That is an astoundingly large amount of reach. Yeah. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  And that's just YouTube. We're not doing it on the podcast [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=36.12s)]
*  feed right now. YouTube and X. Well, hopefully we get on the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=38.4s)]
*  podcast feed, we get another 50 million. But free bugs in his [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=40.8s)]
*  afterglow couldn't make it but he's very busy right now. Look [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=45.32s)]
*  how happy is the summit went well. Is that marijuana? Think [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=49.0s)]
*  he's making potatoes. I think that's his farm. But I mean, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=53.96s)]
*  the smile is incredible. It's marijuana. It's a free birds [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=57.32s)]
*  version of founder. He's in fact, he's in the bog. His [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  founder mode gives you a bunch. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  She's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=68.56s)]
*  he is. He's in the afterglow. And he won't be with us this week. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=86.44s)]
*  But he organized such a great conference. Don't you think [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=91.84s)]
*  he did great? I mean, he really took charge of that. And just an [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=96.48s)]

*  is like at least a trillion times better than the first and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=105.24s)]
*  at least 50% better than the second. I mean, that's how it [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=108.04s)]
*  should go. You know, when you create something in the world, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=111.48s)]
*  Chamath, what you want to do is you want to you want to hand it [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=113.88s)]
*  off to professional management to then scale it, right? Not [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=116.84s)]
*  everybody can do the creative act of actually forming [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  something you need to have these operators to go and then [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=123.36s)]

*  feedback. Do you think that you did better as moderator because [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=230.88s)]
*  you finally let go of just the conference organization? What do [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=234.32s)]
*  you think? Yeah, I think that you're able to focus on your [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=239.84s)]
*  unique value added instead of immersing yourself in a bunch of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=243.88s)]
*  my details that could be handled by the team. I agree. It was [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=247.32s)]
*  absolutely fantastic process to get you to let go. Well, you [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  know, you have it's a fair point. I did people did say my [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  moderation was dialed in and I appreciate that positive [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=259.88s)]
*  feedback from everybody. And yeah, there is something to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=262.12s)]
*  having people you can trust with the content. You know, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=266.28000000000003s)]
*  moderation was excellent this time. It was better than before [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  because I think that you're actually exceptional as a [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=271.6s)]
*  moderator. And I think you're mostly average as a conference [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=274.88s)]
*  producer. I do think as a moderator, you're excellent. I [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=278.16s)]
*  mean, like some of the most memorable moments were you [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=284.52s)]
*  basically drawing out contrasting opinions. And the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=289.44s)]
*  way that the people engaged with them was so healthy and good. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=294.32s)]
*  That was the I think the recurring theme. So I gave you [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=298.0s)]
*  an enormous amount of credit. I think you did an exceptional job. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=301.28s)]
*  But I also think it's because you were able to focus on what [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  you're doing. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=305.92s)]
*  I do agree with that. I was talking to Jade about and she [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=306.92s)]
*  said, and Nick also pointed out you were really dialed in Jake [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=309.82s)]
*  Owl, what's up? And I said, I'm not worrying about the party and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=312.52s)]
*  the vendors and the front desk and the sponsors and it is [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=315.6s)]
*  actually you're able to focus. Did you have some favorite [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=318.92s)]
*  moments yourself there? Saks any favorite moments for your panels [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=322.04s)]
*  or things maybe that exceeded expectations for you? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, I thought the Mearsheimer Jeffrey Sachs panel was great. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=328.0s)]
*  I thought it would be which is why I helped organize it. But I [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=332.48s)]
*  was just glad that the audience so many people in the audience [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=336.16s)]
*  reacted and said that was the surprise hit of the conference. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=338.48s)]
*  I would say that was my favorite of the event. One of the best [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  panels I've ever been part of. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=343.04s)]
*  It's the most viewed. It's like slightly above Elon's one. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=344.8s)]
*  Really? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=347.48s)]
*  Oh, just behind you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  Elon's slightly ahead. But yeah, it's still like growing. It's [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=349.48s)]
*  like finding an audience. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=352.36s)]
*  Well, I think that I think that if you if you look at the one [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=354.12s)]
*  from last year, Graham Allison, where he got a standing ovation, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=357.14s)]
*  the thing is, there are these village elders where they are at [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=359.72s)]
*  a point in their life where they're willing to just be a [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=364.6s)]
*  truth teller. But oftentimes, they're deplatformed. And we [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  have the ability to actually bring some of the smartest of [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=372.48s)]
*  them on and give them a voice. And it's incredible how much [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=375.72s)]
*  they resonate because what they say is so logical and sensible. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  So that's a really important thing that we have now at our [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=384.64000000000004s)]
*  disposal. And I think that people really appreciate it, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=387.90000000000003s)]
*  you know, so we're like, I think we're doing a really important [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=391.04s)]
*  job in doing that. And now the question is, what village elders [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=394.40000000000003s)]
*  do we get next year to keep, you know, being truth tellers? Well, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=398.22s)]
*  give us your thoughts. You know, there's an all in Twitter handle, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=401.64s)]
*  and he's Chamath, David Sachs, and I'm at Jason in Freberg's. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=405.12s)]
*  That Freberg, just tell us who you think would be great. But [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=408.62s)]
*  Sachs, I know you're super excited and want to give Biden [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=410.84s)]
*  his flowers. The Fed just cut rates 50 bips and the stock [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=413.32s)]
*  market is tearing it up right now. On Wednesday, Fed cut [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=417.47999999999996s)]
*  interest rates by a half a percentage point, taking them [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=422.64s)]
*  down off of a 23 year high. We've been talking about this [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=426.4s)]
*  for two years here on this podcast, first rate cut since [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=430.48s)]
*  March of 2020, which is about when we started this podcast, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=433.28s)]
*  Jay Powell basically said the Fed thinks inflation is coming [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=437.96s)]
*  down to around 2% nicely. And they don't want the job market to [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=441.0s)]
*  soften any further than it already has. He also mentioned, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=446.36s)]
*  immigration has helped soften the market, the labor market as [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=450.32s)]
*  well, obviously, with all those new people looking for jobs. So [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=454.8s)]
*  in the last two months, July and August, CPI has been at a two [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=457.64s)]
*  handle, we talked about that 2.9% in July 2.5% in August, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  here's the CPI over the last decade. Obviously, massive boom [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=465.15999999999997s)]
*  in interest that you see there from 2021 to 2023. Many obviously [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=470.52s)]
*  think we're gonna have more rate cuts, probably 25 every meeting [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=477.68s)]
*  for a little bit. And Dow's already at an all time high [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=480.96s)]
*  surged 300 points on the news. Here's a here's some interesting [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=487.28s)]
*  data about the 50 basis point kickoff cuts. So this is where [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=493.4s)]
*  it gets interesting. Chamath fed only started publicizing their [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=497.56s)]
*  interest rate changes in 1994. Since 94. Fed has initiated [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=501.16s)]
*  cutting cycles six times. Here's the chart. Take a good look at [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=504.72s)]
*  that 9598 2019. They started with 25 bits, oh one and oh seven [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=508.52s)]
*  after the great financial crisis, they started with a 50 [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=515.72s)]
*  bit cut. So obviously, there was an emergency 50 bit cut in March [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=519.04s)]
*  of 2021 COVID hit. Oh, one oh seven 2020 very severe [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=524.16s)]
*  situations. And the what happened in the markets is what [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=529.08s)]
*  I want to discuss with both of you today in 2000. One market [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=533.52s)]
*  fell 31% in the two years after that rate cut in 2007 market [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=537.64s)]
*  fell 26% after two years. So and 2020 despite all the fears [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=542.96s)]
*  market ripped 44% over two years. What's the more likely [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=548.08s)]
*  scenario Chamath? Is this similar to the dot com great [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=552.1600000000001s)]
*  financial crisis or similar to 2020? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=556.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think 2020 you have to put it a big asterix because the [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=559.76s)]
*  question is what would have happened had there not been [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=563.2800000000001s)]
*  COVID and had there not been an entire global shutdown. So if [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=566.64s)]
*  you go back to that chart, you could probably just extrapolate [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=570.52s)]
*  and cut out that part that's flat. Because the part that's [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=574.96s)]
*  flat from 2020 to 2022 was largely artificially created. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=579.64s)]
*  Because on top of that, we injected so much money into the [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=584.84s)]
*  economy. The reality is we probably would have raised at [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=587.16s)]
*  some rate of change that you could have predicted from 2016. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  So what do you what do you take away from that? I think that you [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=594.96s)]
*  have to like, realize we're at a point in the economy, where you [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=597.96s)]
*  cut rates, because there's tension. And there's tension [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=604.2s)]
*  between employment and unemployment, there's tension [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=608.96s)]
*  between earnings, growth and contraction. And so it's a [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=612.76s)]
*  stimulatory move. So if you look through that stimulatory move, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=617.9200000000001s)]
*  why is the Fed doing this? And why will they cut probably all [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=622.4000000000001s)]
*  the way down to two or 3% by the end of 26? It's because we [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=626.88s)]
*  now need to stimulate the economy. So the reason why [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=630.72s)]
*  markets tend to fall once the rate cycle starts is because the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=635.52s)]
*  next couple of quarters sort of demonstrate what I think the Fed [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=640.96s)]
*  is expecting, which is that there's pressure in the economy. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=645.16s)]
*  We have not seen that flow through in earnings or in how [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=649.68s)]
*  companies describe markets on the field by and large, except [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=654.32s)]
*  for a few. So I think this part of the cycle now will be about [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=658.36s)]
*  all of these companies telling us whether there's nothing to see [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=662.12s)]
*  here, or whether there is actual real pressure. And if there is [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=665.32s)]
*  real pressure, it'll probably look like the several times [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=668.36s)]
*  before where you're just going to have to contract the value of [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=671.32s)]
*  financial assets, because they're just not worth as much [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=675.32s)]
*  when they're earning less. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=677.7600000000001s)]
*  Okay, Sax, any thoughts here? Just balls and shrugs? [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=679.2s)]
*  I think a lot of people are commenting on the fact that the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=683.56s)]
*  only other two times where we've had a 50 basis point rate cut in [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=687.24s)]
*  modern history, it has been just before a recession. So I think [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=691.4s)]
*  this happened in 2001, 2007, right before the recession. And [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=695.76s)]
*  the Fed had to do a dramatic rate cut because they could see [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=701.76s)]
*  in the data that things were weakening. So a lot of you are [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=704.1999999999999s)]
*  asking the question, well, is that what's going on here? Now, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=706.36s)]
*  Powell's comments, though, are indicating that the economy is [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=709.52s)]
*  in good shape. He said the economy is in very good shape, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=714.16s)]
*  that basically indicating that they had tamed inflation, and [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=716.24s)]
*  that they would look to cut another 50 basis points this [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=720.44s)]
*  year. So Powell's rhetoric is, in a way at odds with the [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=723.4s)]
*  magnitude of this cut, the you know, so why didn't they just [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=731.5600000000001s)]
*  cut 25 basis points? I think people are trying to figure that [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=734.16s)]
*  out. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=737.08s)]
*  Really, he leaves into the 50 because they could just do 25 a [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=737.9200000000001s)]
*  month. Sure. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=742.36s)]
*  Yeah, if the economy is hot, why wouldn't you tiptoe into rate [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=745.9200000000001s)]
*  cuts? And just do 25. Now, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=748.64s)]
*  that's the key thing. If you look at the the dot plot, and if [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=751.72s)]
*  you look at where the smart financial actors are betting [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=754.64s)]
*  where rates end. So it's hard to sort of like look at any point [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=757.24s)]
*  in time 50 now 25 later, what does it all mean? It's very [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=761.5600000000001s)]
*  hard to know. But what is much clearer is, where do we think [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=765.56s)]
*  terminal rates will be in even in the next 18 months? And it is [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=768.9599999999999s)]
*  dramatically lower for where they are now. And I think that [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=772.9599999999999s)]
*  support sacks your that argument that you just made, which is, if [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=775.8399999999999s)]
*  you're going to basically cut this aggressively over the next [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=779.76s)]
*  year to year and a half, by the estimates of very smart [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=783.7199999999999s)]
*  financial actors whose job it is to spend every day observing the [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=787.2399999999999s)]
*  Fed, then they must see something because otherwise, as [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=790.5999999999999s)]
*  you said, you could take a much more gradual approach. And so I [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=794.24s)]
*  think that the smart financial actors are guessing recession or [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=798.08s)]
*  guessing contraction. I think what they're also guessing is [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=803.52s)]
*  similar to nonfarm payrolls. We're going to go through a [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=807.82s)]
*  couple of difficult GDP revisions, probably downward. And [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=811.24s)]
*  I think that will have an impact to people's sense of how the [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=815.72s)]
*  economy is doing even more than what their senses today, which [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=820.04s)]
*  is already teetering on it's at best okay. And I think all of [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=823.12s)]
*  that has to play itself out. So it's going to be a very [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=827.84s)]
*  complicated and dynamic fall in that respect. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=830.44s)]
*  Yeah, and I think so much of this has to do with unemployment. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=833.44s)]
*  We had that period where so many jobs were available. Remember, [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=838.84s)]
*  we talked about it here 1112 jobs available at the peak. We [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=841.6s)]
*  can debate the numbers, of course, but we all saw it where [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=845.36s)]
*  you just couldn't hire talent in America. There was so few people [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=848.28s)]
*  available to take positions and man has that changed and you get [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=852.34s)]
*  to see it on the ground in early stage startups where this whole [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=855.94s)]
*  narrative I don't know if you saw it in your board meetings, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=860.86s)]
*  but hey, we can't find a person. Hey, we're looking Hey, that [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=862.9s)]
*  search is still going. We're still looking for a director [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=865.9s)]
*  sales. We're still looking for salespeople. We're still [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=868.1s)]
*  looking for developers. We're still looking for operations [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=869.94s)]
*  people. Now it's the opposite. It's like, I just I'm hiring [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=872.0600000000001s)]
*  producers here in Austin, because I'm building it my in [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=877.1s)]
*  person studio. We had like, I don't know, a dozen viable [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=879.22s)]
*  candidates for this position. And I had a hard time picking [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=883.3000000000001s)]
*  between, you know, the top three. Now that's distinctly [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=886.84s)]
*  different than my experience for the last five to 10 years where [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=890.94s)]
*  you were like, how do we how do we fill this role? So I think [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=894.5400000000001s)]
*  that employment has been broken. And that's the thing that has [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=897.58s)]
*  me concerned because with all these people who came in through [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=900.74s)]
*  the southern border, and then you have people outsourcing to [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=903.0600000000001s)]
*  other countries, I wonder if Americans are going to lose so [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=907.18s)]
*  many of these mid paying jobs. And this will dovetail into our [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=910.8599999999999s)]

*  economy. I wonder I don't know if you're seeing that in your [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=925.9399999999999s)]

*  I'm not worried about the hollowing out of that that class. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=930.14s)]

*  you know, hiring the talent pool, etc. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=941.1s)]
*  Well, I mean, in tech things are pretty good. I mean, they they're [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=945.5s)]
*  not as absurdly frothy as they were during the bubble of 2020 [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=948.66s)]

*  now. And there's just a ton of investment going into AI. There's [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=956.9s)]
*  a little bit of a tale of two cities going on. If you're in AI, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=960.3s)]
*  things are really bubbly. And if you're outside AI, they're, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=963.3399999999999s)]
*  they've returned to much more normal levels in terms of [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=966.78s)]
*  valuation and company operations, all that kind of [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=970.6999999999999s)]
*  stuff. Just to go back to the state of the economy for a [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=974.54s)]
*  second, the reason why a lot of people were predicting a [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=978.06s)]
*  recession, including me for a while is that the yield curve [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=981.42s)]
*  inverting has been an almost perfect gauge of whether a [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=985.74s)]
*  recession is coming. It's when basically the Fed raises [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=990.02s)]
*  short term interest rates above long term interest rates. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=994.14s)]
*  Normally, long rates are the ones that should be higher [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=996.9s)]
*  because investors demand a higher rate of return to tie up [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1000.42s)]
*  their money for longer. So something's really off and kind [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1003.18s)]
*  of broken when short rates go above long rates, the yield [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1006.74s)]
*  curve inverts. And it's always been the prelude to a recession. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1009.3s)]
*  But the recession doesn't come when the yield curve inverts, it [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1012.9s)]
*  usually comes when the yield curve de inverts. And the reason [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1016.54s)]
*  for that is because the Fed now sees weakness and dramatically [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1019.86s)]
*  cuts the short rates. So in other words, it jacks up the [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1024.38s)]
*  short rates to control inflation. That works, it trickles [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1027.02s)]
*  through the economy, the economy cools down. And then the Fed [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1030.34s)]
*  says, Oh, maybe we've over corrected, they slam on the [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1033.74s)]
*  brakes, and then they cut rates to basically make up for the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1036.6200000000001s)]
*  effect in the economy. So the yield curve has finally de [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1038.74s)]
*  inverted. And the question is just do we now get that [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1042.14s)]
*  recession? Or did the Fed manage this to a soft landing? I don't [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1045.38s)]
*  think we know I'm not. I'm not like calling a recession. But [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1048.78s)]
*  this is the thing that people are concerned about. Yeah. Well, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1052.02s)]
*  Sachs, we were talking about AI in the group chat, right? Yeah, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1055.34s)]
*  I think it's now becoming really clear that call centers are [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1058.14s)]
*  going to be the first really big disruption caused by AI. Yeah. I [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1061.02s)]
*  mean, all the level one customer support is going to get [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1065.6200000000001s)]
*  replaced by AI. I mean, LLM's plus voice, because, you know, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1068.26s)]
*  OpenAI just released their audio API. You saw that at the [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1074.2199999999998s)]
*  All In Summit, we released a Mearsheimer AI. Yeah, where we [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1078.62s)]
*  trained it on all of his work. And you can go to Mearsheimer.ai [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1083.82s)]
*  and ask it questions. And it will tell you the answers in his [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1086.82s)]
*  voice because we cloned his voice using resemble AI. Anyway, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1089.5s)]
*  so AI can do voice now. And it can be trained extremely well on [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1094.06s)]
*  large data sets to give you answers to questions, which is [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1099.9799999999998s)]
*  pretty much what customer support is. So I think it's now [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1103.06s)]
*  becoming clear that I think within the next two to three [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1106.6599999999999s)]
*  years, you're going to see a massive disruption in that. I [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1109.58s)]
*  agree with that massively. And I think there's another under [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1111.7s)]
*  reported story, which is people don't like to call and talk to a [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1114.8999999999999s)]
*  customer service agent like an actual human, if they can avoid [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1120.1399999999999s)]
*  it, they would much rather go on YouTube and say, how do I fix [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1123.7s)]
*  this? Or, you know, ask chat CPT, how do I fix this? It's [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1126.5s)]
*  like, I don't want to waste another person's time. Just give [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1129.82s)]
*  me the answer as quick as possible. And AI will give you [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1132.42s)]
*  the answer quicker. YouTube will give you the answer quicker. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1135.3000000000002s)]
*  I've had so many times where I have people who work for me who [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1138.3000000000002s)]
*  are like, I don't know how to do that. And I literally would walk [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1141.38s)]
*  up to their computer and load YouTube and type in. How do I [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1144.14s)]
*  blank and there's a video there. Watch it on to speed, you can do [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1148.3400000000001s)]
*  it. That's what's, you know, gonna also kill this. Like, I [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1151.5800000000002s)]
*  don't want to talk to a human. Just change my flight. Just, you [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1154.98s)]
*  know, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1159.14s)]
*  but you talk about disruption. Call centers are a very big part [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1159.42s)]
*  of the economy in certain geographies. Denver, Salt Lake, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1164.38s)]
*  I mean, parts of Florida. Yeah, exactly. It's a really big deal. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1168.18s)]
*  If like half the cost gets ripped out of those call [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1172.46s)]
*  centers, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1174.94s)]
*  where would you move those people? If you had your choice, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1175.42s)]
*  could they move to sales? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1178.5800000000002s)]
*  Well, I think sales will be the one that's disrupted after [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1180.42s)]
*  customer support. But I don't know, I think it's gonna be very [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1182.6200000000001s)]
*  disruptive. One of the reasons I think this is, you know, in the [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1186.42s)]
*  early days of LLMs, people were saying that legal services would [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1189.02s)]
*  be disrupted. And you saw some very highly valued startups [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1193.46s)]
*  rocketing up based on that. I think the problem with that is [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1198.42s)]
*  the error rate. So when you think about AI applications, you [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1202.46s)]
*  have to think about what is the tolerable error rate that the [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1208.1399999999999s)]
*  industry will allow? Because we know that AI is getting things [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1212.06s)]
*  wrong, they can hallucinate, and you're never going to be able to [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1215.02s)]
*  make it perfect. I mean, you can improve the quality, but it's [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1217.74s)]
*  still going to have some errors. And when you're dealing with [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1220.14s)]
*  like legal services, for example, you just can't have [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1222.9s)]
*  mistakes. This is not tolerated. However, customer support is [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1225.7s)]
*  different. customer support is already organized into levels, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1229.18s)]
*  level one, level two, level three, based on difficulty. And [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1232.82s)]
*  there's already in a sense, a mechanism for failover. If like [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1236.18s)]
*  the level one customer support person can't answer the [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1239.38s)]
*  question, they kick it up to level two. So there's a place [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1242.58s)]
*  for LLMs to start in customer support, which is replacing all [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1246.74s)]
*  the level one and then working their way up the chain to level [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1251.54s)]
*  two, as they get better and better. And so what I'm saying [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1254.94s)]
*  is that the level of accuracy now, especially with the new [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1258.74s)]
*  PhD level reasoning models is good enough. You don't need to [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1262.54s)]
*  wait for like some perfect LLM model. And I think this is why [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1266.18s)]
*  this is going to be a big, big disruption. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1270.46s)]
*  Let me put you into this. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1272.38s)]
*  Millions of people potentially are going to have their jobs [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1273.3s)]
*  disrupted or at least transformed. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1275.54s)]
*  Well, it could be the end of the entire career as well. Chamath, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1277.3799999999999s)]
*  if you were to look at this four by four, sort of quadrant chart [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1279.86s)]
*  that Sachs is describing, which is the cost of an era, you know, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1283.26s)]
*  and the actual complexity of the job, perhaps, or the cost of the [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1288.22s)]
*  job. How do you look at this? I know you're working on software [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1294.42s)]
*  that kind of does this with your startup as well. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1299.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I'll preview one use case from 8090, which is pretty [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1302.5s)]
*  stunning. You know, we work with a very large regulated, highly [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1310.1s)]
*  regulated company, public company. And they have a very [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1316.42s)]
*  complicated set of people and processes. Because of the the [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1325.14s)]
*  field in which they're in. And David, your point is exactly [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1330.6599999999999s)]
*  right. It took us a fairly long time. But we're at a point now [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1334.74s)]
*  where we've been running AI powered software versus the old [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1342.3s)]
*  legacy deterministic solution. And we've been running it at 100% [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1349.02s)]
*  accuracy now for about 10 days. So this is still very, very [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1353.02s)]
*  so this is still very new. And it's an incredible thing. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1358.8999999999999s)]
*  Because to your point, our first version was like, in the mid [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1362.82s)]
*  80s, then we were in the mid 90s, then we were, you know, 9798%. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1366.46s)]
*  But there were still errors. And it just took a lot of [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1371.86s)]
*  engineering to figure out how to get to 100. But now it's at 100. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1374.78s)]
*  And it's been consistently at 100. And so we're all kind of [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1377.82s)]
*  like scratching our head because now the next step is, well, what [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1380.82s)]
*  do we do? To your point? What do we do? Do we? So we're [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1383.06s)]
*  figuring that out right now. But the art of the possible is that [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1388.38s)]
*  I think well crafted AI software is as good as deterministic [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1395.42s)]
*  software in the sense that the error rates will be equivalent [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1400.0200000000002s)]
*  in production, and at the level of a very highly regulated [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1404.66s)]
*  public company. And I think that's the gold standard, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1410.22s)]
*  because in those sectors, those companies have zero tolerance. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1412.3000000000002s)]
*  It's not a toy. It's not even you know, level one customer [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1416.54s)]
*  support. It's system of record type work. Yeah. But it shows [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1420.18s)]
*  what's possible. And to your point, Sachs, we're doing that [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1425.74s)]
*  today, even though they're the best models. Imagine how good [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1429.22s)]
*  those under the underlying models will get in a year from [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1432.18s)]
*  now. Yeah, right. And I have to take on more and more work. It's [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1434.7s)]
*  it's very stunning. Actually, it's really have you guys worked [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1438.5s)]
*  with the O one preview yet, I just literally have been using [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1441.66s)]
*  this new reasoning engine that open AI released, and it is [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1444.9s)]
*  extraordinary. And it's kind of thinking about the next three or [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1449.14s)]
*  four prompts you would do. And I literally just got this wobbly [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1452.7s)]
*  home show. I've hit the I've hit the limit for my paid account [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1455.7s)]
*  because this thing is so intense on compute, I guess. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1459.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, the thing with the one is that I think it's starting to [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1463.38s)]
*  add reasoning. But the way that you do reasoning is sort of this [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1466.38s)]
*  idea that you have this chain of thought. And I think that that's [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1469.9s)]
*  a very powerful but early concept. And as we refine those [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1473.5s)]
*  ways in which these models get to better answers, the wonderful [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1479.86s)]
*  thing is that open AI will preview or one. And then they'll [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1483.94s)]
*  have the actual one production build probably in the next [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1489.46s)]
*  couple of months, which will be probably pretty spectacular. But [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1492.34s)]
*  then you'll see something from Claude, you'll see something [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1495.1s)]
*  from llama. And the real art, I think, and this is where I do [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1497.46s)]
*  think it's a little bit of alchemy still, which I think is [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1502.5s)]
*  good, because it keeps humans involved, all of us involved. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1505.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1507.86s)]
*  Is how do you stitch all of those things together to get to a [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1509.58s)]
*  0% error rate? What what's accent? You know, how do you [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1513.38s)]
*  minimize the blast radius? And how do you make sure these things [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1515.86s)]
*  are super high quality? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1518.62s)]
*  Right? Well, and people don't, it's still a very hard technical [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1520.42s)]
*  problem. Go ahead, Saxon. Then I'll show you what so one of the [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1523.74s)]
*  reasons why I'm bullish on this customer support use case is [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1526.78s)]
*  because there's a very large data set to train on. You've got [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1529.54s)]
*  all of the product documentation that companies very created. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1532.9s)]
*  You've got all of the previous email support, you know, and [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1535.9s)]
*  calls. Yeah, the calls have been recorded. So you can now train [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1541.14s)]
*  the AI on that. So there's a very large body of data to train [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1543.54s)]
*  the AI model on and it's not necessarily the most proprietary. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1548.22s)]
*  It's not like dealing with people's medical records or even [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1552.06s)]
*  confidential legal documents, something like that. So the data [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1556.22s)]
*  is readily available and then the foundation models are [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1559.02s)]
*  getting really good. I think there's a big question here [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1561.3799999999999s)]
*  about value capture, which is there's a number of startups now [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1564.1399999999999s)]
*  that are becoming very highly valued that are chasing this [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1568.18s)]
*  disruption, this sort of customer support agent [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1571.5s)]
*  disruption. And they're getting into very high valuations, even [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1574.3799999999999s)]
*  unicorn valuations already. And the question is, well, wait, if [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1579.34s)]
*  if the foundation models are advancing at such a rate, like a [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1583.18s)]
*  year from now, why couldn't like a developer, just a startup [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1586.7s)]
*  of a few guys take next year's model, and train it and then [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1590.54s)]
*  commoditize the [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1594.42s)]
*  you're making such a good point this. So when we were trying to [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1597.26s)]
*  figure out like what applications we would build and [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1600.7s)]
*  like which sectors of the economy we would go after, I was [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1603.82s)]
*  like, guys, we got to go after the hardest, most regulated [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1607.22s)]
*  places. Because those are the things and places and people that [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1611.02s)]
*  have absolutely zero tolerance for error, and where you're going [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1615.14s)]
*  to need to do some amount of customization and, and [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1619.3000000000002s)]
*  specialization to actually solve these problems. And sacks to [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1622.1000000000001s)]
*  your point, like when you see and I said, you cannot, we [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1626.46s)]
*  cannot touch customer service, we cannot touch it, because it's [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1628.7s)]
*  going to get commoditized and run over by these foundational [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1631.7800000000002s)]
*  models within a year. Right? You'll be able to deploy these. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1636.42s)]
*  It's just too easy. You'll be able to do it on a local [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1640.98s)]
*  computer. I mean, you'll just download the entire database of [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1643.28s)]
*  every call on a MacBook with an M3. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1646.0s)]
*  Build on that. That the other thing that's now possible, and [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1649.28s)]
*  you saw this with Klarna, because Klarna put out this, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1652.16s)]
*  like cryptic tweet slash press release, where I think maybe was [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1654.72s)]
*  in their earnings, Nick, maybe you can find this, but they're [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1658.5s)]
*  like, we've deprecated Salesforce and worked it. That [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1660.28s)]
*  is like strange. How, how can a company that big deprecate those [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1664.24s)]
*  two systems of record? How is that even? It's how is it? I [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1669.0s)]
*  think it means they're writing their own, right? Well, I'll [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1672.28s)]
*  tell you how it's possible. And so this is like this next crazy [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1674.48s)]
*  thing that's been happening. We've been doing a version of [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1677.6399999999999s)]
*  this to go after some other sources of software, we haven't [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1680.74s)]
*  had the balls to be honest, to go have since for workday. But [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1683.2s)]
*  here's how they do it. They write these agents. And these [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1688.72s)]
*  agents can spawn other agents, right? So it's very classic kind [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1692.72s)]
*  of machine that builds a machine. And you start to observe [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1695.68s)]
*  the inputs and outputs of a system, right? I'm hyper [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1699.16s)]
*  simplifying, but I'm just it'll make the point. And over time, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1702.18s)]
*  what the agents start to do is by observing the inputs and the [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1706.0600000000002s)]
*  outputs, they start to guess on what the intervening code is. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1708.76s)]
*  And the code paths must be in the middle to generate the [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1712.1200000000001s)]
*  outputs based on these inputs. And so over time, what happens [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1714.64s)]
*  is you develop a digital twin. And then you run that against [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1718.48s)]
*  that counterfactual against workday or Salesforce. And then [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1724.14s)]
*  at some point, you're like, it's the same. And you just turn [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1727.72s)]
*  it off. And you're saving yourself 10s or 100s of millions [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1731.6000000000001s)]
*  of dollars. So that's, it's a version of what Karna did. It [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1734.84s)]
*  takes an enormous amount of technical strength to do it. It [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1738.88s)]
*  also takes tremendous, I think, executive courage and [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1744.0s)]
*  leadership, because I think that's a very difficult decision [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1747.28s)]
*  to embark on. But if you're an engineer, that must be an [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1749.68s)]
*  unbelievably exciting technical challenge to be a part of but [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1753.48s)]
*  that's the basic premise of what they were able to do. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1757.72s)]
*  Hopefully they share more and maybe they even open source what [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1761.28s)]
*  they did because I think it would just be an amazing thing [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1764.32s)]
*  for all of us to look at. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1768.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, to restate it, watch people use a piece of [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1770.04s)]
*  software. And then based on what they do, you could write a code [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1773.72s)]
*  which you could take a video of a video game today, like Angry [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1777.72s)]
*  Birds, and somebody did this, you give the Angry Birds, iPad, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1782.32s)]
*  you know, game from 15 years ago, to AI, it's going to back [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1786.12s)]
*  into the code just by watching it. So why not just watch [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1789.92s)]
*  people use Salesforce or Workday. And those are very [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1793.8799999999999s)]
*  expensive products, thousands of dollars per user, right? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1796.84s)]
*  I want to I want to get Sax's point of view, like the thing in [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1799.52s)]
*  enterprise software that we were always told is you cannot touch [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1801.8799999999999s)]
*  these systems of record. Don't ever start a systems of record [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1804.96s)]
*  company, don't try to touch these systems of record [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1808.0s)]
*  companies, don't, you know, try to disrupt them. It's an [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1810.52s)]
*  impossible task. But then the question is, if you have these [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1813.28s)]
*  things, why do you necessarily need a system of record in the [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1817.6s)]
*  way that you needed to before when you're writing all this [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1822.12s)]
*  clunky deterministic? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1825.04s)]
*  What do you think? Well, I saw the Klanos story where they said [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1826.44s)]
*  they were going to rip out Salesforce and Workday because [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1829.6399999999999s)]
*  they're able to write their own bespoke code using AI. I mean, I [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1832.6399999999999s)]
*  have to say I'm a little bit skeptical of that story for a [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1836.24s)]
*  couple of reasons. One is, if that's their goal, why wouldn't [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1838.92s)]
*  they have open source this these products they created, you [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1842.88s)]
*  might as well get the whole ecosystem working on it because [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1845.64s)]

*  created. They're just trying to rip out the cost. So why not let [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1851.64s)]
*  the whole ecosystem see it? The other thing is, if it's so easy [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1854.3600000000001s)]
*  to do, why hasn't the market already been flooded with new [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1859.1200000000001s)]
*  startups that are effectively able to reverse engineer? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1862.68s)]
*  I don't think you're right. I don't think it's easy to do [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1866.0800000000002s)]
*  because I don't think there's a generalization here. That's [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1868.0s)]
*  productizable. Do you know what I mean? Like, I do think that [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1871.0s)]
*  these are very custom specific things. So maybe there's like [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1873.76s)]
*  some scaffolding. But I don't think that that scaffolding has [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1877.88s)]
*  a ton of economic value. I think it's really good open source [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1880.64s)]
*  stuff. Yeah, I think it's what you build on top of it. And so [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1883.36s)]
*  that hasn't been figured out yet, for sure. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1887.16s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think that if you're only using a few use [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1889.76s)]
*  cases of these big, complicated software packages, then yeah, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1893.76s)]
*  it's probably easier than ever to deprecate them, you know, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1897.72s)]
*  eliminate them from your stack and just have your own internal [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1901.52s)]

*  Here's the tweet. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1913.4s)]
*  This is a crazy one. Yeah. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1914.72s)]
*  So so look at but look at the code. Look at the actual product [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1918.16s)]
*  itself for a second. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1921.8s)]
*  Yeah, but the products garbage. I mean, look how ridiculous this [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1923.4s)]
*  But that was 600. Sorry, it was a billion dollars that [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1926.28s)]
*  paid Oracle 600 million to build our course management portal. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1933.4s)]

*  a year for hosting. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1946.24s)]

*  site looks like it's pathetic. I mean, honestly, this looks like [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1951.56s)]
*  it, a it could have been done with a SharePoint site, and you [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1955.8799999999999s)]
*  pay some consultants to stand it up and for 1% of the cost. And [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1958.8799999999999s)]
*  there are better plot more modern platforms than that. So [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1963.8799999999999s)]
*  this is just incredibly wasteful and inefficient government [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1967.12s)]
*  spending. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1971.48s)]

*  90s. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1977.28s)]
*  The reason I wanted to I wanted to show this to you is I think [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1978.52s)]
*  that these kinds of things will not be possible in the future. I [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1981.1599999999999s)]
*  just don't see how one could spend a billion dollars if one [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1984.48s)]
*  tried to to enable that feature. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1990.24s)]
*  Right, but that that that's 600 million that was wasted on that [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1993.6799999999998s)]
*  crappy portal that shouldn't have happened even without AI. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=1997.52s)]
*  Because there's like much better ways there you can you could buy [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2001.76s)]
*  a much better product for 1% of the cost. So or point 1% of the [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2005.56s)]
*  cost. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2009.32s)]
*  There must be some regulatory capture going here where [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2009.76s)]
*  somebody's got a record. No, like a tenure ships. That's a [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2012.48s)]
*  10 year relationship with somebody in Albany that you [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2016.6s)]

*  happening with rural internet. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2024.24s)]
*  Yeah, she's our paradox. It's our next story. So let's go for [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2026.96s)]
*  it. In related news of our government burning our money. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2031.72s)]
*  We're all broadband rural broad and an EV charging $42 [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2037.08s)]
*  billion and 7.5 billion almost $50 billion combined. Let's just [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2041.8s)]
*  go over these two programs real quickly here. Both were part of [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2046.6000000000001s)]
*  the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in 2021 42 billion carved [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2050.2s)]
*  out to provide high speed internet to people living on [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2055.68s)]
*  farms in rural locations. 7.5 billion carved out to build [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2059.64s)]
*  500,000 EV chargers over 10 years. It's been 1000 days since [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2063.12s)]
*  the bill was passed. So let's check on the progress. Zero [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2068.24s)]
*  people have been connected. According to FCC Commissioner [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2070.96s)]
*  Brendan Carr, and eight 12345678 EV chargers have been built as [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2074.3599999999997s)]
*  of May, according to Auto Week magazine, what's even crazier. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2081.7599999999998s)]
*  Private industry already solved these problems. United Airlines [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2085.96s)]
*  just announced they're putting Starlink on 1000 of their planes. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2089.64s)]
*  And they're going to offer it for free. And Starlink now has [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2094.44s)]
*  2500 planes under contract with a bunch of other airlines. And in [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2097.68s)]
*  the second half of 2023 alone, the private sector built over 1000 [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2104.04s)]
*  charging stations in the US. These are two problems that have [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2108.68s)]
*  already been solved. Saks. Why are we burning $50 billion in [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2112.44s)]
*  the future with things that have already been solved? We've [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2119.56s)]
*  solved for this. You I own electric cars. I have the answer. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2125.12s)]
*  You know the answer. Say the answer, Jason corruption. No, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2128.92s)]
*  come on, Jason incompetence. Really? graph. Keep going. I [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2132.76s)]
*  mean, you tell me with corruption, graft, buying votes [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2139.44s)]
*  from your constituents. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2143.88s)]
*  They haven't they haven't delivered any of it. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2146.6s)]
*  Incompetence. Yes. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2148.64s)]
*  Well, there's there's a couple things going on here. So one is [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2150.96s)]
*  typical government waste, fraud and abuse, where they've [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2154.1600000000003s)]
*  allocated 42 billion for rural internet haven't hooked anyone [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2158.8s)]
*  up. And we could spend a fraction of that giving people [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2161.88s)]
*  starling and allowing the private sector to do its job. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2165.56s)]
*  And why even pay for it? Saks? Why are we paying for it? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2169.36s)]
*  If it's available for 100 bucks? [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2172.16s)]
*  That that's the baseline. But it's worse than that. Because on [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2174.04s)]
*  top of the waste, fraud and abuse and the fact that the [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2177.7599999999998s)]
*  government is grossly incompetent and efficient. You [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2179.72s)]
*  also have naked political retaliation going on here. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2183.16s)]
*  Ah, that's the answer. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2186.08s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. And Brendan Carr, who's an FCC Commissioner, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2187.64s)]
*  pointed this out. He said that in 2023, the FCC canceled or [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2190.56s)]
*  revoked an $885 million contract with the company by claiming [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2197.24s)]
*  Starlink is not capable of providing high speed internet. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2201.12s)]
*  Then later, of course, that was a lie. And then a year later, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2204.04s)]
*  the FCC is now claiming that Starlink provides so much high [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2209.6s)]
*  speed internet that the word monopoly should be tossed out. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2212.28s)]
*  Yeah. So look, this is just which is it's pure naked [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2216.0s)]
*  retaliation. The Biden-Harris administration doesn't want to [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2220.24s)]
*  admit that Elon has the best solution for rural internet, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2224.2s)]
*  just like they couldn't admit he made the best electric cars. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2228.3999999999996s)]
*  Remember when they did that EV summit and they didn't invite [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2231.08s)]
*  him? That was just nakedly political because he's not [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2233.12s)]
*  human. Right. So look, I mean, the Biden-Harris administration, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2237.2799999999997s)]
*  look, it's blue no matter who. And Elon has drifted from being [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2241.3199999999997s)]
*  sort of independent and not aligned to [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2246.9599999999996s)]
*  He was blue. He's no longer team blue. And so they're punishing [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2250.3999999999996s)]
*  him for this. Yeah. Well, it's costing taxpayers a huge amount [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2256.72s)]
*  of money. I think this is one of the worst decisions by the [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2259.72s)]
*  current administration. And if Trump gets in there, he should [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2262.72s)]
*  reverse it on day one. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2265.8799999999997s)]
*  Well, I mean, you need to investigate. I mean, I think how [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2267.2s)]
*  we got to the point of wasting $50 billion. That requires an [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2269.6s)]
*  investigation. I think. Chamath, your thoughts? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2275.3599999999997s)]
*  One comment is, and this is so sad, but I'm so desensitized by [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2277.16s)]
*  the amount of waste that I don't know whether 50 billion is a lot [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2281.88s)]
*  or a little anymore when it comes to the United States [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2285.68s)]
*  government. Isn't that sad? Like, because now everything I [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2287.88s)]
*  hear is in hundreds of billions and trillions, but 50 billion is [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2291.36s)]
*  an enormous amount of money. Right? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2296.44s)]
*  Well, that's a good point. I remember, you know, back in the [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2298.8s)]
*  day, 60 Minutes used to do these segments on waste, fraud, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2301.92s)]
*  and abuse at the Pentagon, different parts of the [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2307.2000000000003s)]
*  government, $42 billion just spent on something that really [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2308.88s)]
*  taxpayers could have for free or without the government getting [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2313.16s)]
*  involved. And you know, 42 billion that was lining someone's [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2315.6800000000003s)]
*  pocket when the service doesn't even work. That would have been [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2318.84s)]
*  a scandal. And the media would have covered it. But the media [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2320.84s)]
*  doesn't even cover it these days. And again, it's because [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2323.96s)]
*  the media has become so tribal that it's better dead than red [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2326.16s)]
*  and blue, no matter who. And so because the media would have to [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2330.68s)]
*  admit that Elon's already solved this problem, they just can't go [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2334.24s)]
*  there. They won't even cover this. And so we have no [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2337.56s)]
*  accountability. There's no accountability on the [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2340.3999999999996s)]
*  government. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2342.7599999999998s)]
*  If I had to just take a step back and just generalize going [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2343.44s)]
*  forward, do we want to live in the kind of administrative state [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2346.3199999999997s)]
*  where they will pick people that they dislike, based on totally [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2353.4s)]
*  random criteria, a tweet, a meme, a post, and then all of a [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2361.4s)]
*  sudden punish a bunch of the rest of us because of that. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2367.52s)]
*  They're punishing all of America, because they collect [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2371.56s)]
*  our taxes to waste on it. And then they punish the people that [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2374.64s)]
*  they actually say they're going to uplift by not delivering what [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2378.6s)]
*  they promised. And if you take Elon out of it for a second, the [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2381.56s)]
*  problem was when we cross the chasm and did it with the first [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2386.52s)]
*  guy, him. But the reality is there's only one of him and then [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2390.16s)]
*  there's a lot of the rest of us. And what will happen is people [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2393.72s)]
*  just get added to this list of folks that certain nameless [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2396.7599999999998s)]
*  faceless people in the administrative state dislike. And [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2403.48s)]
*  what happens is the country slows down, and the country wastes [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2407.32s)]
*  money and the country pilfers it away. And that has to stop. And [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2410.48s)]
*  so what really bothers me about these things is a, I don't know [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2414.4s)]
*  how to undesensitize myself to the fact that all of a sudden [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2418.56s)]
*  now because of just all of this sloppy waste, I didn't react as [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2421.64s)]
*  much as I should have to just $50 billion being flushed down the [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2427.28s)]
*  toilet on these two projects. And then to Jason, your point, it [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2430.28s)]
*  is a solved problem that you can give incredibly cheaply. And [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2434.76s)]
*  the fact that it's not left private enterprise to solve [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2440.44s)]
*  this, and instead, it's just brazen partisanship combined [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2444.04s)]
*  with retaliation combined with incompetence. And buying votes [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2447.7200000000003s)]
*  by giving this money to other vendors who are giving them [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2451.64s)]
*  donations. And just to give the democrats their due, what [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2455.32s)]
*  happens if then Trump does the same thing for a solution that [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2458.48s)]
*  you support and you need and you think should be everywhere. The [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2461.64s)]
*  point is, we don't want any of this stuff. Under any [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2465.04s)]
*  administration and that point it's and the minute that one [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2468.32s)]
*  administration breaks the seal, and makes it acceptable, it [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2471.7200000000003s)]
*  becomes part of the water table. And that's the real problem. We [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2476.4s)]
*  broke the seal on this crazy multi multi trillion dollar [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2480.7200000000003s)]
*  spending and it is just never stopped since then. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2484.04s)]
*  And you know, the incentives really matter. If you look at a [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2487.0800000000004s)]
*  private company, if you were at Klarna and to our previous [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2491.28s)]
*  story, and you go to the boss and say, I know how to get rid [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2494.32s)]
*  of these, this wasteful spending we're doing here, we [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2497.2s)]
*  can get rid of all tier one calls with AI and save that [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2500.04s)]
*  money, you get a promotion. If you're in the government, you [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2503.0s)]
*  can't if you're a politician and you cut this program, your [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2507.3199999999997s)]
*  constituents get upset, you don't have that stuff being [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2510.8399999999997s)]
*  built in your district. There's a perverse incentive that you [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2513.7999999999997s)]
*  can't buy the votes, which is why these folks are constantly [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2516.9199999999996s)]
*  trying to buy votes. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2519.7999999999997s)]
*  And the good news is, the good news is, I really applaud the [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2521.12s)]
*  people that have the courage to show this stuff on X to tweet [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2525.44s)]
*  this stuff out so that the rest of us know about it and the [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2530.04s)]
*  person that talked about the NYC thing. But then the next step [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2533.28s)]
*  has to happen, which is that we all need to decide that this [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2537.2000000000003s)]
*  stuff needs to stop, otherwise it's going to bankrupt our [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2540.16s)]
*  country. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2542.44s)]
*  And we have to celebrate it. That's the key if we can [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2543.04s)]
*  celebrate people saving money again, like Malay is getting a [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2545.84s)]
*  lot of credit. And that's up to us, leadership and podcasting [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2549.68s)]
*  or the media, or influential people who have followings, if [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2553.6s)]
*  you point out, hey, this is a waste, go save this money, and [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2556.4s)]
*  somebody does save the money. Well, why don't we start [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2559.48s)]
*  celebrating people saving the money and doing the right thing [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2561.6s)]
*  here? Because this is our children's future. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2564.12s)]
*  Is it true that Kamala was the broadband czar that was [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2567.08s)]
*  responsible for this thing? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2570.48s)]
*  I mean, it's who knows? [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2571.7999999999997s)]
*  No, because I saw it. I saw that a bunch of senators wrote a [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2573.68s)]
*  letter to her. And they claim that she was the broadband czar. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2577.24s)]
*  But I don't know if that's true or not true. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2581.08s)]
*  And whether she was [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2583.6s)]
*  I mean, we just remember she was the AI czar. I mean, the [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2584.52s)]
*  administration did put her nominally in charge of various [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2587.36s)]
*  technology initiatives. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2591.24s)]
*  Here's an idea. Save money, get the get the best solution at the [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2592.64s)]
*  lowest price and then reevaluate that as you go. And I just want [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2596.92s)]
*  to point out with the it's a this is a subtle point. But [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2599.88s)]
*  Elon also open sourced his patents for the superchargers and [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2603.92s)]
*  let anybody do them. And he opened up the superchargers to [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2608.16s)]
*  other vehicles, which he didn't have to do. And when they gave [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2611.96s)]
*  him a loan, back in the cylinder days and the fiscal days, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2615.68s)]
*  remember, they gave these incentives in the form of loans, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2619.44s)]
*  he's the only guy who paid it back, everybody else failed. So [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2622.0s)]
*  now you're punishing the guy who actually built the [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2624.88s)]
*  infrastructure for both of these projects. So the reward for [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2627.44s)]
*  actually doing the right thing, which Starlink did SpaceX did [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2631.2400000000002s)]
*  and Tesla did, is to be punished. And then you're giving [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2634.76s)]
*  a leg up to somebody else who's building these charts, who's [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2637.96s)]
*  more qualified to build these charges at scale, or a satellite [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2640.4s)]
*  network at scale, the person who's already done it, he's [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2644.08s)]
*  already done it. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2646.76s)]
*  I do worry that there's a growing version of the Elon [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2647.76s)]
*  derangement syndrome that's also kind of like festering. Yeah, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2651.92s)]
*  for sure. Which just it just stops people from thinking [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2655.84s)]
*  rationally. Of course. I mean, we're talking about laying fiber [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2659.2400000000002s)]
*  lines, cable modems to people who are hundreds of miles into [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2663.6800000000003s)]
*  the countryside. That makes no sense when you can just put a [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2668.08s)]
*  satellite dish up today. What are we even talking about? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2672.44s)]
*  I mean, government has never been particularly efficient. But [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2676.0s)]
*  there was a period of time where people would at least care about [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2679.64s)]
*  wanting to make it more efficient. And it would be a [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2683.36s)]
*  scandal if there was political corruption to try and bias the [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2686.24s)]
*  result in a way that actually deprived the intended [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2689.48s)]
*  recipients of the program from getting the services they're [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2693.88s)]
*  supposed to get and cost the government way more money than [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2695.92s)]
*  it needed to. We're so far beyond being that country [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2698.48s)]
*  anymore, where we actually debate the best policy. We're [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2702.44s)]
*  now it's just like we're warring political tribes. And the [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2707.36s)]
*  objective of the party is to punish its political opponents [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2711.6800000000003s)]
*  to engage in retaliation, and to basically loot the public [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2717.08s)]
*  coffers as much as possible on behalf of their constituents. And [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2720.36s)]
*  that's what's basically happening. You know, it's [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2723.76s)]
*  completely dysfunctional. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2725.88s)]
*  Well, let's use this podcast. If you see government waste, tell [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2727.0s)]
*  us. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2729.6800000000003s)]
*  And no one really cares because the media doesn't really shine a [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2730.2400000000002s)]
*  light on it because they're they're completely tribalized as [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2732.88s)]
*  well. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2735.5200000000004s)]
*  I agree with everything you're saying except the last part. I [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2735.84s)]
*  don't think it's on behalf of their constituents. I don't think [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2738.0s)]
*  any of us see any benefit from any of this spend. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2740.1200000000003s)]
*  No, no, I meant their donors, the donor constituents. There's [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2743.44s)]
*  just not not the citizens of the country. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2746.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. But who but who's winning in this? It's not like [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2749.36s)]
*  this 42 is 42 billion lining the pockets of I don't know, names [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2752.2000000000003s)]
*  are sure. How do you think? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2756.52s)]
*  For sure. All those companies that are gonna lay that fiber [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2757.6800000000003s)]
*  are going to get that money. And then and then they're going to [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2760.36s)]
*  40,000. But it's been it's been three or four years they haven't [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2762.84s)]
*  done a single thing. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2766.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, I still think they're cash the checks. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2767.48s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like we're at the stage of just pure incompetence [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2770.4s)]
*  and retaliation. We're not even at the stage of actually then [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2773.1200000000003s)]
*  giving it to anybody else. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2775.4s)]
*  I mean, that would be so they're giving the money away. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2777.64s)]
*  They're not getting the political benefit from it. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2781.6s)]
*  They're so incompetent, they can't get out of their own way. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2784.24s)]
*  But somebody is getting that call it 50 billion that we don't [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2786.0s)]
*  need to spend. And the way that money is awarded is going to be [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2789.7999999999997s)]
*  political. We're going to think that they're going to turn around [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2793.64s)]
*  and get big political contributions. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2796.0s)]
*  Of course. Well, I think I think that I think the good news is [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2797.96s)]
*  that the more of these things we shine a light on, the harder it'll [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2800.2799999999997s)]
*  be to hide when these grants are actually given or what the [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2803.64s)]
*  execution is. And, and to your point, let's start a running [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2808.68s)]
*  list. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2812.3599999999997s)]
*  No, to your point, sacks, maybe like, you know, we need a revival [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2812.8799999999997s)]
*  of the 60 minutes, you know, waste fraud and abuse. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2815.96s)]
*  On this program, we'll do it at the end of the show every time [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2818.92s)]
*  we'll have a running list at all in comm of just every one of [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2821.16s)]
*  these scandals and we'll feature it. So leak it to us first, send [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2825.3199999999997s)]
*  it to us. My DMs are open. All right, listen, early stage [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2828.72s)]
*  investing has always been hard. There was a tweet storm this [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2831.88s)]
*  week that Y Combinator might be having a hard time replicating [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2834.4s)]
*  their early success. We'll discuss it now. A thread this [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2837.88s)]
*  week from ex user Molson Hart caught a couple people's eyes. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2840.88s)]
*  He made the case that it's been a rough decade for YC based on [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2844.88s)]
*  the accelerators top companies page. YC lists as top companies [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2847.52s)]
*  by 2023 revenue there. And you'll notice there's not a lot [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2851.84s)]
*  of companies from the recent cohorts of the 50 companies [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2855.92s)]
*  featured only three are from the classes after 2020. Most of them [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2858.32s)]
*  being from the early 2010s. Obviously, that's because they've [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2861.84s)]
*  been around longer, but it sparked a big discussion that [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2865.8s)]
*  there were so many winners from the 2009 to 2016 era. And that [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2869.52s)]
*  maybe the class size that YC has expanded a whole bunch. And [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2874.2000000000003s)]
*  maybe that's part of the problem. But there's a bigger [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2878.6800000000003s)]
*  problem in VC that we've talked about here. Here's a chart from [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2880.8s)]
*  Carta that just shows the percentage of VC funds that have [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2884.7200000000003s)]
*  made a distribution since 2017. Over 40% of 2018 vintage funds [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2887.84s)]
*  have not made a single distribution yet. And it's [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2893.36s)]
*  getting to the point year five, six or seven where you probably [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2896.96s)]
*  should have had some distributions occur. Obviously, a [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2899.84s)]
*  lot of this has to do with maybe M&A and those early wins being [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2903.08s)]
*  taken off the table. We've talked about that a whole bunch. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2906.56s)]
*  But here's the chart. That kind of gets really interesting. An [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2910.28s)]
*  explosion in fund managers occurred, as we all know, and [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2915.08s)]
*  this chart shows from pitch book, the first time, first [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2918.2s)]
*  time VC managers that raised a second VC fund as a share of all [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2921.88s)]
*  first time VC managers, and it's now down from above 50% to below [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2925.4s)]
*  gosh, 15%. So what are your thoughts here? Chama? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2932.88s)]
*  My gosh, venture is a really, really tough business. Every [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2937.12s)]
*  year, for the last seven, six years, seven years, I have [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2942.6s)]
*  published my returns, which most VCs don't want to do. I do it [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2947.96s)]
*  because I go back and I look at it. And I think having public [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2954.2s)]
*  accountability actually drives some good decisions. They, they [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2958.68s)]
*  may seem suboptimal in the moment, but they in the long run, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2962.7599999999998s)]
*  turn out to be good decisions. And the biggest one has been [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2967.8399999999997s)]
*  generating liquidity. So Nick, you can throw up this thing. But [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2971.88s)]
*  I'm sure there are funds in each of these vintages that have done [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2976.52s)]
*  way better than me. So I'm not I'm not saying you know, it is [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2979.36s)]
*  what it is. But what I want to point out is, if I go and look [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2982.2400000000002s)]
*  inside of these funds and tell you how hard it has been to [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2986.44s)]
*  generate this DPI, it's like, it's like dragging an entire [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2988.88s)]
*  just [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2996.12s)]
*  sack of potatoes. Oh, my gosh, it's like, like a [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=2998.28s)]
*  truck of dead bodies over a finish line. It is super, super [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3001.88s)]
*  hard. And the things that we have fought are two. One is that [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3006.52s)]
*  the gestation of companies has totally blown out. We used to be [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3012.76s)]
*  in a world where by year five, six or seven, you could return [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3017.1600000000003s)]
*  money. You just can't do that anymore, unless you get [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3020.2000000000003s)]
*  extraordinarily lucky, which by the way, I got when sax was [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3022.84s)]
*  running Yammer. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3026.08s)]
*  It was an enormous win for all of us. But that is just [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3026.84s)]
*  exceptionally rare. And that was m&a in year one, five or six [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3030.2000000000003s)]
*  sacks. There's so few there's so few entrepreneurs capable of [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3034.04s)]
*  that he's one of maybe five or 10. So other than that, I've [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3036.92s)]
*  never really had a company that has generated liquidity in year [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3041.8s)]
*  five, six or seven, they've always generated if they did [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3046.1600000000003s)]
*  generated it at all, in years 1112 and 13. And so the problem [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3049.28s)]
*  with that is that at some point, you have these paper marks that [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3055.76s)]
*  say you're winning, and things are working. But there's no [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3060.12s)]
*  path to liquidity. So then I what I did was I stepped in to [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3063.96s)]
*  the secondary markets, and I would sell. And it would really [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3068.68s)]
*  upset certain founders. But I was very clear that when I was [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3073.28s)]
*  running outside capital, and I was running outside capital on [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3078.92s)]
*  behalf of really the organizations that I believed in, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3082.32s)]
*  the Broad Foundation, the Mayo clinics, Memorial Sloan [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3086.56s)]
*  Kettering, my job was to get the money back, you know, these were [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3089.1600000000003s)]
*  their pension funds, these were the things that they use to [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3093.0s)]
*  build facilities, cancer research, cancer research, I [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3095.6800000000003s)]
*  didn't have the, you know, ability to just sit on my hands [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3099.2400000000002s)]
*  and say, Oh, you know what, you're 15, don't worry. So it's [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3102.7200000000003s)]
*  just meant to say that the tactics of generating liquidity [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3107.32s)]
*  and venture are very misunderstood, and very [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3111.44s)]
*  underappreciated. And even then, you sell some things that are [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3115.7200000000003s)]
*  just absolute winners that had you waited another five or six [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3120.2000000000003s)]
*  years, would have turned another, you know, one or two [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3123.08s)]
*  turns. But that's not the job. The job is not to maximize [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3125.96s)]
*  absolute every single win, the job is to return capital in a [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3130.92s)]
*  reasonable time period, so that your investors don't run out of [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3134.68s)]
*  money to give. Yeah, it's, it's a tough game, man. It is really, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3138.52s)]
*  really, really tough. Yeah. And the the insight, and sorry, by [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3142.92s)]
*  the way, and I feel this now, because, you know, the last five [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3145.88s)]
*  or six years has been entirely my own capital. And my gosh, it's [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3148.7599999999998s)]
*  hard. Yeah, managing liquidity is impossible, especially when [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3152.2s)]
*  you can't rely on anybody else. So well, thank God for the [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3156.56s)]
*  secondary markets even emerging, because at the same time that [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3160.12s)]
*  the secondary markets emerged, and people were willing to buy [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3163.52s)]
*  venture assets, you know, going into their second decade, I [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3167.16s)]
*  would have been in real trouble without the without reasonably [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3170.3199999999997s)]
*  liquid, myself included, I mean, my numbers, my numbers would be [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3172.8799999999997s)]
*  a quarter of what they are. Yeah, and I took advantage of [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3176.72s)]
*  almost every time I had one of those opportunities to sell some [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3179.6s)]
*  shares, pair some positions. And that's how we got our DPI as [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3183.04s)]
*  well. Because, let's face it, Lena con and the anti tech [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3185.7999999999997s)]
*  sentiment has led to these large companies, not buying startups. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3189.3599999999997s)]
*  And instead, they compete with them, they just say, we'll build [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3195.12s)]
*  it in house, because you're not letting us buy it. And it's [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3197.6s)]
*  broken the entire ecosystem. Now, that's broken, the IPO [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3200.6s)]
*  process is broken. I tried to flip that on its head with [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3204.92s)]
*  specs, you know, some work, some didn't, many didn't. In the end, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3212.04s)]
*  many of mine didn't work out at the end, there was a period [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3216.2400000000002s)]
*  where it looked like it was working. But these are all [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3218.7200000000003s)]
*  attempts at changing the liquidity cycle of these [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3221.4s)]
*  companies, because the way that things stand today, we are not [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3226.0s)]
*  in a sustainable industry. It is if you raise funds and think [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3230.04s)]
*  about fee generation. But it is not if you think about returning [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3234.04s)]
*  money to founders, LPs, getting employees compensated for many [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3237.6800000000003s)]
*  years of oil that they put in. It's very tough game right now. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3241.88s)]
*  Well, sacks right now we're seeing people do things like [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3245.96s)]
*  selling you know, their early SpaceX or their early stripe, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3249.6800000000003s)]
*  whatever it is, to other VCs to later stage funds, a lot of ways [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3252.92s)]
*  to try to secure DPI. What's your thoughts on the state of [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3258.1600000000003s)]
*  venture today, given all this data that we're looking at [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3261.56s)]
*  today? [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3264.44s)]
*  Well, two points. So first, I agree with Chamath that the [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3265.36s)]
*  amount of time it takes to generate an outcome for, I'd [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3268.84s)]
*  say most startups is longer than the 10 year period of these [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3272.7200000000003s)]
*  funds. And these funds can be extended up to 12 years usually, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3276.56s)]
*  but then what do you do after that? It just takes a lot [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3279.7999999999997s)]
*  longer than that, in a lot of cases to generate a meaningful [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3282.7599999999998s)]
*  outcome. I just had two companies that I invested in, in [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3285.12s)]
*  my second fund. So in 2019, and 2020. So four years ago, and [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3288.88s)]
*  five years ago, just got marked up. And it was a big markup that [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3293.56s)]
*  companies doing well, I call them late bloomers. It took four [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3297.88s)]
*  to five years for them to accomplish what they wanted to [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3300.64s)]
*  in terms of like building out the tech. I mean, I invested in [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3304.12s)]
*  like the earliest stage. So that's how long it took. And now [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3306.2799999999997s)]
*  they just did growth rounds, and they're kind of off to the [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3309.52s)]
*  races. But, you know, I could easily be 10 years from here to [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3311.3599999999997s)]
*  get to a liquidity event. So you're talking about more like [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3315.12s)]
*  15 year funds. So I agree with that point. The second thing, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3318.4s)]
*  though, is that the big thing that's happened in our industry [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3321.7999999999997s)]
*  is we had a bubble in 2020, and especially 2021. And we just had [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3325.6s)]
*  a ton of capital come into the industry because the Fed and the [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3331.76s)]
*  federal government airdrop $10 trillion liquidity onto the [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3336.2000000000003s)]
*  economy in reaction to COVID. And not all that money went into [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3339.84s)]
*  VC, it went into a lot of places, but the VC industry was [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3344.2000000000003s)]
*  flooded with cash. And you see this in the deployments. I mean, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3347.1200000000003s)]
*  in those bubble years, there was something like 200 billion a [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3351.2000000000003s)]
*  year of capital deployment when normally it's 60 to 100 billion. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3354.0800000000004s)]
*  So if twice the amount of money is going into the industry and is [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3358.0s)]
*  being deployed, and rounds are now twice as big and valuations [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3361.6s)]
*  are twice as big, that has a huge outcome, a huge effect on [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3365.2s)]
*  returns. So for example, the average venture fund is like a [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3369.2799999999997s)]
*  2x return. But if the entry prices were artificially double, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3372.56s)]
*  then there goes your return right there you get to 1x. So [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3378.2799999999997s)]
*  such I think we're just in the hangover of this massive [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3381.16s)]
*  liquidity bubble that didn't originate in the venture capital [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3384.52s)]
*  industry, it came from, frankly, the federal government. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3388.52s)]
*  But we're just downstream of that. Now, what I would say is I [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3392.0s)]
*  do think we're at the tail end of working that out. And the good [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3395.16s)]
*  news is that we now have maybe the most exciting tech wave [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3398.36s)]
*  ever, which is AI, definitely the most exciting tech wave [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3402.36s)]
*  since the internet came along in the mid to late 90s. So the hope [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3405.6s)]
*  is we're finally going to have like really exciting things to [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3410.52s)]
*  invest in again. But but yeah, look, I think we're at the tail [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3412.8s)]
*  end of the last cycle and the beginning of a new cycle. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3417.0s)]
*  And vintage distortion is so real, you know, it's very hard [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3420.36s)]
*  to understand how each of these vintages with your late bloomers [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3424.04s)]
*  or overpriced things, companies getting $100 million around [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3427.48s)]
*  total at a billion dollar valuation before they have [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3431.84s)]
*  product market fit. And those distortions were just so [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3434.12s)]
*  pronounced the last five to 10 years that we're now sorting [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3438.28s)]
*  them out like a like a house of mirrors where you don't know [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3441.44s)]
*  who's tall, who's fat, who's skinny, what the reality is here. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3444.48s)]
*  And the other big thing is this peanut butter effect that you [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3447.44s)]
*  know, I tweeted about today, you know, during peak Zerp, you had [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3449.8s)]
*  all these exceptional team members, you know, the number [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3454.36s)]
*  2345 person at a company that was doing great, they would [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3457.6s)]
*  leave to start their own company. So the talent got [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3461.64s)]
*  spread, then you had so many of these founders rushing into the [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3463.8s)]
*  same vertical. So you'd have 20 startups, because there was too [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3467.4s)]
*  much capital pursuing the same opportunity, you pursue the same [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3470.64s)]
*  opportunity, what happens to earnings, they get spread, then [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3473.52s)]
*  what happens to customers, they get spread across 20 different [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3477.64s)]
*  products competing for the same customer. And then what happens [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3481.2s)]
*  with, you know, ownership stakes for us as GPS and LPs to moth, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3484.52s)]
*  the ownership stakes, because the valuations went up so much, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3489.24s)]
*  they got spread like peanut butter. Instead of a series A [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3492.2599999999998s)]
*  getting 20% of a company got you 10 instead of a C check getting [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3495.64s)]
*  you 5%, it got you one, there's no DPI possible, you nailed it [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3499.08s)]
*  and Sachs nailed it. But and the thing to remember is both of [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3503.32s)]
*  those two things now work together to erode the return [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3506.0800000000004s)]
*  stream for the general partner, but really, most importantly, for [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3509.32s)]
*  the limited partner. So I do think that we are in a situation [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3513.0800000000004s)]
*  where the average returns are going to decay by 50 to 100% [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3517.6400000000003s)]
*  because of what Sachs said, and because of what you said. On top [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3521.8s)]
*  of that, I don't think we know what the actual cap structure [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3525.32s)]
*  needs to be for a successful AI company. Is it 20 people that [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3529.52s)]
*  does the work of 2000 now because they have all of these agents [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3534.04s)]
*  and systems that work on their behalf. If that's true, giving [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3537.16s)]
*  that company hundreds of millions of dollars is actually [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3540.96s)]
*  the opposite of what you want to do, you want to give that [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3544.08s)]
*  company 10 or 15 and then let them cook. And so we have a we [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3546.24s)]
*  have a right sizing of capital problem that needs to happen. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3551.28s)]
*  The data would tell you though that the industry understands [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3554.2s)]
*  that. So the fact that we've gone from 50% of people being [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3557.04s)]
*  able to raise a fund to 12% means that a lot of people will [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3559.96s)]
*  get washed out of the industry, less capital being raised, which [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3563.88s)]
*  probably is foreshadowing the fact that these companies will [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3568.16s)]
*  need a lot less capital. But you know, that has a lot of [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3571.32s)]
*  implications as it ripples through our economy. It has, I [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3574.44s)]
*  think it's very good for the early stage. I think, you know, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3577.28s)]
*  you guys are very good there. You've talked about how it's [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3579.6s)]
*  good for you. It's very complicated, I think, for the [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3581.88s)]
*  expansion and growth stage capital. And then I think it's [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3584.52s)]
*  going to be there's going to be another turn on what happens on [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3587.56s)]
*  the IPO markets, because you can't have so many companies [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3591.08s)]
*  waiting with very, very few ways of accessing public market [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3595.2s)]
*  capital and exposure. I just think this is that is that is [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3601.6s)]
*  fundamentally broken. And we're going to have to reinvent we [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3604.64s)]
*  tried once with SPACs, we're going to have to go back to the [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3607.88s)]
*  drawing board and try again, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3610.24s)]
*  listings, secondary markets that are more fluid. I don't [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3611.52s)]
*  know what it is. But we need to do something because the status [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3614.72s)]
*  code doesn't work. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3616.92s)]
*  I think there's a lot so many good points that we're hitting [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3618.44s)]
*  here. I'll just say the the other thing to build on your [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3620.68s)]
*  point about hey, these take less capital, you have to look at [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3624.48s)]
*  what does your ownership after you've been diluted half by 50% [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3628.48s)]
*  as a seed or series of a investor, you're going to be [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3632.8s)]
*  down to half. So if you own 10%, you own five, if you own seven, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3634.96s)]
*  like YC, or we do in a company, you're going to own three, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3638.72s)]
*  you're going to really have to model out is the valuation you're [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3642.2s)]
*  looking at, what does it pencil out to for an outcome? And when I [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3645.2s)]
*  did this with our investments, I saw a leak in my game, which was [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3648.56s)]
*  hey, I'm putting 100k into a $25 million round or a $50 million [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3651.7999999999997s)]
*  round as a follow on investment, you know, to support the [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3655.3199999999997s)]
*  founder. Okay, what does that do for my LPs? Well, that 100k [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3658.72s)]
*  would need to hit some extraordinary outcome 510 2040 [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3662.48s)]
*  billion dollars in order for us to return the fund. So now my [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3667.8s)]
*  team understands, hey, take that 125k that 250k that 500k do more [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3671.0s)]
*  for do for more accelerator companies with it, because those [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3676.0s)]
*  could return the fund. And that's that fund bath, people [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3679.6800000000003s)]
*  stop doing I think all these fund managers who are getting [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3683.6000000000004s)]
*  wiped out, they never penciled out, what does this company I'm [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3686.2400000000002s)]
*  giving a million dollars need to hit in order for me to return my [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3690.32s)]
*  fund. And now they're finding out that [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3693.52s)]
*  that's not that's just tweeted. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3696.32s)]
*  You know, everybody's course correcting. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3699.96s)]
*  I mean, it's basically the capital deployments gone back to [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3702.04s)]
*  where it was in 2019. Let's call it. So again, we had this bubble, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3705.44s)]
*  the foam started building in 2020. But you had COVID people [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3709.76s)]
*  didn't know what to think. So there was some restraint, I [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3713.0s)]
*  guess. And then 2021, it just went wild. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3715.36s)]
*  That was nuts, man. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3719.32s)]
*  The question is, those little vintages are just going to be [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3721.16s)]
*  garbanzo beans 2120. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3723.12s)]
*  Well, you know, that's such an interesting point, you could [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3725.32s)]
*  return capital, you're gonna look like a euro. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3727.6800000000003s)]
*  Also, Chamath, I remember, I don't know if it was Michael [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3730.8s)]
*  Moritz, or Doug Leone, but I was talking to Sequoia about the [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3734.6000000000004s)]
*  time dispersion of your fund, like over what period time are [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3738.44s)]
*  you deploying a fund? And man, people started deploying funds [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3742.0s)]
*  in 18 months, because they can raise the next fund so quick. So [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3745.76s)]
*  like, screw it, I'm going to deploy this fund in 18 months, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3748.84s)]
*  24 months, and LPs were saying to me, like, what period are you [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3751.84s)]
*  going to deploy this? And I said, Well, you know, I was [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3755.8s)]
*  taught by Fred Wilson, and this person 36 months, 48 months [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3757.44s)]
*  would be a good window to deploy capital, because you know, it [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3760.7200000000003s)]
*  smooths it out. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3765.2400000000002s)]
*  I think you're saying the dirty little secret of the venture [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3766.2400000000002s)]
*  business, which is at some point, people get to a fork in [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3769.52s)]
*  the road. If they hyper optimized for returns, I'll put [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3771.76s)]
*  benchmark, I'll put Fred Wilson and usv, I'll put Sequoia's [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3776.32s)]
*  early stage fund, they have to introduce time diversity, they [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3779.84s)]
*  keep the funds small, and they look to hit grand slams. But [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3784.46s)]
*  there are many other people and I would say the most of the set [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3790.08s)]
*  outside of that, take the road more traveled, which is then you [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3793.6800000000003s)]
*  optimize for size, which then becomes a fee game. And so you [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3798.88s)]
*  optimize for velocity, get the funds out as quick as possible, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3802.2400000000002s)]
*  raise a new fund, they have no intention of generating returns, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3805.32s)]
*  because they have no ability to when you have absolutely no time [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3808.64s)]
*  diversity in this business in a pool of capital, you're giving [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3811.7999999999997s)]
*  away one of your best edges, David just talked about it as a [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3814.96s)]
*  smart practitioner, he was able to nurture these companies that [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3817.6s)]
*  all of a sudden they start to win. If you've all of a sudden [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3820.64s)]
*  flushed all your money in fund one, then you go to fund two, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3823.3599999999997s)]
*  fund three, by the time something in fund one hits, what [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3826.12s)]
*  are you going to do, you're going to cross the funds, or [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3829.3599999999997s)]
*  you're going to justify taking money from the left hand to pay [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3832.24s)]
*  the right hand, or you're just going to let your ownership wane [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3834.6s)]
*  because you frittered all the money away. These are all the [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3837.56s)]
*  problems that most of these folks have encumbered themselves [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3840.84s)]
*  with. It's very difficult to get out of it's going to take a [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3843.92s)]
*  look in fairness to them. They probably you know, got good while [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3846.68s)]
*  the getting's good. So they'll make a ton of money in fees, but [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3850.32s)]
*  they will not be able to raise funds. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3853.2799999999997s)]
*  And those fees are not clawed back folks, for those of you [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3855.24s)]
*  playing along at home. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3857.56s)]
*  Just just by the way, I feel better about those late bloomers [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3858.32s)]
*  in my portfolio, because I know the marks are real. Because if [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3862.04s)]
*  they're getting marked up now, then it's very, very solid. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3864.76s)]
*  Compared to frankly, some of those marks that we got in the [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3868.4s)]
*  bubble year, like 2021, I call them tiger marks, whether it was [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3872.1600000000003s)]
*  tiger or not. This is less real, quite frankly, and a lot of [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3875.8s)]
*  those companies are retrenching and have issues. So a mark now [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3879.6400000000003s)]
*  it just means something different than a mark then. But [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3883.6000000000004s)]
*  look, I want to, you know, just so we're not like, totally [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3886.4s)]
*  beating up on VC, there was you remember that in this bubble [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3889.2000000000003s)]
*  period of September 2021, everybody thought that this [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3893.52s)]
*  party would just continue forever. And this is a good [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3898.64s)]
*  example from the Wall Street Journal, where I was talking [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3901.56s)]
*  about how university endowments were minting billions in golden [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3903.8s)]
*  era venture capital. So the bubble wasn't just in VC was in [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3906.56s)]
*  the public markets too, because we had syrup, right, like [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3910.96s)]
*  interest rates were zero, liquidity was just flowing. And [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3913.6s)]
*  so it was very easy for companies to get liquid, they [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3917.08s)]
*  IPO'd and then the valuations were stratospheric. So the [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3921.12s)]
*  distributions to LPs were massive in 2021. And then that [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3924.7599999999998s)]
*  led to, again, more funds be able to raise bigger funds, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3929.44s)]
*  everyone was just kind of paying it forward and thought the party [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3933.2s)]
*  would just keep going. So this is what happens in a bubble is [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3935.3599999999997s)]
*  everybody thinks that it's just gonna keep going like that. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3939.88s)]
*  Is why it's so important as a fund manager or an entrepreneur [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3943.08s)]
*  for you to get great advice from people who've been at this for a [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3947.4s)]
*  long time and focus on the process. You cannot control all [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3950.64s)]
*  these outcomes, you cannot control all these meta events, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3954.6s)]
*  what you can control is your relationship with your [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3957.3599999999997s)]
*  customers, building a team, making great bets, supporting [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3960.4s)]
*  late bloomers. That's the critical part of all this is the [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3965.4s)]
*  process and you can make your process better. And so with my [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3968.3199999999997s)]
*  team internally, I'm constantly talking to them about our [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3971.7599999999998s)]
*  selection of companies, how we help companies get pulled [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3975.04s)]
*  through and get downstream funding how we literally our big [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3978.28s)]
*  effort this year is how do we introduce our companies to the [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3982.0s)]
*  top VC firms. And we've been working on that as a internal [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3984.84s)]
*  project, right of just getting our great breakout companies to [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3989.6800000000003s)]
*  the best investors to increase our pull through. It is a [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3994.2000000000003s)]
*  process and you have to trust and focus on the process. Yeah. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=3998.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, ironically, just I mean, just to end on sort of a positive [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4002.92s)]
*  note, if these interest rate cuts are real, like if we just [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4007.48s)]
*  got 50, if we get another 50 this year, if inflation is really [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4011.16s)]
*  tamed, and it's never gonna go to zero, but if they go down [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4014.56s)]
*  substantially, and we have this new AI disruption, this new AI [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4019.12s)]
*  tailwind, we could be back in another golden era. It's not [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4024.04s)]
*  going to be a bubble, but it could be another golden era. So [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4028.16s)]
*  we'll see. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4031.28s)]
*  Start companies from your lips to God's ears. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4032.0s)]
*  Love you guys. I gotta go. Love you. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4034.64s)]
*  All right, Shamath had to go do work apparently starting this [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4036.7599999999998s)]
*  new concept sax where Shamath is actually going to work and at a [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4040.16s)]
*  company. We never got to talk about the debate because we were [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4044.0s)]
*  busy doing the summit and we took the week off from a new [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4048.2799999999997s)]
*  episode. People wanted to hear your take. What did you think of [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4050.48s)]
*  Kamala and Trump, the one and only debate we're going to hear [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4054.16s)]
*  apparently? Any thoughts? [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4057.96s)]
*  I think that Kamala Harris performed better than expected. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4061.56s)]
*  She did that, I think mostly through having canned answers to [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4066.84s)]
*  topics. And she was able to kind of memorize those answers and [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4072.24s)]
*  say them and she was never knocked out of her preparation. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4076.68s)]
*  She was well prepared. Yeah, I think she was well prepared. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4081.2s)]
*  However, we now know that these were canned answers because in [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4084.24s)]
*  subsequent press interviews, she gave us a lot of feedback on [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4086.72s)]
*  she gives the exact same thing. It's like a jukebox where you [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4090.2400000000002s)]
*  just push the button, the same answer. Exactly. So she's, she's [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4092.92s)]
*  memorized a certain number of talking points. And that's all [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4096.8s)]
*  she's going to give you, no matter what the question is. And [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4100.6s)]
*  if you saw that it's become a meme now where she saw that [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4103.4s)]
*  question when she was asked about inflation, there's a pause [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4107.12s)]
*  when she's figuring out which greatest hit she's going to play. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4109.72s)]
*  And then, you know, she, I guess pushes B 26 in her head and then [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4112.8s)]
*  it begins. So I was born in the middle class. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4117.04s)]
*  And it's working, apparently, right? It seems like it's it's [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4120.68s)]
*  helping her. Yeah. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4123.92s)]
*  I think what you saw is that she got a bounce out of the debate. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4125.32s)]
*  But now it's sort of like a lot of these bounces, there's been [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4128.08s)]
*  kind of effervescence to it. And then it kind of settles down [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4132.92s)]
*  back to their occurring pattern. And so I think the election is [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4135.76s)]
*  extremely close, but I don't think [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4140.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I mean, every day, it's like a poll going one way or [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4141.8s)]
*  the other. And this is the closest of our lifetime, maybe. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4145.04s)]
*  Or that I can remember. I mean, it's nuts how this thing has [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4148.48s)]
*  flipped over and over again. What did you think of Trump's [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4151.0s)]
*  performance? Were you disappointed? There were some [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4153.28s)]
*  rumors, people were a little upset that he doesn't prep as [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4156.04s)]
*  much as he should. What's your what's your advice there? You [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4159.36s)]
*  know? [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4162.44s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think that he was in a very difficult [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4162.88s)]
*  situation. You basically had a three on one situation where he [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4166.48s)]
*  was up against not just Kamala Harris, but the two debate [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4170.28s)]
*  moderators. It turns out that Lindsay Davis is Kamala's [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4172.68s)]
*  sorority sister. David Muir was fact checking him constantly. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4176.16s)]
*  And some of those fact checks weren't even correct. For [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4182.84s)]
*  example, we now know that the Springfield city manager has [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4185.8s)]
*  acknowledged complaints about pets being eaten. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4190.08s)]
*  Oh, here we go. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4192.84s)]
*  We're gonna get through the episode. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4194.6s)]
*  It's as far as far back as March, there are videos of him [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4195.72s)]
*  talking about the complaints. Now, you can you can say that [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4200.719999999999s)]
*  you don't believe those stories or whatever. But those reports [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4206.2s)]
*  were real. But David Muir fact checked in real time saying that [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4209.36s)]
*  Trump was wrong. And there was like this effort to kind of gas [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4214.48s)]
*  light and make him sound crazy during the debate, when there [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4218.599999999999s)]
*  are in fact sources for what he was saying, it might have [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4221.839999999999s)]
*  thrown him off a little bit. I noticed like it was like he I [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4224.04s)]
*  agree, they going into it. I think they need to negotiate in [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4226.88s)]
*  the future, you know how they're negotiating the microphones on [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4231.68s)]
*  or off audience on or off. I think they should negotiate. Are [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4235.68s)]
*  we fact checking in real time? Or are we not fact checking? And [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4239.24s)]
*  who's doing that? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4242.56s)]
*  Totally. And they only fact check one candidate. For example, [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4243.2s)]
*  when Kamala Harris repeated numerous hoaxes, like the very [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4245.72s)]
*  fine people hoax, the bloodbath hoax, the suckers and losers [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4248.84s)]
*  hoax. I mean, these are things that were already addressed in [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4253.400000000001s)]
*  the last debate. And, you know, even left wing sites like [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4256.52s)]
*  Snopes have said the whole very fine people think is [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4259.56s)]
*  Yes, for people who don't know that they there's been selective [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4262.6s)]
*  edits. And I mean, there's been selective edits forever. But [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4265.56s)]
*  that one is particularly egregious. It's really [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4267.76s)]
*  egregious. The bloodbath one is really egregious too, because [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4269.72s)]
*  what he was talking about the bloodbath, the auto industry, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4272.040000000001s)]
*  yeah, just make it into a January 6 extension, which it's [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4274.68s)]
*  not. Right. So she was able to say these things and never got [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4278.92s)]
*  fact checked once, which meant she never got knocked out of [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4282.4800000000005s)]
*  preparation. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4285.08s)]
*  And let's also be honest, like Trump is hyperbolic. So if you [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4285.84s)]
*  are going to say, you know, oh, we're gonna fact check Trump, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4289.64s)]
*  like there's a lot of material there. And he just he's a [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4293.4s)]
*  hyperbolic guy. That's kind of his schtick, right? I mean, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4296.72s)]
*  but here's the thing is that in the wake of that debate, look, I [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4299.88s)]
*  think a lot of people scoring the debate on like, technical [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4302.92s)]
*  debaters points would award her the the win for that night. I [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4306.28s)]
*  don't clearly she won. Yeah, I don't deny that. However, what I [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4310.28s)]
*  think has been surprising is that in the wake of the debate, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4314.2s)]
*  you're seeing her support sort of return more to its previous [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4318.84s)]
*  level. And so what I'm saying is the effect of that's wearing [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4322.96s)]
*  off. And I think one of the reasons why that's wearing off [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4325.92s)]
*  is because Trump still has the killer issues in this election. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4328.76s)]
*  He's got the border, and he's got inflation and the economy. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4332.2s)]
*  And Harris may have done well again on debaters points, but [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4336.24s)]
*  what substantive answer did she give in that debate, except to [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4339.88s)]
*  say I'm not Joe Biden, which is, I guess, true. However, what [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4344.04s)]
*  you're basically saying is you won't defend your own [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4348.92s)]
*  administration's record. You are the incumbent, you're not the [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4350.92s)]
*  change candidate. And you're saying that people should vote [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4353.88s)]
*  for you because you're not Joe Biden. Well, what is it about [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4357.16s)]
*  Joe Biden's record? That what is it about Joe Biden's policies [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4359.64s)]
*  that you don't agree with? I mean, after all, you cast the [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4363.36s)]
*  tie breaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, you [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4366.24s)]
*  cast it for the 2 trillion American rescue plan that set [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4370.24s)]
*  off the inflation. So the debate moderators never asked [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4373.0s)]
*  Harris, well, what is it about you that is different than Joe [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4376.56s)]
*  Biden on a policy level, other than the fact that [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4379.84s)]
*  apparently she's pro gun, I thought that was like a great [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4382.32s)]
*  moment for her. Objectively, I think, you know, I've said this [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4384.32s)]
*  forever here on this show, putting our feelings aside about [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4388.64s)]
*  the candidates, I think whoever comes across as the most normal [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4391.88s)]
*  or the most moderate is going to win. And I think she's done a [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4395.4s)]
*  great job of like, per se, convincing those moderates that [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4399.12s)]
*  she's not crazy. And he is what are your thoughts on that? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4403.92s)]
*  Because people looked at this very podcast, and they've said [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4407.24s)]
*  to me, my god, that's the Trump I want to vote for that Trump [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4409.72s)]
*  2.0, the all in Trump. And then people are like, ah, he's going [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4412.72s)]
*  back to the insult comic Trump, but I don't want the chaos. What [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4416.28s)]
*  are your thoughts on moderates, specifically in the swing [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4419.5599999999995s)]
*  states and this sort of strategy? [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4423.0s)]
*  Talk about the song about the teamsters. So Biden, when he [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4425.5599999999995s)]
*  was still in the race was plus eight among the teamsters rank [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4428.68s)]
*  and file. And now that Harris is the the candidate, Trump is up [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4432.6s)]
*  something like plus 26 with the teamsters. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4437.84s)]
*  Why is that because she's isn't she pro union as well? He was [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4440.68s)]
*  Union Joe. So I mean, it was like in the name. I understand [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4444.08s)]
*  why they loved him. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4447.08s)]
*  There's something about her policies. And I think her. Look, [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4447.92s)]
*  I think within the Democratic Party, I think it's her [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4454.240000000001s)]
*  personality. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4455.92s)]
*  I think I think it's partly personality. But I also think [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4457.08s)]
*  it's it's policies and cultural issues. So within the Democratic [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4459.160000000001s)]
*  Party, there's always been two tracks. There's the beer track. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4462.240000000001s)]
*  And there's the wine track. And so you know, Bill Clinton was [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4465.76s)]
*  classic beer track guy, right? [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4469.320000000001s)]
*  Your summit with Obama, right? And I think Joe Biden was was [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4471.6s)]
*  beer track, then there's kind of the wine track, which is the [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4475.6s)]
*  more it's the part of the party that cares about these boutique [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4478.04s)]
*  cultural issues, starting with DEI and equity and trans and [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4481.48s)]
*  things like that. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4486.839999999999s)]
*  Limits liberals is what they used to be called. But I like [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4487.759999999999s)]
*  yours wine liberals or the woke wine. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4490.2s)]
*  Basically, the entire California Democratic Party is very wine [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4493.679999999999s)]
*  track. I mean, Gavin is very wine track. Kamala Harris is very [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4497.04s)]
*  much right. You can understand why a blue collar worker, it [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4499.96s)]
*  doesn't appeal to that they want more of that lunch pail [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4504.2s)]
*  traditional Democrat. But that Democratic Party doesn't really [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4506.919999999999s)]
*  exist anymore. I mean, the Democratic Party has evolved to [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4511.04s)]
*  be the party of the professional class, whereas the Republicans [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4513.6s)]
*  are more the party of the working class. And you're now [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4516.84s)]
*  starting to see it. I think Biden was the Democrats last [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4520.48s)]
*  vestige of this working class party. He really worked at being [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4523.5199999999995s)]
*  appealing to those voters, you know, the whole Scranton Joe [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4526.96s)]
*  image. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4529.36s)]
*  Yeah, Joe. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4530.16s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. Whereas Kamala, when you get her talking in an [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4531.72s)]
*  unguarded moment, and it's not a canned answer, she's going to [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4535.16s)]
*  talk about diversity, equity and inclusion. And that's not what [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4538.6s)]
*  your typical teamster wants to hear. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4542.240000000001s)]
*  Let me ask you a challenging question because when it's like [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4543.64s)]
*  when I asked you a challenge a bit, if Trump loses, what do you [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4545.8s)]
*  think will be the cause of the loss? If he loses, like [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4551.240000000001s)]
*  strategically, when we look back on the last six months, what do [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4556.04s)]
*  you think you would change? What would cause it? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4559.120000000001s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, the great asset that Kamala Harris has is [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4562.76s)]
*  not her likability. It's not her track record. It's not her [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4567.16s)]
*  policies. It's the fact that she's got the media behind her. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4571.44s)]
*  And if you look at like, for example, ABC News, 100% of the [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4575.28s)]
*  coverage by ABC News is positive, whereas something like [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4580.08s)]
*  93% of their coverage on Trump is negative. And you saw this [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4584.0s)]
*  that before Harris replaced Biden's the nominee, she had [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4588.599999999999s)]
*  very low favorability ratings. And then the media basically [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4592.32s)]
*  reinvented her as this transformative candidate. So [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4596.2s)]
*  look, when you've got the media willing to operate as de facto [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4598.8s)]
*  members of your campaign, that's tremendously powerful. If we [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4602.8s)]
*  had a fair media, this election wouldn't be close. So that is [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4606.44s)]
*  the advantage the Democrats had. Now look, should Trump have done [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4610.5599999999995s)]
*  the debate with ABC News? No, I think he should have chosen more [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4615.08s)]
*  fair moderators. I mean, to their credit, I think CNN played [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4618.24s)]
*  the Biden Trump debate pretty fair and down the middle. But ABC [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4621.96s)]
*  I mean, it was predictable that, like I said, I mean, one of the [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4626.24s)]
*  hosts was her sorority sister, their friends. So you know, I [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4629.8s)]
*  think that if Trump loses, you could say that his willingness [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4634.0s)]
*  to walk into the lion's den, take on all comers do every [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4638.32s)]
*  interview, you could say maybe that wasn't a strategic, that's [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4641.08s)]
*  what she did. But at the end of the day, I think that voters will [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4644.04s)]
*  appreciate that both Trump and JD are willing to do basically [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4647.44s)]
*  every podcast, every interview, they're not afraid to answer [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4651.88s)]
*  questions. And when they do answer questions, you can see [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4654.64s)]
*  them thinking, and they don't give you the same canned answer [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4658.12s)]
*  they've given 10 times before, including at the debate. So yeah, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4660.68s)]
*  I mean, that's my take. What's yours, J. Kelly? [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4665.240000000001s)]
*  On which aspect? Be more specific. Give me a give me a [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4667.72s)]
*  specific [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4670.08s)]
*  what do you think? What do you if if if she ends up winning? [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4670.72s)]
*  What do you think the reason will be? [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4674.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good that's a good question. If she ends up [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4677.12s)]
*  winning, I think it will be that people believe that they I think [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4679.28s)]
*  it will be that moderates in those swing states and women [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4686.5199999999995s)]
*  believe that it's too much chaos and that Trump will be too much. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4691.16s)]
*  They want a calmer same thing reason Biden won, right, like [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4696.04s)]
*  that there's this like concept that the adults are in the room [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4699.8s)]
*  and it will be calm and it won't be chaotic. And I think people [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4702.36s)]
*  just still see Trump as a bit chaotic. And I think that's the [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4705.36s)]
*  big fear. And I think they've played the abortion card, and [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4709.24s)]
*  the right to choose really well, even though Trump said here, I'm [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4713.28s)]
*  not going to sign the abortion ban on pro IVF. I think they [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4715.88s)]
*  have that really great win of saying, Hey, you bragged about [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4719.0s)]
*  overturning Roe v. Wade probably wasn't smart to brag about that. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4722.5199999999995s)]
*  And they have that clip that they can keep reinforcing. So if [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4726.24s)]
*  he does lose, and I don't know that he's going to lose, I think [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4728.679999999999s)]
*  there's a lot of people who are going to go in there and vote for [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4731.96s)]
*  him. But not say it to pollsters and not say it to their family [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4737.32s)]
*  and friends because they're embarrassed because of the [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4742.2s)]
*  pressure against orange Hitler, you know, this whole rhetoric [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4745.24s)]
*  that he's going to, you know, overturn democracy. So I think [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4748.36s)]
*  it's a pretty good chance that he's gonna win. Actually, I [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4755.08s)]
*  don't think that this I mean, look, I think in a close race, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4758.2s)]
*  right, and say the statistics in a close race favor him. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4761.2s)]
*  Yeah, look, I mean, maybe we're asking the wrong question here, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4764.88s)]
*  which is why would he lose? I mean, I think maybe the real [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4767.44s)]
*  question is, why is he favored to win? Because I think the [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4769.16s)]
*  polls including it still still show him favor to win. And I [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4771.28s)]
*  think that when you look at what the big issues are in this [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4774.44s)]
*  campaign, and what has people agitated and upset, why they [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4778.0s)]
*  think the country is on the wrong track, something like 65% [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4782.2s)]
*  it has to do with the economy has to do with inflation has to [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4785.0s)]
*  with the border. I think that on the cultural issues that trans [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4787.4s)]
*  stuff drives parents crazy, they don't want the government telling [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4790.96s)]
*  them what to do with their kids. So it's hard to think of a [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4793.28s)]
*  killer issue, other than maybe abortion, that Harris has on her [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4796.84s)]
*  side, it feels like all the issues cut Trump's way. But [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4801.24s)]
*  that again, the thing that Trump doesn't have, and there's no way [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4804.759999999999s)]
*  to for him to fix this is the media is just so in the tank for [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4807.24s)]
*  for Harris. Now you raise a good point. Look, could Trump be more [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4812.44s)]
*  disciplined? Yeah, absolutely. However, you know, I think that [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4816.04s)]
*  what amplifies that is the fact that the media is quick to jump [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4820.48s)]
*  on every little thing he says and distorts it. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4824.5599999999995s)]
*  And he sets himself up for it, you know, like, part of what [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4826.639999999999s)]
*  makes him activate the base is that erratic behavior, his [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4829.28s)]
*  shtick, you know, the comedy, and then I do believe that it [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4834.16s)]
*  gets weaponized by the press, because it's like such so easy [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4837.4s)]
*  for them. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4840.5599999999995s)]
*  I agree with you that Trump could be more disciplined. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4841.04s)]
*  However, I don't think it's as bad as what you're saying, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4843.2s)]
*  because if it were, there'd be no need to make up these obvious [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4846.5199999999995s)]
*  hoaxes. There'd be no need to, you know, lie about the very [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4848.84s)]
*  fine people or or what he said about bloodbath. So if he was [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4852.4400000000005s)]
*  really saying that many outrageous things, why would you [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4856.56s)]
*  need to keep inventing things that he didn't say? And if you [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4859.12s)]
*  actually just stacking them? Yeah, the answer to that question [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4862.72s)]
*  is just throw everything you got at him. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4865.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. Everything at him. But look at look at [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4866.56s)]
*  Kamala's interviews. I mean, she hasn't given very many. But I [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4868.92s)]
*  mean, her answers are just I mean, just watch them. I'm not [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4872.4800000000005s)]
*  going to characterize them. But just just watch her actually [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4874.92s)]
*  Kelly said it. I mean, Megyn Kelly thinks she's stupid and [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4877.88s)]
*  not bright. I mean, she's not the most dynamic speaker, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4880.36s)]
*  that's for sure. And she doesn't seem to be able to have a [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4884.400000000001s)]
*  dynamic debate with intelligent people who are experts in their [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4890.4400000000005s)]
*  field, let's say, you know, she can't hold her own in the way [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4895.16s)]
*  you can see JD can write and Trump can. So here we go. And [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4898.36s)]
*  just on the on the second assassination attempt, I don't [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4903.400000000001s)]
*  know if you even want to go there. But I mean, gosh, I'm so [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4906.6s)]
*  glad that he [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4909.6s)]
*  Yes, it's your [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4911.68s)]
*  get shot at again, it's this is scary stuff, folks. This [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4912.52s)]
*  rhetoric's got to come down. I keep saying it. Nobody wants to [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4915.320000000001s)]
*  listen to me. But man, be [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4919.280000000001s)]
*  well, let's look at the rhetoric that Ryan Ruth was literally [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4921.76s)]
*  quoting on his Twitter was saying that Trump is basically [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4925.160000000001s)]
*  an existential threat to democracy. He was quoting what [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4928.8s)]
*  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and the mainstream media have been [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4932.52s)]
*  saying chapter and verse. So I think that, you know, if you want [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4935.4s)]
*  to ascribe motivation there, where did Ruth get these ideas, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4939.12s)]
*  they've been endlessly amplified by the mainstream media. And it's [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4945.96s)]
*  not like a one off comment. It's been the central narrative for [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4948.48s)]
*  the last several years is that somehow, Trump represents this [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4951.639999999999s)]
*  existential threat to democracy. And one way or another, that [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4954.639999999999s)]
*  threat must be eliminated. And I think Ryan Ruth simply took [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4958.12s)]
*  literally what the mainstream media has been saying, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4961.44s)]
*  1% of your followers is what I tell everybody high profile [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4964.5599999999995s)]
*  people you and I both know, his 1% of people in your following, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4967.88s)]
*  and we all have large followings here. And there's certainly [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4972.92s)]
*  people who have extremely large followings, 1% are mentally [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4976.48s)]
*  ill. Like when I say mentally ill, I mean, severely mentally [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4979.759999999999s)]
*  ill. And if it's but 1% of your following, if it's point 1%, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4982.28s)]
*  this could be 1000s of people. And this is what happened to [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4986.5599999999995s)]
*  John Lennon and other famous people who've been killed [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4989.32s)]
*  tragically, is those mentally ill people interpret things in a [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4992.6s)]
*  very different way. And when you say, you know, a phrase that has [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUA9QgqkxM&t=4996.52s)]
