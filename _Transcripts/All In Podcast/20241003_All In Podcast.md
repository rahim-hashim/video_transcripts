# In conversation with Mark Cuban
**All In Podcast:** [October 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM)
*  All right, everybody, welcome to the number one podcast in the world. Here we are on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=0.0s)]
*  all in podcast, we have a fifth bestie with us today. Joining David Freber, Chamath Pai [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4.64s)]
*  Hopatia, David Sachs and myself is the one and the only Mark Cuban. How you doing, buddy? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=10.64s)]
*  What's up, guys? I'm doing great. Thanks for having me on. Of course, of course. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=15.44s)]
*  Thank you. I've been practicing my virtue signaling, so I'm ready. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  I think we're gonna have twice the virtue signaling as normal. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=25.28s)]
*  Double the virtue signal. I'll say you to anybody. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=27.84s)]
*  You have gotten very vocal about politics during this cycle. And you seem to be I don't know if [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=33.68s)]
*  it's official, you know, speaking on behalf of the Kamala ticket. So why? Why are you this active? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=58.08s)]
*  What What is the reason that you've decided to get this active during this election? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=65.44s)]
*  Because I'm proud to be an American. That's exactly why I mean, you know, we all make choices and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=70.4s)]
*  think what's best for the country and show our patriotism in different ways. And, you know, I'm [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=78.24s)]
*  not a democrat. I'm not a Republican. I'm an independent through and through. Oh, my god, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=82.16s)]
*  like J. Cal. He's an independent too. Do we go? And that all the Democrats are afraid to call [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=86.0s)]
*  themselves Democrats. Well, look, I've said this many, many times. If it wasn't Donald Trump running, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=92.32s)]
*  it was a non MAGA candidate, particularly if it was Joe Biden still, I vote Republican. I've voted [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=97.76s)]
*  Republican before. If it was a non MAGA candidate versus Kamala Harris, it would be, you know, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=102.56s)]
*  let's look at the policies. Let's look at the character of the people involved. And let's make [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=107.92s)]
*  a decision. It's just Donald Trump is not a Republican. Republicans are Donald Trump. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=111.2s)]
*  You know, the Republican Party is now the family business for Donald Trump. And to me, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  I just think Kamala Harris is a better choice for the country. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=121.36s)]
*  On a percentage basis, how often have you voted just a level set Democrat versus Republican, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=125.12s)]
*  would you say out of 10 elections? Presidential, probably. I voted for George W twice. Then I [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=129.68s)]
*  voted for Obama twice. And then I voted for Clinton and Biden. But before that, I voted for [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=135.44s)]
*  Ross Perot Jr. My first vote was for a guy named something, John Anderson. So I mean, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=143.84s)]
*  I literally worked on Ross Perot Jr.'s campaign way back when. Tell us about that. That's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=150.88s)]
*  fascinating. He got 19% of the vote as an independent candidate. Yeah, I was living out [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=155.76s)]
*  in LA and this was 92. And this is when computers were relatively new. I sold my company and I was [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=161.12s)]
*  taking acting classes and just living by Manhattan Beach and just loving life. And, you know, being [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=166.96s)]
*  from Texas, I knew people there and they were like, look, we need somebody who understands PCs [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=172.4s)]
*  and computers and software. Can you help us? And I was like, definitely. I mean, I wasn't to the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=176.56s)]
*  point where I was involved in his decisions, but I actually hadn't met him. My first company was [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=181.68s)]
*  a company called Micro Solutions where we did systems integrations, local and wide area network. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=187.92s)]
*  I wrote software for single multi-user app, wide area network apps. And we literally helped Perot [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=192.16s)]
*  systems get into local and wide area networking. And so, you know, one of my favorite stories from [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=198.48s)]
*  back then is, you know, I'm terrified. I'm a 26 year old kid. I'm in Dallas. I'm going into [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  Perot systems. I get to meet Ross Perot Sr., the man, right? And I'm walking through and he's got [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  the original, the model for the, no, he had the original Magna Carta, one of like the 13 [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=214.72s)]
*  Magna Cartas, and he had the original model for the Iwo Jima statue, right? With the flag up and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=220.4s)]
*  everything. And I'm just terrified. I'm going to trip and just wipe out American history. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=227.36s)]
*  And I walk up to him and I said, hi, Mr. Cuban, I'm Ross Perot. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=231.6s)]
*  I mean, it reversed that. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=236.8s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I was so nervous. And he like, made fun of it. And, you know, got to be friends [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  and did a lot of business, helped those guys a lot. I made them a lot of money. They made me a lot [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=247.28s)]
*  of money. Did you have any more interactions with them when you were on the campaign? Did you get a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=250.96s)]
*  sense of- No, did not. No, I was just a little plebe, just trying to do little plebe stuff in LA. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=254.8s)]
*  I didn't know that you took acting classes. That's interesting. Did you want to be an actor or [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=260.24s)]
*  before a businessman or what? No, no, no. This was after I sold Micro Solutions. I bought a [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=263.68s)]
*  lifetime pass on American Airlines, moved to LA, got a place right on Manhattan Beach, right on the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=267.92s)]
*  beach, get two flight attendants as roommates. And I was just loving life. And I was like, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=273.04s)]
*  how else can I meet women? I'm going to take acting classes. And it was like one of the best things [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=278.24s)]
*  I've, one of the best things I've ever done, because, you know, being a business guy, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=283.76s)]
*  it's always right brain, right brain, right brain. And acting is like, don't think, just be, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=287.6s)]
*  don't think, just be, just let it go. So it was a totally different experience. And that's why you [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=292.0s)]
*  see me do all these cameos and stuff. Because I like to do it because it's the one place where [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=296.08s)]
*  you just have to completely let go and it's a completely different approach to life. So, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=300.56s)]
*  you know, little backstory. Yeah, you got a good character arc on Entourage. I think that was [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=305.36s)]
*  probably the best one. Seven episodes plus the movie. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was pretty [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=310.0s)]
*  memorable. So, Sax, lead us off here. I don't know if you've been following Mark Cuban on social [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=314.64s)]
*  media at all, or if you guys interact. I can't resist asking. So is your, is your acting as a [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=320.8s)]
*  surrogate for Kamala? Is that acting too? When they go live, when they go live, we go hi. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=327.44s)]
*  Obviously, I truly believe in it. And look, it's always relative. It's always relative to the other [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=337.6s)]
*  candidate. And so obviously, as you guys know, I'm not a big fan of Donald Trump. I gave him a shot [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=341.6s)]
*  eight years ago. Didn't work out. Can we get into this? Because you obviously have like a love hate [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=347.6s)]
*  relationship with Trump going back 20 something years. So let's just go through the timeline here. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=353.04s)]
*  I'm just very curious about this. First of all, I don't hate the guy at all. If he was running for [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=359.84000000000003s)]
*  president, and we all got together and you know, just shot the s*** like we are now, he's a blast. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=363.12s)]
*  He's fun to talk to. You know, he's got charisma. He's got personality. He's easy to like. I mean, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=368.72s)]
*  he's used to schmoozing. He's one of the world's best schmoozers. And so he's easy to get along [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=374.56s)]
*  with. It's not personal. But that doesn't mean like you guys s*** with each other. It doesn't [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=379.84s)]
*  mean you can't, you know, as different things happen over time, you can't go back and forth. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=384.4s)]
*  And you know, he did the same thing. So the whole history of it was back right when we went public [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=388.64s)]
*  at broadcast.com. No, right after we announced the sale in 2000. Mr. 2000? Yeah, after we announced [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=396.32s)]
*  the sale and January 2000, he threw a Super Bowl party at Mar-a-Lago. And one of my buddies [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=403.6s)]
*  who knew him invited me. And I was like, cool, I'll go. Mar-a-Lago hadn't seen it. Donald Trump, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=411.6s)]
*  maybe I'll meet him. And so, you know, you guys have seen Mar-a-Lago and a beautiful pool, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=418.48s)]
*  beautiful view. There's a verandah up there. Like a bunch of hooters and what's the suntan lotion [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  that always had girls, whatever. Tropicana? Tropicana? No. But you- Suntropic. Suntropic. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=431.68s)]
*  Suntropic. One of those, right? And so they were all dressed in orange and they were walking around [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=438.24s)]
*  and it was just like a big deal. And it was funny as hell. And so not that that's a bad thing. It [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  was actually kind of entertaining. And so he comes up to me and I'm with the VP of Visa, my buddy [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=447.2s)]
*  and Jerry Yang, I think it was. Maybe it wasn't Jerry, but- Co-founder of Yahoo. Yeah, co-founder [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=455.2s)]
*  of Yahoo. And he was like, hey guys, nice to meet you. And I'm like, hey, I'm Mark, Donald, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=460.72s)]
*  da-da-da. And he just, you know, not to be mean, just in a flipping way, he was like, hey, someday [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=466.72s)]
*  you'll be able to sit up there with the rich people pointing to the verandah and walked away. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=472.24s)]
*  And I'm like, okay, fine, you know, whatever. And so then not long after that, through my friend, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  he got back in touch with me. And, you know, this is the early days of the internet, early 2000s. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  And it's still, I guess, still 2000. And I get an invitation to go to his office in Trump Towers. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=489.76s)]
*  And I'm like, this is cool, of course. And, you know, he wants to talk to me about business. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=498.48s)]
*  And I'm like, you know what, Donald, I'll help you all I can. He's getting donaldtrump.com, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  and he wants to sell tchotchkes and merchandise. I guess some things never change. And so, you know, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=508.15999999999997s)]
*  so I'm in there trying to tell him about what you can and can't sell online and what works. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  And that was all fine and good. Medivanka, it was all really cool. But the one thing that left with [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=518.24s)]
*  me, if you've ever been or seen pictures of his office, every inch of his office is covered with [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=522.8s)]
*  pictures of him. Every single inch of the office. Like meeting celebrities, right? Stuff like that. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=528.48s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Or, you know, whatever covers he was on and just whatever, right. And I just remember [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=535.28s)]
*  walking through there and afterwards, you know, it was a nice meeting and we had some follow up [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=540.64s)]
*  calls and everything, but it never went anywhere in terms of the online stuff. But I just remember [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=545.12s)]
*  thinking to myself, if I ever become, you know, visible or famous, you know, to that level, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=549.04s)]
*  don't let me get so caught up in just having pictures of myself. And, you know, I'd had [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=554.96s)]
*  conversations with my buddies about it, just like, you know, you guys would. And so then in 2004, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=559.76s)]
*  I got a chance to do a show called The Benefactor. ABC called me and said, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=567.92s)]
*  okay, wait, let's show this. We have this. This was got tweeted. So, so, so. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=571.84s)]
*  This is after we got canceled. You did Oppo research, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=576.24s)]
*  Sax? You got Oppo research? This is all online. This is all on X. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=578.8000000000001s)]
*  When people try to **** with me on Twitter, they throw this up. So anyway, so when I got the gig, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=583.36s)]
*  he was like, congratulations, good luck and everything. I was like, thank you and whatever. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=589.36s)]
*  And then when I got canceled, he sent me that letter basically saying you suck. And so. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=593.84s)]
*  Well, he was, he was dancing on the grave of your show, but so you're saying you didn't have beef [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=598.48s)]
*  with him before that letter. No, yeah, it was not a beef, but it was just like, that's what it was. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=602.72s)]
*  And so it was just like, okay, whatever. And, um, okay. But then when he ran in 2016, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=608.72s)]
*  you were supportive. Can we show that? Let's show the 2016 clip. There's more in between. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=615.36s)]
*  There's a lot more in between. Okay. Okay. So that's 2004, 2007. Um, Eric reaches out to me and [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=619.44s)]
*  goes, Hey, there's no hard feelings with my dad or anything. And I'm like, no, I don't care. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=626.64s)]
*  He goes, we're working with, um, these Russian MMA fighters, this guy named Fedor Emelianko, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=630.08s)]
*  who was like one of the best ever at that point in time and Josh Barrett. And kind of the irony [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=635.52s)]
*  of all this is we were competing with Dana, Dana White and the UFC in some respects, because a lot [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=640.64s)]
*  of fighters felt like they weren't getting paid enough. There was no healthcare. There was no [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=646.24s)]
*  nothing. Right. And so I had a TV network. We had started the first all high definition TV network [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  called HD net back in 2000, back when TVs cost $20,000 and everybody thought we were idiots, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=655.84s)]
*  but slowly, but surely it was taking off. And so they came to me and said, we'd like to put, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=661.84s)]
*  we're partnering with these guys who are putting on this MMA fight, um, with Fedor and Josh Barrett [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=666.96s)]
*  and some other folks. And we'd like to broadcast it on, on HD net. Cause we had a show called, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=673.0400000000001s)]
*  this week in MMA. So we were promoting, we had fights that we were already putting on every [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=678.72s)]
*  Friday night. So it actually was a good fit. So you'll see pictures of me sitting with them [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=683.04s)]
*  and actually, and I couldn't find it. I was so pissed cause I was going to with him some more. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=687.5999999999999s)]
*  What he said in the end, what, you know, during the time we were sitting at that podium was [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=692.0799999999999s)]
*  everything Mark Cuban touches turns to gold. And so I was like, that would have been so great to [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=696.16s)]
*  have out there. And so, and anyway, so we're friends again. And so it's 2007 and we're friends and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=701.4399999999999s)]
*  nothing happens between then until whenever he started going crazy on Twitter and, um, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=707.12s)]
*  all the Obama stuff and everything and the birth certificate and the birth, birth and stuff. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=713.2s)]
*  So he's on Twitter and he started with me. I say that, so let me just preface this by saying [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=718.24s)]
*  I golfed once in my life in 1989 and I hated it so bad. I was throwing clubs. Cause I'm one [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=725.92s)]
*  of those really super competitive guys. I'm like, never again, but I went and worked, um, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=731.12s)]
*  I auctioned off myself to be a caddy at a golf tournament that he also was at, but he starts [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=736.08s)]
*  tweeting that I saw Mark Cuban and he swings like your girl and this and that his swing is like your [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=741.44s)]
*  girl. I like, nobody saw me swing cause I don't golf. And so I started back with him. And so we [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=746.24s)]
*  went back and forth on Twitter for years, for years. And then he comes down the, um, escalator [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=752.64s)]
*  in 2015 and I'm like, all right, this guy's got no chance to win. Um, but I think it's great because [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=758.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't like traditional politicians. I'm not, you know, there's nothing about me that thinks [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=765.04s)]
*  that the way we do politics or the way the government is run is a good thing. Not at all. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=769.92s)]
*  I mean, I, my heart is libertarian, but I realize you can't libertarians are not problem solvers or [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=775.12s)]
*  ideologues. You know, like you look at Rand Paul, everything's only one way. He doesn't try to solve [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=780.7199999999999s)]
*  problems. So anyways, um, I digress. So he comes down the, I'm like, that's cool, right? He doesn't [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=785.52s)]
*  have a chance to win, but I'm like, he's the best thing ever. You know, you know how, you know, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=790.4s)]
*  I forget where I was, but I was like, he's the best thing that ever happened to politics. He's [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=795.12s)]
*  not a politician. He's not going to be a step for candidate. I may not agree with his positions, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=798.9599999999999s)]
*  but you know, just the fact that he's not a politician is a good thing. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=803.92s)]
*  And so from there, he called me and we talked a lot, probably 10 to 15 times on the phone. He [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=807.92s)]
*  would call me, you know, and he tweeted one time Mark Cuban was trying to come. I never had a number. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=813.52s)]
*  There was no way for me to call him. Right. He would, you know, and you know, the way he emails, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=818.16s)]
*  he refuses to send an email because he doesn't want any proof of anything that he's done. Right. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=822.16s)]
*  And so, you know, he would write it up. Like you had one of those pictures. So bring up the one [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=827.12s)]
*  on the CNN where he says, what happened? So right there, CNN nasty, what happened? See, see what he [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=831.92s)]
*  does there. His email, he writes on a piece of paper and then someone scans it and sends it as [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=836.4s)]
*  an image via email. And so what happens to the audience can understand. So the email is from you [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=840.64s)]
*  to him saying, tell the boss, I said, congrats on his sweep. And then, and then his assistant printed [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=847.76s)]
*  it out and then wrote back to you. And like, this is one of many emails that we went back and forth [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=853.12s)]
*  on this door. But just to be just as a weird point, he literally prints out his emails, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=858.0s)]
*  writes on them, has them scanned in and sent as an image to you, Mark. Wow. So are you on CNN? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=864.56s)]
*  Nasty. What happened? How did he send this to you? He emailed this to you or what? He [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=870.72s)]
*  emailed it in image file. He doesn't use email. I mean, the guy, no, no, his assistant emailed it back [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=873.92s)]
*  right. So he writes on the piece, assistant prints it out. He reads it. He writes on it. She scans it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=878.7199999999999s)]
*  She scans it, sends the image to me. Now the big question there, you can't just let that slide. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=884.56s)]
*  Why do you think he does that? Is this a different generation? No. At least that's my interpretation. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=888.8s)]
*  No, absolutely not. Nope. I'm with Mark. He don't want paper trails. Cause he's doing so much shady stuff, man. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=893.4399999999999s)]
*  I think you're reaching there. Obviously there's a paper trail. If he writes on a piece of paper, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=900.48s)]
*  hold on. If I write right now on a Post-it note, scan an email to you, there's a paper trail. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=905.84s)]
*  No, no, you can't search for it. And it's not his, you know, yes. To your point, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=911.4399999999999s)]
*  he's just telling you, he won't send emails at all. He doesn't want to create an electronic record. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=916.56s)]
*  What's the difference? You have to ask him on that. But he's generational. This is my interpretation. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=922.3199999999999s)]
*  He has said it out loud, David. He has literally said it out loud that he doesn't want a paper trail. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=928.16s)]
*  But anyway, so let's go back. So, so now we're talking back and forth and we're having legit [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=931.8399999999999s)]
*  conversations. I remember asking him, you know, you realize as president, you're going to have [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=936.7199999999999s)]
*  to make decisions where people can die. And he really wouldn't respond. Yeah, I get it. I get it. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=940.56s)]
*  I'm like, Donald, you don't have a ground game. What are you going to do? How are you going to [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=945.68s)]
*  get through this and beat him? Yeah, I got the evangelicals doing all that. I'm not worried about [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=948.8s)]
*  it. I'm like, Donald, you know, and we would, I would bring up things about there was this one [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=952.4s)]
*  thing where the FBI used this device to break into an iPhone. And there was a big thing about, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=957.36s)]
*  you know, privacy. And I tried to engage him on a conversation on it. And it's just like, I don't [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=966.48s)]
*  know, you know, just didn't want to talk about that at all. And that would happen multiple times, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=972.88s)]
*  where I would try to engage in conversations about some, some type of policy. And they're just, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=977.9200000000001s)]
*  it never got anywhere. And there was never a conversation. And I said to him, I'm saying, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=983.84s)]
*  there's another email where I said, Donald, at some point, you have to learn these things. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=988.4s)]
*  You literally have to learn these things in order to be president. And he didn't respond to that. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=992.48s)]
*  And that's when I went on CNN and I said, basically, look, I liked guy, but he's not learning. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=996.72s)]
*  He doesn't make any effort to learn anything. And I think that can carries on till this day, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1002.24s)]
*  because you can't look at things he says and say, that's really an in-depth response. So that's a [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1006.4s)]
*  nuanced response. And so that's what I said on CNN. And that led to the image that you guys posted. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1011.1999999999999s)]
*  So that was the falling out. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1018.16s)]
*  That was the falling out. Yeah. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1019.84s)]
*  Or maybe. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1021.12s)]
*  But it wasn't a complete fallout. If you want me to continue. So it's not a complete falling out, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1022.88s)]
*  because after that, he gets elected. I sent him a congratulatory message. And I say congrats, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1026.8s)]
*  you know, if I can ever help, I'm happy to. And so when they were starting to look at replacing [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1033.76s)]
*  the ACA, I was starting to get into health care and being excited about health care. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1040.32s)]
*  And so they invited me to the White House and I spoke to Jared. I spoke to this woman named [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1045.6s)]
*  Brooke Rollins, I think her name is. And I spoke to a whole group of people. I went to CMS and I [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1049.52s)]
*  spoke to the head of the agency. I spoke to the head of CMS, all talking about this thing I created [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1055.36s)]
*  called the TEN plan, which is a means tested ability to support anyways. And so they brought [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1060.48s)]
*  me back in. And then when the pandemic hit, I sent him some ideas on, you know, backstopping [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1066.8s)]
*  bank accounts and credit card accounts. So everybody doesn't just default. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1073.44s)]
*  And he had Manushkin call me. And then when they had with the pandemic, he connected with Peter [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1077.04s)]
*  Navarro. And I worked with him and actually found a company here in actually outside of Fort Worth [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1081.92s)]
*  that I put together with them. And I helped that company increase their output. And Peter Navarro [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1087.76s)]
*  worked with them closely and we really made a dent in all the PPE issues. And he invited me to the [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1093.36s)]
*  White House. And then I went to the White House one time, went into the Oval Office and there's [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1099.36s)]
*  pictures of me talking. And again, I tried to explain the health care stuff. He just wasn't [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1103.04s)]
*  having any type of in-depth conversation. He wanted to tell me about how much money he saved [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1107.76s)]
*  from Boeing, how many billions and this and that. And then it was a short conversation. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1113.04s)]
*  And then I was leaving. He goes, look, are you still on that show? And he goes, I'm like, yeah, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1117.36s)]
*  Shark Tank. He goes, yeah, that's Baron's favorite show. And then as I'm leaving further, he goes, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1121.84s)]
*  wait a minute, I really like that suit. So, you know, and, you know, he's called me since, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1125.1999999999998s)]
*  not since he left the White House, but, you know, later in his tenure at the White House [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1131.36s)]
*  and invited me to dinner. I mean, and so it's not like we left as foes and it's not like I [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1136.3999999999999s)]
*  don't like him. I just don't think he's the best person to be president. I don't think he was a [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1141.84s)]
*  good person. Let's just stress that. What, how would you think about the four years that he was [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1145.92s)]
*  president? In hindsight, what would you say was done well? What would you say was done poorly? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1151.76s)]
*  Just those two things. I think the way he dealt with the, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1158.64s)]
*  Zeitgeist isn't the right word, just the vibe of the country was really, really, really bad. I think [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1165.1200000000001s)]
*  the hate that he conveyed, I think the fact that what he tweeted negatively, you know, so companies [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1172.24s)]
*  didn't know what was coming next. You know, he tweeted negatively about me. He tweeted negatively [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1178.08s)]
*  about other people. I thought that was a real bad thing. When the BLM protests happened and turned [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1183.44s)]
*  into riots, when they went into Minnesota, he was like, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1189.2s)]
*  Who the f**k says that as a president? And so we had more people die during riots during his term [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1195.92s)]
*  than Biden by a long shot. And I think he misrepresented where he stood in terms of being [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1202.24s)]
*  anti-war. If you go back to 2019 and look at the war in Yemen, there were hundreds, at least 100,000 [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1207.76s)]
*  people plus died. And there was a bipartisan resolution to say, we're not selling any more to [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1216.32s)]
*  the Saudis. We're not selling any more weapons to the Saudis. And a bipartisan resolution, including [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1222.24s)]
*  Mark Meadows and Rand Paul and others said, you know, passed it and it went to his desk. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1227.92s)]
*  And he said, we're still going to sell these munitions and these weapons to Saudi Arabia, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1233.28s)]
*  even though these people continue to die. So when we talk about it, you know, it's not all that much [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1240.32s)]
*  different than Ukraine in some respects, only Saudi Arabia got the Glengarry leads and Ukraine [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1244.72s)]
*  got our old stuff and we replaced it. And so when he comes out now and says, look, you know, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1250.56s)]
*  I'm against all wars. There were no wars that bulls**t, right? The mainstream media. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1257.28s)]
*  And I know. Okay. So there's two things there. So just, just on the 2020 riots, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1261.84s)]
*  I don't know how you blame Trump for the BLM riots of summer 2020. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1266.6399999999999s)]
*  Blame it for the riots. What I said was how he dealt with it. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1271.2s)]
*  I get, you don't like the mean tweets. I get, I totally get the, you know, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1273.92s)]
*  don't diminish it, David, don't diminish it. It's just mean tweets. People pay attention [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1277.04s)]
*  to what happens. And when you have people whose lives are, I think it's far worse to actually [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1281.12s)]
*  have riots going on in the streets. That's what needed to be controlled. How many people [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1285.92s)]
*  that hold on. He wanted to send in the national guard to Minnesota. It was actually Waltz who [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1289.8400000000001s)]
*  rejected the national guard. He had no problem. And there were plenty of ties between on, there [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1294.0s)]
*  were plenty of ties between democratic activists and the BLM organizers of those riots. Time [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1298.5600000000002s)]
*  magazine did one story on that. I'm not saying he's at fault that the riots happened. I just, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1304.8000000000002s)]
*  yeah, but I can't believe they're using the riots throughout the summer of 2020 as an argument [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1309.1200000000001s)]
*  against Trump when it was the left. No, I think what he's saying is the leadership that he shows [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1313.12s)]
*  is of low moral character. Did he do anything right? Mark? Well, I'm done with the wrong stuff. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1316.9599999999998s)]
*  Okay. But wait, there's more, right? Let's go back to the foreign policy for a second. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1323.36s)]
*  Trump is correct that he did not start any new wars during his presidency. You agree with that, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1328.7199999999998s)]
*  right? That no new war started or he didn't start any. He didn't start any. He was like the first [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1333.28s)]
*  president in 20 years not to start a new war. Well, he inherited some for sure. He inherited [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1341.6s)]
*  Syria and Afghanistan and he wanted to get out and the generals didn't let him. And there wasn't [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1346.24s)]
*  really a war that happened in Turkey. And then when we got shut down, he didn't know, there wasn't [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1350.48s)]
*  really a war. I'll agree with that. He did start a war. That's his argument is that he did not start any new wars. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1356.56s)]
*  Has Biden started, Eddie? Well, I would argue that Biden provoked the proxy war in Ukraine. Yes. I [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1361.36s)]
*  mean, you can disagree whether he provoked or not, but there's no question the US has been deeply [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1366.8799999999999s)]
*  involved in a war with Russia in Ukraine. And what I'm saying is the corollary that the analogy [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1370.88s)]
*  to that is what happened in Yemen and that we had a chance to get out of Yemen and reduce the deaths [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1377.0400000000002s)]
*  in Yemen, much like they're talking about getting us out of Ukraine now. And we had the opportunity [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1382.16s)]
*  to stop selling weapons, but he looked, the best I could tell, he looked at it as a sales opportunity [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1388.0s)]
*  to sell to MBS all these weapons and he thought that was a positive. So a lot of people died and [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1394.16s)]
*  we're still in there today. So he had a chance to get us out and he did not. So I'm not arguing [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1399.68s)]
*  that he's perfect and Biden's perfect and it's tit for tat. It just is what it is. I'm just saying, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1405.2s)]
*  making this statement of fact, you know, and that's it. Yeah. Okay. Well, look, we did support the [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1411.52s)]
*  Saudis in their war with Yemen. So wait, let me give you the one last thing and then we'll... [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1416.96s)]
*  Yeah, keep going. So then I'll go to some positives. So the next thing you can actually trace [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1420.96s)]
*  that Yemen war, I can't say you actually, I'm a little bit hyperbole, but I can trace that [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1426.96s)]
*  from that Yemen war to the start of inflation. And here's how I explained that. And so in Yemen, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1432.96s)]
*  he did a deal for his boy in Saudi Arabia and sent them all the weapons in 2019. Fast forward one [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1439.52s)]
*  year and you're in May, April, let's say of 2020. And you're looking at the price of gas, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1446.96s)]
*  the lowest it's ever been, the price of oil just collapsing. At one point, people were paying you [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1457.3600000000001s)]
*  to take their oil. And so there was an opportunity, he made a decision because there was a situation [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1462.48s)]
*  that came up. The oil companies came in and said, this price of oil being so low is killing us. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1468.64s)]
*  We're losing a lot of money. We anticipate losing more because with the pandemic now starting, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1476.0s)]
*  demand is dropping like a rock. And that was coming from the oil companies. And so what he did, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1481.44s)]
*  he said, okay, MBS owes me a favor over in Saudi Arabia. That's the connection. And Putin's my boy. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1488.8s)]
*  I'm going to go to them and ask them to reduce production. Now, what happens to the price of gas [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1496.56s)]
*  when the largest producers of oil and energy decrease their production? The price starts [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1504.16s)]
*  going up and up and up. And so you can track the increase in the price of gas and how that impacted [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1514.8000000000002s)]
*  the price of goods the entire time that the production from the 10% reduction until they [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1521.1200000000001s)]
*  increase it like 300,000 barrels a day for two years. What is your argument here? You're saying [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1528.64s)]
*  Trump caused the inflation? Yes. And I'm explaining to you, again, the mainstream media. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1534.32s)]
*  First of all, by the way, the war in Yemen started on March 26, 2015, according to the [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1539.28s)]
*  chat GPT, which is under Obama. So that started under Obama. That's fine. But he had a chance, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1543.84s)]
*  he was asked to end it by Congress. He was selling $660 billion, I don't know the number, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1548.8s)]
*  I can't remember exactly, in weapons to Saudi Arabia. And there was a regular- [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1556.8799999999999s)]
*  How did the fact that we had 9% inflation in 2022, so two years after Trump's office- [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1562.16s)]
*  I'm so glad you asked that, David. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1567.76s)]
*  How in the world is Trump responsible for that and not Biden Harris? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1568.8000000000002s)]
*  I'm so glad you asked that because the mainstream media never talks about this stuff. And so, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1571.52s)]
*  she had a little dig there. So Trump goes in and says, we're going to cut the production by 10%. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1576.8000000000002s)]
*  Demand is still relatively low. But in April, May, June, as people start venturing outside [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1584.0800000000002s)]
*  their house and to the end of 2020, the end of his term, there's an increase in demand. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1591.04s)]
*  But the increase in demand, the increase in production doesn't match the increase in demand. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1596.56s)]
*  They limited, as part of this deal that Trump put together between Russia and Saudi Arabia, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1601.92s)]
*  and that led to other people in OPEC Plus participating, they only increased the [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1608.6399999999999s)]
*  production of oil by 300,000 barrels a day, which didn't keep up with the amount of demand that was [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1616.3999999999999s)]
*  happening. That started increasing the price of gas. That price of gas continued to increase [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1623.36s)]
*  for the two years this program was in place. This program wasn't like, let's just cut it for 60 days [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1629.9199999999998s)]
*  and go back at it. It wasn't, let's just do this for 90 days. Let's just do this during the Trump [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1635.6799999999998s)]
*  administration. No, no, no, no, no. This deal went before they got, it took two years before [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1640.0s)]
*  they got back to pre-pandemic levels of production. And so listen to what Trump says about drill, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1645.44s)]
*  baby drill. Why does he say drill, baby drill will lead to lower costs? Because oil and energy costs [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1651.52s)]
*  are part of everything. And you know what matches up perfectly? What matches up perfectly is that [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1658.56s)]
*  9.1% in 2022 and the day that that agreement ended where MBS and Russia limited production, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1664.88s)]
*  that agreement ended it like this. If you did your little Venn diagram that like, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1675.44s)]
*  and increase production, decrease production, bam. And so that is the answer to your question. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1680.3200000000002s)]
*  So just to summarize what you, the argument that you don't like about him is you got to know him [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1686.0s)]
*  like many people do. You worked with him on projects and like Pence, Barr, Mateus, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1690.96s)]
*  Tillerson, Bill Barr, and Mike Cohen and the mooch Omarosa, you realized this person is out for [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1696.24s)]
*  themselves. They don't care about the people they work with. And you fell out of friendship with [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1704.24s)]
*  him or whatever. There's a long list of people who don't, who worked with him, who think he's an idiot [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1708.64s)]
*  and don't like him now. You're on that list. Yeah. I mean, I don't think he's an idiot. I'm not saying [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1713.28s)]
*  that's my position. I'm just summarizing it. Look, I don't think he's an idiot. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1717.76s)]
*  Not your position. No, I haven't worked with him. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1720.8s)]
*  He's one of the greatest salespeople ever. He's one of the greatest motivators in terms of crowd [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1723.52s)]
*  motivation ever. But he's Roy Cohen Jr. He's Roy Cohen Jr. That is who he is. If you read books [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1729.84s)]
*  about Roy Cohen, everything Roy Cohen says to do, tracing back to the McCarthy hearings in 54, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1737.68s)]
*  everything Roy Cohen says to do, that is exactly what Donald Trump does. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1743.52s)]
*  I just want to paint this thing. And then I'd like to hear the glass half full version to the extent [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1748.56s)]
*  you have one. But basically, I just want to understand. So my understanding was in 2020, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1753.44s)]
*  what happened was not that Saudi Arabia and Russia were cooperating to cut prices, but they got into [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1759.76s)]
*  a fight because it wasn't really Saudi, but it was OPEC, which includes us, ANTS, OPEC Plus, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1765.92s)]
*  versus Russia. And we initiated against them, which they counteracted a price war. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1773.44s)]
*  They initiated against. So Saudi Arabia initiated against Russia. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1781.44s)]
*  So what I'm trying to understand is there's a war in Yemen. We don't stop the armaments of Saudi. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1786.48s)]
*  And I guess what you're saying is that then triggered an OPEC. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1794.4s)]
*  No, no. What I'm saying is MBS owed Trump one. MBS owed Trump one. So MBS starts the price war [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1801.84s)]
*  with Russia one year later. And the oil companies come to Donald and say, look, we're getting [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1809.92s)]
*  destroyed. Demand is dropping. They've increased because of this price war between Saudi Arabia [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1816.8799999999999s)]
*  and Russia. Saudi Arabia decides to take it to Putin and increases their production significantly. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1822.72s)]
*  So in order to keep the revenues up, Russia's got to do the same thing. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1828.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, all the demand is dropping because of the pandemic. And so Donald gets asked by the [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1832.16s)]
*  insurance company, the oil companies to go to MBS and to Putin and say, we need to stop this price [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1840.32s)]
*  war. We need to reduce production. And to his credit, if you think that's a positive, to Trump's [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1848.24s)]
*  credit, he did it. And so by reducing production over a plan of two years, and you can go look at [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1854.48s)]
*  the production numbers, right. And when that's done, by doing that, that increased the price of [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1861.84s)]
*  gas, the price of oil, the price of energy. And that was bad for American consumers who [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1867.52s)]
*  utilize gas, who paid for gas for their cars, really bad form. But he decided to work with his [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1872.88s)]
*  oil company buddies and protect them. You can say that's a good decision or bad decision, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1879.6s)]
*  maybe a strategic, he really felt they could go out of business and he wasn't willing to [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1884.48s)]
*  give them money to help them. But the bottom line was that matches up exactly to that 9.1% [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1889.44s)]
*  that David Sachs mentions. It also matches up to, okay, does he fully support the oil companies over [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1898.56s)]
*  the price of gas? And will that influence what he will do as president again? So when he says, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1907.76s)]
*  I'll just get out of Ukraine, depends on who's making the money and where it is. When he says, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1914.08s)]
*  I'm going to get people to drill baby drill. Well, we already learned a lesson. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1920.0s)]
*  Hold on a second. This is very hard to fact check in real time because I've never heard this theory [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1927.84s)]
*  before. The point is that, you know, this is like totally novel. I don't even think I've heard you [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1931.68s)]
*  make this theory on X before. Okay. So here we go. So you're dropping a whole, hold on a second. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1943.92s)]
*  Freeberg hasn't been able to get involved. Let's have Freeberg basically cite this nonsense. I don't [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1949.2s)]
*  get to interrogate it a little bit. It's not nonsense, David. You can always. No, no, but I just wanted to include [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1954.8s)]
*  Freeberg in this discussion. Go chat, GPT, go Google it, go look it up, however you want. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1958.88s)]
*  Okay. What about the fact that Biden's first day in office, he cancels the Keystone pipeline [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1966.3200000000002s)]
*  and a bunch of leases. He makes it harder to drill in the United States. So he reduces the ability for [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1971.6000000000001s)]
*  domestic producers to produce. You don't think that that would have an impact? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1978.24s)]
*  Yeah, but it wasn't on the price. It wasn't on the price of gas because the price of gas [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1982.24s)]
*  is a global phenomenon, right? The price of oil rather is a global phenomenon. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1988.72s)]
*  We are the largest producer of energy in the world, but we're still only about 13%. I think it is. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1993.2800000000002s)]
*  Don't quote me on that, but that's a range. And so the other 87% has more of an impact. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=1998.8000000000002s)]
*  And even to that, there was still an unlimited amount of drilling available on public lands [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2004.16s)]
*  and leases available that weren't fully used. Now that said, I think Biden did make mistakes. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2010.0s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. So wait, wait. Okay, guys, hold on. Let's just finish one thing before the other. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2016.08s)]
*  I would just like an answer of what is the good and the bad of Donald Trump. And then what I was [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2020.48s)]
*  going to ask you is what was the good and the bad of Biden? I just want those four answers. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2024.8s)]
*  Guys, just give me one second. Can I just ask, make one comment? I've been here for like 40 minutes. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2030.08s)]
*  I want to respond to the inflation point, Mark. I just shared two images. First was the [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2038.0s)]
*  U.S. crude oil production chart. And more than half of this oil is exported. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2042.48s)]
*  So you can see the reduction in production, but the domestic oil production [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2047.04s)]
*  capacity remained high relative to our consumption. So U.S. consumption, if oil was the biggest driver, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2054.16s)]
*  it really would have affected the profits of the exporting companies, not necessarily the cost of [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2062.56s)]
*  energy domestically. I will, however, point out that the Federal balance sheet, the Federal [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2067.6s)]
*  Reserve's balance sheet swelled during COVID from $4 trillion to $8 trillion. And as we all know, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2072.88s)]
*  there was significant fiscal stimulus, meaning the Federal government bought a ton of shit. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2079.6s)]
*  David, I didn't say it was the only cause. I didn't say it was the exclusive cause. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2086.08s)]
*  Well, I would argue that flooding the world with dollars, which is what the Federal Reserve did, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2089.36s)]
*  because they bought up all the bonds as the Federal government started to issue money in [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2094.48s)]
*  lots of different ways, caused the supply of dollars to go up, which causes the cost of anything [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2098.08s)]
*  that's dollar denominated to grow up. And I think many economists would argue and make the case [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2103.04s)]
*  that the fiscal policy and the monetary policy of the Federal government and the Federal Reserve [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2107.6s)]
*  is largely to account, and I'm not going to use the word blame, but to account for the inflation [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2112.08s)]
*  we saw in the cost of everything from energy to production to labor, to assets and so on. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2117.04s)]
*  But they're not mutually exclusive. They're not mutually exclusive. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2123.6s)]
*  They're not, but there was also significant, as we can all acknowledge, massive, in a dynamical [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2126.0s)]
*  system, global supply chains are a dynamical system. Stuff is made in one place, moved to [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2131.7599999999998s)]
*  another place. When one thing breaks or it slows down, it all breaks. And we had a massive shortfall [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2136.56s)]
*  in the ability to move goods around the world. And that was the biggest driver of the inflationary [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2143.04s)]
*  effect that we saw in the cost of everything. I agree 100%. But even if you go back to the [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2147.7599999999998s)]
*  first two charts you put up, it matches up with exactly what I said. Production went down, demand [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2151.2s)]
*  went up. And the net result was that price of gas went up and price of gases and everything. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2156.3999999999996s)]
*  Is it the only cost? No, production went down in everything, not just energy, but everything. And [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2162.96s)]
*  not because of energy, but because of a lot of other reasons. And then we had a whiplash problem [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2168.72s)]
*  where we had over demand relative to the natural. And none of the production systems could keep up [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2174.24s)]
*  with demand because of the fiscal stimulus. I agree 100% with you. All I'm saying, you can [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2178.96s)]
*  try to trace it back to maybe it's 1% of the price. Maybe it's 3% of the price. Maybe whatever the [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2184.32s)]
*  percentage is, I'm not saying it's exclusive, but you can trace it back to the decision being made [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2190.7200000000003s)]
*  to support the energy companies and say, we are going to reduce production rather than just [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2195.84s)]
*  letting the market play out and saying, we'll let gas prices stay as low as they are based off [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2201.04s)]
*  supply and demand. Now, do I agree with you that supply chain disruption, transitory? Yes, of course. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2205.84s)]
*  And fiscal and monetary policy, like stimulating the world economy by pouring a ton of money out [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2212.8s)]
*  that's never happened in history, right? For sure, 100%. The question is, and proportionally- [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2218.7200000000003s)]
*  Do you think Larry Summers was wrong when in Q1, the first quarter of the Biden-Harris [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2223.6000000000004s)]
*  administration, Larry Summers warned that if you pass another two trillion of COVID stimulus, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2228.88s)]
*  like they were planning to do, that could set off inflation, that we were on the brink. He said that. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2235.36s)]
*  He did make that declaration against his own party, Mark, and he said, this is the wrong thing. As a [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2239.92s)]
*  Democrat, he said, this is the wrong thing to do. And they went forward with what they planned to do [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2245.36s)]
*  for various reasons. Some would argue political, some would argue that they thought it was the [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2249.92s)]
*  right thing to do. And the effect was precisely as Larry had predicted. Yeah. Kamala Harris cast the [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2252.96s)]
*  tie-breaking vote for that inflation explosion act, otherwise known as the American Res... [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2259.1200000000003s)]
*  Inflation explosion act. ...rescue plan. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2264.08s)]
*  So here's the actually- I agree with Friedberg 100%. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2268.08s)]
*  The cause of this massive 20% inflation we've had over Biden's four years- [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2272.4s)]
*  No, but that's the whole point. ...is a secret deal [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2277.04s)]
*  between Trump and MBS and Putin's in there somewhere. You can dismiss it all you want, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2278.88s)]
*  David. Just look at the data and look at the numbers and they match up. Now, to Friedberg's [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2284.0s)]
*  point, the Friedberg's point, is it the only thing that caused inflation? Of course not. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2288.7999999999997s)]
*  When you spend too much money, when you inflate the economy, when you have supply chain disruption, [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2292.88s)]
*  all those things contribute. But we're also not having the conversation to say, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2298.56s)]
*  okay, how much of the supply chain disruption contributed to inflation? Was it 3% of that [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2302.88s)]
*  20%? Was it 5%? Was it 7%? Was it 1%? We don't know. It's impossible. It's all- [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2308.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, the supply chain was constrained during COVID and it was healing. It was getting better. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2313.36s)]
*  And then they pumped all the stimulus and everyone got these- [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2318.96s)]
*  Just to level set with the pieces. Let me just level set with the pieces, David. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2322.24s)]
*  Guys, it's Mark has an opinion. Let's leave the opinion. I'm just really curious. I just want [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2325.68s)]
*  the high level report card on the last two presidents. What is the high level report card, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2328.72s)]
*  Mark? To put a cap on this, just for the audience, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2333.52s)]
*  here is our national debt over the two presidencies, the two terms. And as you can see, [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2335.8399999999997s)]
*  with the taking out the bump for COVID, it's pretty much they're both wild spenders. I think [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2341.92s)]
*  we can all agree. They both are spending too much money and we need to have more fiscal discipline. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2346.72s)]
*  We all agree on that. Now, to Chamath's point, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2350.88s)]
*  Steelman, anything you like about the Trump presidency? And then we'll go to Kamal. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2354.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, I think there was good elements of the tax cut. I think he went too far, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2358.1600000000003s)]
*  but I think they needed to come down from 35%. Whatever the corporate rate, 35%, I think, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2365.6800000000003s)]
*  was corporate. That was too expensive. It made it difficult for us to compete globally. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2371.52s)]
*  I thought bringing down cap gains, again, I forget exactly what they were, maybe 29%, I forget, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2376.0s)]
*  was also smart. But I think he went too far. But you can argue that there's no right answer on what [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2383.92s)]
*  that is going to be. It's a guess, right? You just put it out there and you hope what you plan and [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2389.28s)]
*  what you propose and what is implemented works. And you don't know until it does. So I didn't have [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2394.6400000000003s)]
*  a problem with him trying that. Yeah, 35 to 21, you got it exactly right. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2399.28s)]
*  You've acknowledged that Kamala's unrealized gains tax is a disaster. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2404.72s)]
*  Well, I'll acknowledge that it's not real and you're making it up, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2408.08s)]
*  that you've never heard her say that. I made it up? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2411.2s)]
*  Yeah, you made up her saying it. It was in the last Biden-Harris budget. It was in [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2413.6s)]
*  the Harris platform at the DNC. That was the Biden platform at the DNC. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2419.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, they put her name on it. You have never heard her talk about it. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2424.7999999999997s)]
*  They did a search of place on his name and put her name in there. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2427.04s)]
*  You're reaching, David. You're reaching. You've never heard her talk about it at all. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2430.8s)]
*  She's been very specific that cap gains goes to 28%. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2435.52s)]
*  What has Biden done well and what has he not done well? And then the follow-up question is, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2442.56s)]
*  if it were an open Democratic primary, would you have voted for Kamala Harris? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2447.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't know. But then again, if Donald Trump participated in the debates on the Republican [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2452.0s)]
*  primary and the Republican primary, would you have voted for Donald Trump? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2457.36s)]
*  You know, they follow back the federal. You're saying it's analogous. The Republicans [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2463.1200000000003s)]
*  had an open primary. No, but they did. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2466.96s)]
*  DeSantis competed. They did, but he didn't participate. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2469.04s)]
*  Nikki Haley competed. They had an open primary. Hold on a second. Trump was 50 points ahead. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2471.92s)]
*  Maybe he should have debated. I don't know. Maybe. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2477.84s)]
*  Of course he should. No, I mean, look, I would have been [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2480.2400000000002s)]
*  in favor of him debating, but he was 50 points ahead and everybody had a chance to run. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2481.84s)]
*  But they didn't really have a chance because they wanted to debate. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2486.8799999999997s)]
*  Hold on. Let me finish and then you can get your response. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2489.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2492.0s)]
*  The Democrats pretended that Joe Biden was just fine, that he was sharp as a tack, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2492.48s)]
*  that he was the best version of Joe Biden. And when the primary came and you had outsiders like [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2497.2799999999997s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy try to compete, not only did Biden not debate, they basically used lawfare to keep [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2505.2799999999997s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy off the ballot. They did not allow him a fair shot at the nomination, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2512.8s)]
*  which is why he had to leave the party and run as an independent. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2518.32s)]
*  Then we find out after the debate that actually Biden is not fine. He actually appears to be [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2521.52s)]
*  in significant cognitive decline. So somehow Nancy Pelosi gets him out of there. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2528.0800000000004s)]
*  And then Kamala Harris is anointed. She's never won a primary vote ever. In 2020, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2532.32s)]
*  she ran and dropped out before the first primary. And then this time around, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2539.76s)]
*  she never had to compete in the primary. And somehow she's anointed as the candidate. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2543.84s)]
*  The question is, I don't think, well, the question is, how can you liken this to what [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2547.5200000000004s)]
*  the Republicans did having an open and competitive primary? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2551.28s)]
*  So first of all, the Republicans did not have an open and competitive, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2554.4s)]
*  key word, competitive primary, because if one of the candidates refuses to participate [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2557.44s)]
*  because they have a lead, look what happened to Joe Biden. For all we know, Vivek, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2563.1200000000003s)]
*  would have destroyed Trump as much as Trump destroyed Joe Biden. Nikki Haley would have [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2568.08s)]
*  destroyed Trump as much as Donald Trump destroyed Joe Biden. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2573.6s)]
*  I don't think that- Well, I was supporting DeSantis at that time, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2579.04s)]
*  and it was definitely competitive. And I think DeSantis would have crushed him too, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2581.44s)]
*  right? They were allowed to compete. Their names were on the ballot. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2584.08s)]
*  I know. You're talking about a very- [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2587.52s)]
*  Sacks, do you think DeSantis, Nikki Haley, or Vivek would have beaten Trump in a debate? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2588.56s)]
*  No, I think when, if you look at- He would have beat them. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2595.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay. Well, hold on. I'm saying it's [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2597.2s)]
*  unclear. I don't think you can just say that they would have won. I mean, Trump- [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2599.2799999999997s)]
*  Thank you. So that means it's not a truly competitive- [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2602.0s)]
*  Hold on a second. When Trump was in a crowded Republican field and debated, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2604.4s)]
*  he crushed everybody. So I just don't know what would have happened. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2609.2s)]
*  That was 2016. That was 2016. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2611.6s)]
*  You're right. This is just debate. This is just debate, okay? What about the point [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2612.88s)]
*  that the Democrats kept other contenders off the ballot, they used lawfare, and moreover, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2617.36s)]
*  they lied about Biden's cognitive condition, and then they anointed Kamala Harris through a [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2623.68s)]
*  process that is opaque, and we still don't know what happened. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2628.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay. So here's my answer. First, going back to the Republican, it wasn't a competitive primary [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2631.44s)]
*  if the contender doesn't participate. And yes, he did well against 15 other candidates in 2016, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2636.08s)]
*  but I'd be willing to bet that he's also had cognitive decline. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2642.3199999999997s)]
*  Everything he says and does is reflective of that. If Joe Biden had said the same thing, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2646.16s)]
*  we would be having a lot of quite- we don't judge Donald Trump and his cognitive ability the way we [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2650.4s)]
*  did Joe Biden. Okay. So we'll put that behind. Now let's go to Joe Biden. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2657.2000000000003s)]
*  Do you think Democrats lied about Biden's condition? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2660.56s)]
*  Let's just put it down like that. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2662.7200000000003s)]
*  Let me tell you my personal experiences with Joe Biden. I didn't talk to him a lot twice [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2663.36s)]
*  during that period. And I can tell you from the first time I saw him, a year before the last time [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2668.48s)]
*  I saw him, which was probably in March or April, I forget, there was a decline. But the decline was [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2674.4s)]
*  in his sharpness, his quickness of response. If you sat down and you listened to him speak about [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2682.64s)]
*  something, which I did, he wasn't forceful. He looked like a walking corpse. He looked awful. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2688.08s)]
*  But in terms of content, it was there. And so I understand why they positioned him the way they [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2695.36s)]
*  did. It's just to sell it was impossible. So that's part one. So I don't think the decline [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2701.44s)]
*  is nearly what you're saying it is, but I do agree that- [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2707.76s)]
*  Why did they get rid of him? Why did they get rid of him? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2710.56s)]
*  Okay. So now we're moving forward, right? His ability to respond in real time, you slow down. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2712.16s)]
*  We all slow down, right? I'm 66 years old and I've slowed down versus where I was at 45. So you know [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2717.44s)]
*  at 81 and at 78, you were going to be slower. Joe Biden just was not as quick. That was a real [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2724.48s)]
*  problem. He got destroyed in the debate by Trump because of that. Not because he didn't know the [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2731.36s)]
*  materials and the content, but he just couldn't respond and think fast enough. So I think that's [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2736.32s)]
*  where the misunderstanding is. It's not that he had cognitive decline in the pure sense. It's that [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2740.7200000000003s)]
*  his ability to respond quickly was gone. And he looked like he had cognitive decline. So now [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2746.56s)]
*  let's go forward to the Democratic National Convention, and right before that, where they [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2752.96s)]
*  replaced it. I was curious about just the mechanics of the whole thing. So being the curious [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2758.0s)]
*  person I am, I went and pulled up the bylaws and the rules of the Democratic Party and the [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2765.68s)]
*  Democratic National Convention. And they reset those every four years prior to them pulling out. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2771.52s)]
*  And it's very, very clear that the only mission and the only task, and it's pretty much the same [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2777.76s)]
*  in the Republicans. I look at theirs too. The only mission is to win. You want to win the presidency, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2783.04s)]
*  you want to have control of Congress. That's all they care about. And they give themselves [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2787.92s)]
*  every bit of flexibility to do whatever they damn well please to put themselves in that position. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2793.52s)]
*  They are a private organization. Okay, so are they the party then of democracy as they claim to be, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2799.76s)]
*  or are they the party of winning at all costs? No, so now you're trying to play branding games, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2805.44s)]
*  right? No, I'm just saying that their rhetoric is at odds with what they actually did. Hold on a [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2810.16s)]
*  second. There were 14 million primary voters in the Democratic primary. That's the mainstream [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2815.44s)]
*  media discussion of this, right? They said there's 14 million voters. I say Trump didn't debate at [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2819.76s)]
*  all. There was zero debates with Donald Trump. Which one was more- There's an open primary though. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2824.8s)]
*  People got to vote for their candidate. Yeah, but it's not an open primary because it's [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2828.32s)]
*  Donald Trump's family business. He controlled what happened. What? Yeah, look- Listen, I mean, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2832.16s)]
*  I was, again, I was supporting someone different during the primary. And the reason why DeSantis [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2838.0s)]
*  lost is he didn't get enough votes. Okay. The Republican primary voters wanted Donald Trump. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2842.24s)]
*  That's why Trump won the primary fair and square. Whether he debated or not, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2847.2799999999997s)]
*  he was up 50 points on everybody else. And I bet- And I don't know- [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2850.8799999999997s)]
*  That is not what happened with Biden. What happened with Biden is- Well, it's not- [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2854.24s)]
*  Biden- Let me finish, David. Let me finish. Biden won the Democratic primary. He got 14 million votes. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2856.64s)]
*  And then they threw out that result and put in Kamala Harris because they didn't like his- [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2861.04s)]
*  Were you ever in a fraternity? What's that? Were you ever in a fraternity? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2865.2799999999997s)]
*  Were you ever in a fraternity? No. Okay. In a fraternity, they get to vote on all kinds of [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2868.96s)]
*  s***. But at the end of the day, if the national organization says no, right, it doesn't matter [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2873.28s)]
*  who won the election. Right. So you're saying the Democratic party is a clique. I get it. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2881.2s)]
*  It's just not the party of democracy. Let me regain control here. Just to recap, boys- [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2884.64s)]
*  David, you're just talking branding. You can brand it however you want. I don't care how you [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2889.84s)]
*  brand it. No, the Democrats said they were the party of democracy. The Democrats said- [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2893.2s)]
*  I'm not a Democrat. I don't care what they do. I don't care what the Republicans- [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2895.68s)]
*  But you're supporting them. You're supporting them. So- [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2898.3999999999996s)]
*  No, I'm supporting Kamala Harris. Okay. So can you acknowledge- Hold on. Can you [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2900.08s)]
*  just acknowledge that their rhetoric is hypocritical? I don't care what the rhetoric is. I don't pay [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2902.7999999999997s)]
*  attention. I don't pay attention to their rhetoric. We're not going to get progress. I really want to [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2907.44s)]
*  hear what Mark thinks. Yes. Okay. Here we go. Move forward. Move forward. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2912.96s)]
*  Two- Okay. Two things seem to be true at the same time, if I'm recapping your position here. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2915.68s)]
*  Mark, one, you would have liked to see Trump debate. Two, I think you would have loved to [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2920.88s)]
*  see a speed run primary, perhaps. Maybe Kamala battled it out. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2925.28s)]
*  I honestly didn't care. Once Donald Trump was the candidate, I wanted the best person to beat [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2929.92s)]
*  Donald Trump. That's what I cared about. Okay. Let me go back to my question. So I'm just going [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2935.6800000000003s)]
*  to give you a succinct summary of Mark Cuban's position. His evaluation of the Trump presidency, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2939.6800000000003s)]
*  the positives were tax cuts- And warp speed and operation warp speed. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2945.04s)]
*  The negatives were continuing the war in Yemen when they had a chance to. And then this- [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2950.0s)]
*  Actually, the negative wasn't so much that. Sorry, Tramont. The negative wasn't so much [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2957.2s)]
*  he continued it. The negative is the hypocrisy in his approach. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2961.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay. Right. In the style. Okay. Now, can we just do a ball of how he governed? [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2964.08s)]
*  Can we do Biden? What are the things that Biden and Harris did well that have helped the country? [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2968.0s)]
*  And what are the things that they could have done better, did not do well? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2972.64s)]
*  So I'll start with the negatives first. So just so you know, that there's a lot of them. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2976.0s)]
*  One, the way they handled the border was horrific. There's no way to say it any differently. Now, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2979.68s)]
*  I understand why they took the approach they did. Literally, if I were in a Central American [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2986.48s)]
*  country and my family was at risk of getting shotgun because there's a drug war, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2994.4s)]
*  I'm doing everything I can. And I recognize that if I just set foot on American soil, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=2999.12s)]
*  I have a chance for asylum. And I get that. And I get why Biden and his administration might say, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3005.44s)]
*  just for humanitarian reasons, we're going to increase the number of people that we allow [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3011.04s)]
*  to do that. I understand why he would do it. But at the same time, he opened the door too wide. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3016.0s)]
*  And he made it so that there were too many people that came through. And that created [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3022.4s)]
*  cascading problems. Now, to his credit, back in June, I think it was, he signed an executive order, [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3026.16s)]
*  which he now has made permanent or as permanent as you can as president, that changed that there's [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3032.8s)]
*  no longer the option to just set foot on American soil and be eligible for a hearing for asylum. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3038.48s)]
*  You can't do that any longer. And to her credit, she worked with the head of the Mexican government, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3045.76s)]
*  and they have taken steps to reduce the flow of people to the border. And so now the number of [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3052.5600000000004s)]
*  encounters at the border is about the same as what it was right before the pandemic under the [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3059.12s)]
*  Trump administration. So while he was too long to do it, while he handled it incorrectly overall, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3065.3599999999997s)]
*  and the messaging was horrible, I think they got to the right place. But now we have a problem [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3072.24s)]
*  that he created where we have too many non-citizens, illegal aliens, however you want to [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3077.6s)]
*  call them, however you want to brand them. And we have to understand how to deal with them. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3084.72s)]
*  I think that they have talked about, Kamala has talked about first, and even JD Vance said this, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3089.68s)]
*  first we're going to get rid of the criminals, which makes sense. But Donald Trump says, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3095.12s)]
*  we're just going to deport everybody. Any illegal, we're just going to deport them. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3099.8399999999997s)]
*  Now, Obama was the deporter in chief. He deported more people than Trump or Biden, over 3 million [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3104.3999999999996s)]
*  people. But he had a specific process in place that everybody could understand. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3109.44s)]
*  And I think with Trump, remember that Orion Gonzalez kid, the six-year-old kid in Miami? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3113.84s)]
*  Elion Gonzalez. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3120.7200000000003s)]
*  Elion Gonzalez, right? Where all of a sudden you had these cops with riot gear on and machine, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3121.1200000000003s)]
*  and AR-15s or whatever they used, pointing them at a six-year-old kid cowering in a closet. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3128.48s)]
*  If Donald Trump does that, and that's not contrary to how he approaches things, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3134.4s)]
*  we could have another series of riots and protests that go really, really bad. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3139.28s)]
*  And so while I think Biden handled things completely wrong at the beginning, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3145.84s)]
*  I think with Harris, and she's saying she'll support the immigration bill that was bipartisan, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3150.2400000000002s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera, you guys know that. I think she has a more common sense approach [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3156.96s)]
*  to dealing with deportations and getting people through the asylum system. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3162.0s)]
*  And that bill, I think, said that it would reduce the amount of time to adjudicate asylum to 90 days, [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3166.24s)]
*  which means that there's a chance to get control of this before it turns into a riot. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3173.12s)]
*  Okay. So that was border was bad. Anything else bad, or should we shift to the good? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3177.04s)]
*  I think the spending was bad. I think that we overspent. And I think we went through a period [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3181.04s)]
*  where, and I'm not trying to make excuses for him. I just think, you guys mentioned this before, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3187.36s)]
*  he did overspend. And I think the infrastructure bill was good. I think the broadband bill was [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3191.6s)]
*  good. And everybody says we spent $42 billion on broadband and got nothing. We should have gone to [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3198.0s)]
*  Starlink. But the reality is the money went to the States and they could buy Starlink from Elon all [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3202.0s)]
*  they want. So that's just kind of the mainstream media poo-pooing something they shouldn't poo-poo. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3207.52s)]
*  But the EV stuff, the EV chargers, that's a cluster f***, and there's no way around that. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3212.16s)]
*  I think that was bad. So pork barrel spending, basically unaccountable spending. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3218.32s)]
*  Yeah. No, I think what they did in healthcare, you can take Lena Con and say what she's doing [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3224.0s)]
*  for the mergers, Albertsons and Kroger's, I think is too much. And I even told her this, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3230.08s)]
*  I sat on a panel sitting right next to her and I said, the most important thing from a technological [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3235.28s)]
*  perspective in this country today is that we win AI. That is going to find everything militarily [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3240.08s)]
*  for us and economically for us. And that when you try to break up companies like Google and [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3245.6s)]
*  Facebook, you diminish our ability to compete globally with AI. And she told me now that she [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3250.08s)]
*  didn't impact her at all, that she understands that and she's heard that before. I think their [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3255.7599999999998s)]
*  approach to that is wrong. I think that what she's done with the FTC against pharmacy benefit [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3260.08s)]
*  managers has been good, right? Pharmacy benefit managers are ripping off more companies and [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3266.16s)]
*  increasing the cost of medications more than anything else that's happening in healthcare. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3272.72s)]
*  And she's called them on the carpet with a recent report and just sued them. I think that's good. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3277.76s)]
*  I think in terms of other negatives, like Kamala Harris now, I think the filibuster, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3283.92s)]
*  I think that's a mistake to try to get rid of the filibuster because then somebody else gets rid of [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3290.48s)]
*  it for something else and it's just cascading problems. On spending, we talked about, I think [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3294.56s)]
*  he spent too much. And what have they done well? I think he changed the tone of the country. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3300.56s)]
*  I think that was really, really important. No one woke up, David calls it mean tweets, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3305.84s)]
*  but not waking up concerned about mean tweets is important. Not waking up concerned about there [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3310.72s)]
*  being some random tariff on your company that you didn't expect, not waking up being accused of [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3316.4s)]
*  doing something. I think those were all huge positives. I think supporting workers, I think [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3322.7999999999997s)]
*  just having just a sensibility of, okay, we're not in the middle of everything. There just wasn't [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3330.56s)]
*  this uncertainty like every single day that every business woke up with with Trump. Just [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3338.48s)]
*  removing that was the biggest positive of all. So let's look forward now to a Kamala Harris [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3342.7999999999997s)]
*  candidacy for president of the things. So we know the Donald Trump frack record because he gets [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3348.96s)]
*  the credit for the things he got right and he has to take ownership of the things. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3355.7599999999998s)]
*  But how it's been defined, I'll use the Yemen example again, I'll use the price example on oil [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3359.92s)]
*  again. We have Trumpnesia, right? We presume that what he did in terms of the economy and everything [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3364.88s)]
*  and no wars, everything was just rosy under Donald Trump. And I think that's another thing that's- [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3372.56s)]
*  I'll be honest, I've never heard this specific theory. I'll take the time to look and figure it [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3380.96s)]
*  out for myself. But what I'm curious about is that track record is there. Now, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3385.2000000000003s)]
*  and do you think it's important for us to give credit for the good things to Kamala and [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3390.8s)]
*  responsibility for the bad things to Kamala in that so that you have an equivalent A-B comparison? [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3396.32s)]
*  Do you think about it that way or not? No, I don't. And I'll tell you why. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3401.44s)]
*  I'm assuming all you guys have had a boss at one point or another. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3404.88s)]
*  Yes? Yeah. And do you all agree with everything that that boss did all the time? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3408.56s)]
*  No. No. No, but you had to do what the boss told you to do. And that's Kamala's job. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3413.4399999999996s)]
*  But I like to take credit for when the boss tells me I'm owning something and then I do it. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3420.08s)]
*  Well, but at the same time, you get credit for doing it, but it doesn't matter. If it turns out [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3424.56s)]
*  to be wrong, it's still the boss that's on the hook for it. What about the border, Mark? Because [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3430.56s)]
*  you made a comment about the border and she was declared the border czar. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3435.04s)]
*  Yeah. But again, that that's branding. I mean, we play branding games with politics all the time. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3438.48s)]
*  If you look at what her specific responsibility was, I alluded to it earlier. Her job was to go [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3443.84s)]
*  to Central America and talk to the heads of the countries there and try to reduce the reasons why [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3449.1200000000003s)]
*  people were leaving their countries to go to the United States. Why do you think they open the [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3454.6400000000003s)]
*  border so much? I'm wondering, Mark, there is a conspiracy theory or theory. You can you can pick [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3460.2400000000002s)]
*  how you want to frame it, that this is to increase the number of Democratic voters. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3465.76s)]
*  At the same time, we hear that a lot of the folks coming in who are the working class that the [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3469.92s)]
*  Republican Party is now the populist party. So those votes would go to the Republicans. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3473.5200000000004s)]
*  So, you know, I've heard this argument from both sides. What is another theory, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3477.36s)]
*  an economic theory, Mark, which is that it increases the base of workers when we're at [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3480.8s)]
*  our lowest unemployment rate in history, and inflation is raging. So by bringing in low cost [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3486.48s)]
*  workers that you're that you're able to get to work at a lower wage rate, you actually have a [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3491.6s)]
*  deflationary effect and a stimulatory effect because then they end up being spenders as well. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3496.64s)]
*  And I get the logic there. I don't think they're I think maybe they might have thought of that [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3500.0s)]
*  earlier. And that's why they let too many people in. But I think they realize now that they screwed [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3504.3199999999997s)]
*  up. And that shouldn't be an executive authority, right? I mean, that should be like a legislative [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3509.7599999999998s)]
*  congressional authority that makes that decision and that determination on whether to change [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3514.88s)]
*  immigration policy. Do you think that the executive branch should be able to unilaterally [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3518.72s)]
*  determine who comes into the country without following laws? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3523.12s)]
*  No, I prefer that Congress does it. Unfortunately, that's just not what worked. Look at the SEC with [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3526.0s)]
*  Gary Gensler, the guy's a moron. And but, you know, they're we got to go that actually. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3531.04s)]
*  Yeah, so that's the area we can agree on before we get to that. So your claim on [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3538.56s)]
*  we finally found ground truth. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3542.56s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3544.32s)]
*  No, we can agree on that. We'll get to that. But before we do that, I just want to finish [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3544.8s)]
*  up on border here. So your claim is that Kamala Harris really wanted to seal the border, [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3551.36s)]
*  but she was prevented. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3556.56s)]
*  No, that's not what I said at all. David, you're really good at trying to position things. So you [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3558.0s)]
*  have, you know, you have talking points to go out with. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3563.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm just you said that this is a case of a VP who was thwarted by her boss. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3566.48s)]
*  No, that is not what I said. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3572.7200000000003s)]
*  That is not what you admit. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3574.32s)]
*  You are the king of virtue signaling, David. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3575.44s)]
*  Okay. So the truth is she was on board with Joe Biden's agenda. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3579.52s)]
*  I don't know. She's doing what she was told. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3582.96s)]
*  Which one is it? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3585.6800000000003s)]
*  There's no you're creating false choices, David. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3586.8s)]
*  You're creating false. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3589.6000000000004s)]
*  So David, if you do the job your boss told you to do, does that do you make a declaration [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3591.12s)]
*  before you do it? If I agree or disagree, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3597.12s)]
*  she disagree with Joe Biden about these policies. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3600.0s)]
*  Because I see what she's doing now. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3601.84s)]
*  Well, she changed the policy, right? She has a different policy. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3604.08s)]
*  It's an election year conversion. She realizes what a disaster it's been. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3606.4s)]
*  So when you hope does it, it's brilliant. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3609.92s)]
*  When I give you the proof, okay, her own word, okay, she flipped her position. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3612.64s)]
*  She called Trump's border wall un-American and medieval and mocked it. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3617.36s)]
*  And this is before she became Biden's vice president. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3622.0s)]
*  And right around the same time. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3623.6800000000003s)]
*  Hold on. When she was in the Senate and Trump was trying to build the wall, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3625.2000000000003s)]
*  remember Democrats tried to thwart that, they subjected him to years of litigation [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3628.4s)]
*  to prevent him from building that wall. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3632.48s)]
*  And she multiple times was on record saying the wall was un-American, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3634.2400000000002s)]
*  medieval, mocked and so forth. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3639.44s)]
*  She also compared ICE to the KKK. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3641.0400000000004s)]
*  She said that images of border patrol agents evoke slavery. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3644.56s)]
*  Okay, this is her rhetoric. I don't think Joe Biden made her say that. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3648.0s)]
*  She suggested that we abolish ICE and start from scratch. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3651.44s)]
*  Okay. And now she wants to talk about how tough she is on the border. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3654.48s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3658.56s)]
*  Maybe she talked to JD Vance back then and was taking his positions. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3659.7599999999998s)]
*  People change their mind for whatever reason. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3664.48s)]
*  People learn your positioning as- [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3666.8799999999997s)]
*  Okay. So for, so hold on. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3668.96s)]
*  So throughout her whole time in the Senate, she was arguing against the border wall. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3670.8s)]
*  Okay. In the strongest possible language. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3674.5600000000004s)]
*  She then becomes border czar, or you could call it point person for the Biden administration. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3676.7200000000003s)]
*  And for three years, they gaslit us that the border was not a problem. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3681.6800000000003s)]
*  That was not an open festering wound. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3685.92s)]
*  Like the videos were constantly coming out. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3687.92s)]
*  I remember on the show, we talked about it. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3690.32s)]
*  And I was told when I raised the issue of the border, that was a conspiracy theory, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3692.1600000000003s)]
*  that Fox News was just cherry picking videos. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3695.28s)]
*  Remember that, Jason? In any event- [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3697.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Well, people were actually, it was interesting to bring that up because people [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3699.04s)]
*  were sharing videos and playing them on Fox that were from like 10 years ago. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3702.0s)]
*  So there was a lot of misinformation. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3706.96s)]
*  The Democrats, the whole Democratic Party- [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3708.4s)]
*  You know the thing about caravans, David, all those caravans never made it to the border. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3709.6s)]
*  How many caravans did we hear about that were coming? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3713.2s)]
*  Something like over 10 million migrants have entered the country during the Biden-Harris [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3714.88s)]
*  administration. The first thing they did- [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3719.6s)]
*  First of all, we don't know. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3722.08s)]
*  When Biden, when Biden, no, we know about the- [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3723.44s)]
*  First of all, we don't know. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3726.48s)]
*  No, no, we do know. Those 10 million are just the border encounters. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3726.56s)]
*  Those are the recorded crossings that they led into the country. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3730.32s)]
*  The number we don't know is whether how many more were not recorded. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3733.68s)]
*  The encounters are not just- [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3737.36s)]
*  That's not going to be 20 or 30 million. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3738.32s)]
*  Well, you can look up on encounters. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3739.2799999999997s)]
*  Why did this happen? I'll tell you why. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3741.04s)]
*  When Joe Biden took office, he repealed all of Trump's executive orders. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3742.7999999999997s)]
*  No, he did not. What is it, Section 42? [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3746.64s)]
*  90 of them. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3748.7999999999997s)]
*  What's the- 90 of them. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3749.2799999999997s)]
*  Title 42. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3750.08s)]
*  Title 42 stuck around until the end of 23. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3750.7999999999997s)]
*  In addition, they got rid of Trump's remain in Mexico policy, and they changed the meaning of [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3754.56s)]
*  asylum so that anyone who went to the border and said that they were suffering economic hardship, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3758.8s)]
*  which is basically the whole world, okay, could now qualify for asylum. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3763.1200000000003s)]
*  They were given a ticket to appear in court one day, like three years, five years, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3766.88s)]
*  and they were ushered into the country. Then there were nonprofits working with the Biden [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3770.96s)]
*  administration to put them on buses and planes, and they were shipped all over the country. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3774.8s)]
*  I agree they screwed up on the border. I'm not arguing with you on that. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3778.6400000000003s)]
*  This is more than a screw up. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3781.1200000000003s)]
*  No, fine. They screwed up, but now we are back where Trump was. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3782.64s)]
*  The commonwealth has defended it. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3785.52s)]
*  Yeah, but she changed, just like JD Vance. JD Vance called him Hitler. JD Vance in 2020, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3787.52s)]
*  and after, diminished Donald Trump. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3794.16s)]
*  No, that was in private communications in 2016, and JD Vance explained, including last night, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3796.24s)]
*  why he changed his mind about that. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3801.04s)]
*  Right, and that's fine. So he talked to people. So did she, representing the state of- [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3802.16s)]
*  This was her position like six months ago, and now all of a sudden she's the nominee, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3806.64s)]
*  so she's going to vote no. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3811.04s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. You're trying, you're virtue signaling like a mother****, right? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3812.24s)]
*  You're trying to put, you're trying to brand anything. You tried to brand anything that you [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3816.48s)]
*  disagree with that you think is a negative and just put it on her, which is politics 101, right? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3821.44s)]
*  But you're not looking at what she's actually doing. What she's actually doing- [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3826.88s)]
*  She was the point person for the administration. Okay, look, when- [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3829.92s)]
*  What you're saying doesn't matter if she was in charge, and she said, you know what? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3832.72s)]
*  What you want her to do is like JD Vance said about abortion, right? I talked to somebody, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3838.24s)]
*  and they proved it. Great. That was a smart move by him. Would it be smart for her to say, [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3843.12s)]
*  I was wrong? Now I've learned more and I've picked up more information. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3847.7599999999998s)]
*  Now- That's actually a good question for you, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3851.52s)]
*  Sax. If JD Vance can lobby and want a national abortion ban and then change his mind as the [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3853.12s)]
*  number two for Trump, can Kamala change her mind when she is no longer running for [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3860.0s)]
*  the number two seat as Biden? I think JD explained why he changed his mind about that. He said that [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3868.16s)]
*  there was a referendum in Ohio and his side lost. So he can change his mind, can Kamala, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3873.6s)]
*  and you have the grace for Kamala to change her mind or not? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3878.88s)]
*  Hold on a second. He's taking a learning from that. Kamala Harris has never explained why [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3881.2799999999997s)]
*  she changed her mind. In fact, in the meantime- [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3884.7999999999997s)]
*  Hold on a second. When will the media even ask her this question? She doesn't submit for interviews, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3886.72s)]
*  and certainly the debate moderators, like on ABC, never asked her a question. Mark, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3891.52s)]
*  she's going to change her mind or she's going to have this election year conversion. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3897.6s)]
*  Why doesn't the media ask her, what is the basis of this? When did you change your mind? Was it [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3900.64s)]
*  five minutes ago? Why then did you support Biden throughout your entire last three and a half years? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3904.24s)]
*  Why don't they ask her these questions? If you were part of the Biden administration, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3910.88s)]
*  why did you volunteer to be the border czar if you disagree with Joe Biden about these policies? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3914.24s)]
*  When exactly did you change your mind? Those are the questions that she should be answering. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3918.72s)]
*  Why won't she answer- Those are the questions that you want- [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3922.56s)]
*  Why won't she submit to an advertiser or whatever? No, those are the questions that you want [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3923.92s)]
*  so that you think you can put her on the defensive and get and have- [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3927.28s)]
*  I think it's what's the country wants to know. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3931.44s)]
*  No, look, you want to know, but let me just tell you what's important. Put yourself in the shoes, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3933.76s)]
*  let's just call this a business, right? And the business of this business is getting votes [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3939.6000000000004s)]
*  and winning this election. And you came in and the product that you originally had, New Coke, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3944.8s)]
*  failed, right? Biden's New Coke in this example. And you come in and you say, I'm bringing it back, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3951.44s)]
*  this is the new New Coke. And we're going to test to see if that's working. Well, when you brought [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3957.2s)]
*  in Kamala Harris, she had no favorable ratings whatsoever. She was behind in all polling right [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3962.0s)]
*  where Joe Biden was. And now she's either even or ahead or a little bit behind in every single poll. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3969.12s)]
*  And why do I bring it up? Because it means what she's doing is working. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3976.24s)]
*  I think we actually agree. I think we actually have found a point to agree on, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3979.6s)]
*  which is I think Kamala Harris is just saying whatever it takes to get elected. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3983.44s)]
*  You can say the same thing about JD Vance. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3987.36s)]
*  Hold on. She stated her true belief years ago and throughout the Biden administration, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3989.2000000000003s)]
*  which is she never believed the border was a problem. She thought the border wall, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3993.28s)]
*  Trump's wall was un-American and medieval. And she thought that ICE needed to be abolished. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=3996.4s)]
*  I think that was her true belief. Now, if it's not her true belief, I would like her to explain [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4000.2400000000002s)]
*  when she changed her belief and why the same way that JD Vance did. And I think the American [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4005.28s)]
*  people are entitled to know that. And I think if the media was doing its job, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4010.0s)]
*  they'd be asking her those questions. She's never been asked that. Stephanie Wuhl, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4013.2s)]
*  in her latest interview, did not ask that. And the debate moderators do not ask that. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4017.52s)]
*  Let's just go outside of America for one second, because Mark, you're Jewish, you're of Jewish [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4021.76s)]
*  heritage. I would really like your opinion on what's happening outside of America. There is [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4026.32s)]
*  some crazy pictures over the last few weeks coming out from the Middle East. There's still [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4033.2s)]
*  all this complicating stuff with China. Where do you stand on all of these things? Where do you [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4038.32s)]
*  stand on the Mearsheimer Sachs, Jeffrey Sachs kind of school of logic that there's a military [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4045.44s)]
*  industrial complex that tends to just push us towards these war zones and these forever wars? [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4053.44s)]
*  Where do you just stand on those issues? And how do you think about that? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4058.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, honestly, I don't have enough information to give you a qualified response. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4061.36s)]
*  I'm pro-Israel to the core because I'm Jewish. I'm anti-Hamas to the core. I think they're terrorists. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4065.9199999999996s)]
*  They are terrorists. I want to see Israel succeed. I want to see the United States support them and [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4073.3599999999997s)]
*  help them in that. But when Israel was going into Gaza, I thought it was too blunt an instrument. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4080.7999999999997s)]
*  But when they went after Hezbollah, I thought they did it the exact right way. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4088.7999999999997s)]
*  And so, you know, I'm always only going to respond to what I see. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4092.4s)]
*  You have a nuanced opinion of this. Yeah. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4096.0s)]
*  And Ukraine? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4098.08s)]
*  Yeah. Ukraine, I don't want to see American blood spilled. And as long as there's a NATO, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4098.96s)]
*  and I agree there should be a NATO, I'd rather see us spend money than put soldiers in harm's way. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4103.76s)]
*  And so- [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4109.28s)]
*  Does the Harris campaign agree on that point? Or do they have a point of view? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4110.24s)]
*  I haven't had that conversation. I haven't had that conversation with them. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4113.4400000000005s)]
*  Let me ask you just a point on arithmetic, which I think is the most important arithmetic we should [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4116.64s)]
*  all be talking about. Today is the first, yesterday was the first day of the federal- [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4122.400000000001s)]
*  Fiscal year. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4127.76s)]
*  Fiscal year, right? And here's a little image for us to all look at together as a group, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4128.400000000001s)]
*  an image that everyone should wake up every morning in the United States and look at. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4134.4800000000005s)]
*  The first thing they do instead of looking at Twitter, they should look at the image that I'm [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4137.76s)]
*  sharing on the screen right now, which is federal debt in the United States. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4140.88s)]
*  I thought this should be a screen of you taking a bath. This is just- [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4145.36s)]
*  On the first day of the new fiscal year, federal debt jumped by $204 billion in one day. Federal [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4148.8s)]
*  debt now stands at $35.7 trillion. And the biggest challenge we have in the year ahead [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4155.6s)]
*  is that 10 trillion of the outstanding debt comes up for refinance. It's going to refinance at [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4162.16s)]
*  around 4%. So we're going to be adding another $300 billion in new interest expense next fiscal [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4168.16s)]
*  year, plus the Biden administration has proposed a $7.2 trillion budget for next year, which will [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4174.72s)]
*  inevitably lead to another $2 trillion of deficit spending, which means that by the end of 2025, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4181.599999999999s)]
*  we could be staring at $40 trillion of federal debt. And if you do the math on that at 4% interest, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4188.639999999999s)]
*  it's 1.6 trillion a year of interest expense a year, just on interest expense on the outstanding [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4195.2s)]
*  debt, which effectively begins to eclipse the entire federal budget very quickly and gives us [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4200.639999999999s)]
*  no ability to maneuver, to meet the needs of all the policy demands that are being described and [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4206.96s)]
*  shaped in all of these elections and all of these debates and all the bullsh** that's going on [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4212.4s)]
*  is really not fundable. What does the Harris campaign say about the situation with respect [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4216.639999999999s)]
*  to deficit spending and debt? And I don't know how high you can raise taxes and not cut spending [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4222.0s)]
*  to even make a dent in the challenge ahead without driving a massive recession. What do you think [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4228.96s)]
*  the Harris versus the Trump campaign's kind of intentions are as we look at this abyss that [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4235.84s)]
*  we're now kind of jumping into? Yeah, I can't speak for them. I can only tell you the conversations [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4240.56s)]
*  I've had and what they've said to me, whether or not they take these directions is completely up [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4244.64s)]
*  to them and I don't know. But I've said the exact same thing. They know that the deficit's a problem. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4248.4s)]
*  It won't be a Biden budget. There's no Biden administration to happen. They've already, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4255.92s)]
*  just the tax rates are completely different than the Biden budget proposals where there's no [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4262.879999999999s)]
*  unrealized capital gains, et cetera. They went to 28 and 28%. So it's not going to be what was [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4268.5599999999995s)]
*  proposed by Biden. There's a limit on tax basically, right? Like that people will vote for. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4275.28s)]
*  There's a point of diminishing returns and raising taxes and they realize it, right? So when we [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4279.679999999999s)]
*  talked about unrealized capital gains and I gave them a thousand reasons why not, they're like, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4283.28s)]
*  we already know this, yada yada. Now to David's point, why don't they just come out and say it? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4286.48s)]
*  Because the 1% of high information voters don't know the difference of unrealized capital gains [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4291.36s)]
*  or not and don't care. The 99% want to hear about the things that they're talking about. So [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4296.16s)]
*  that's why people like me can go out there and talk about it. But to your point and the bigger [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4301.2s)]
*  point, David, that they've realized that there's only a couple of ways to reduce the deficit. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4304.72s)]
*  One, you get inflation under control and that reduces interest rates and that's going to work [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4311.280000000001s)]
*  in our favor. And I think that's happening now. If it's $1.6 trillion, then if interest rates go [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4315.6s)]
*  below 4%, that saves a lot of money and probably the most you can save. They realized efficiency [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4320.8s)]
*  is an important element. In her last speech in Pittsburgh, she talked about how long it only took [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4326.64s)]
*  one year to build the Empire State Building. That is crazy. There's too much friction in the [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4332.08s)]
*  government to be able to do building the right way. They're going to reduce friction. I've had [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4336.4s)]
*  conversations with them about AI as a service and being able to optimize integrating artificial [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4340.88s)]
*  intelligence into all these processes so that they don't have to keep on hiring people. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4349.68s)]
*  I don't think their mindset, again, I'm speaking for myself and my perspective of my conversations [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4353.76s)]
*  with them. I don't think their mindset is to just go out there and just cut a ton of people, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4358.24s)]
*  but I do think the mindset is how can we implement technology to become more efficient [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4362.32s)]
*  so that we can provide more value to the citizens of this country at less cost. I think that's [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4366.96s)]
*  important to them. I think you're going to see a lot of reduction. I'm trying to think of the best [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4372.32s)]
*  way to say it. She knows that technology is the ultimate driver of success. And if she supports new [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4379.2s)]
*  technologies, and you heard that again in Pittsburgh, she mentioned blockchain, but more [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4386.96s)]
*  importantly, she mentioned AI and how AI is key to us having our military be dominant and to have [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4391.36s)]
*  our economy grow. Because the other way to get results isn't just a slash and burn like Vivek [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4401.68s)]
*  wants to do, but to grow the economy and that there truly are ways to grow the economy without [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4407.04s)]
*  just more spending. But do you support Elon Musk going in? If you're saying shed regulatory [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4412.08s)]
*  burden, shed inefficiency, improve productivity, don't we need an Elon Musk style model that [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4418.08s)]
*  Trump has talked about with Elon? Send someone in and let's go fix the inefficiency across all [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4423.84s)]
*  of the administrative efforts run by the federal government. First of all, when you do a Vivek type, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4429.04s)]
*  just cut the Department of Education. Whatever it is, we don't know what Elon would actually do. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4437.28s)]
*  Well, I think that triggers a recession because then you got a lot of people unemployed, right? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4441.36s)]
*  Yeah, exactly right. And there's contracts. And so that means the United States of America [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4444.16s)]
*  is violating all these contracts with small businesses and medium-sized businesses. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4448.08s)]
*  And maybe Elon put Doge in the Treasury, who knows? And that's how we make it all up. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4453.36s)]
*  But you can't just crap and slash and burn, to your point, Dave. I mean, it just won't work. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4458.799999999999s)]
*  And so what you can do though, is introduce technology. We have yet to have a president [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4463.12s)]
*  that fully understands technology. I'm not here to tell you that Kamala Harris is a geek. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4468.56s)]
*  She's not. But she understands the impact and she has a lot of people who truly are geeks around [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4473.92s)]
*  her. And she truly believes that implementing technology is a way to improve efficiency. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4480.160000000001s)]
*  But the whole idea is you can't take the libertarian approach. That's ideologic. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4486.4800000000005s)]
*  You have to take a problem-solving approach. How do you look at any specific problem we're trying [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4490.56s)]
*  to solve? How can you apply technology to that? I think you will get that from the Harris [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4495.92s)]
*  administration, as opposed to Donald just talking about the AI and how much energy it consumes. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4501.2s)]
*  Mark, you said, of all the roles, if there's a Harris administration, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4506.72s)]
*  you said you want to run the SECY. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4512.0s)]
*  That was bullsh-t. I was just trolling Gary Gensler. Yeah. I was just trolling Gary Gensler [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4513.76s)]
*  because it's fun to do. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4517.68s)]
*  Okay. So do you think just you... And particularly wise, Gensler, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4519.28s)]
*  has he done a particularly bad job? [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4523.28s)]
*  Are you just trolling David Sacks when you say you're... [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4525.84s)]
*  Mark is trolling me now, right? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4528.0s)]
*  I can't keep up with the trolling. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4530.08s)]
*  And I think you can control the trolling. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4531.2s)]
*  This is an area where I agree with Mark. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4533.52s)]
*  Nested trolling. Nested trolling. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4534.4800000000005s)]
*  No. So Mark, you are actually supporting... [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4535.84s)]
*  Mark is actually supporting Trump. He's just trolling Sacks and coming on the show. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4538.4800000000005s)]
*  He's been going on for weeks. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4541.2s)]
*  No, no. I know he's not supporting Trump. But I tell you, one Republican that, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4542.24s)]
*  as I understand it, you are supporting is John Deaton, who is running against Elizabeth Warren [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4546.96s)]
*  in the Massachusetts Senate race. So I'm curious about this because I think this is an area we [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4551.36s)]
*  could agree on. You're not a fan of Elizabeth Warren at all. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4556.4s)]
*  I didn't know that. That's pretty interesting. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4559.12s)]
*  Yeah. I'm not a fan of Elizabeth Warren. I've talked to her about crypto. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4561.36s)]
*  I understand her position. Her basic position is bad nation states use crypto to fund their [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4565.12s)]
*  operations, the bad stuff. And she just wants to throw the baby out with the bathwater as opposed [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4570.799999999999s)]
*  to using... Like I proposed a blacklist from OFAC that can be implemented and all kinds of [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4575.44s)]
*  s***. I need to get into the details. But it just wasn't going to happen. And so when John, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4582.16s)]
*  not just being pro crypto, but his background, his character, I thought really was a positive. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4587.599999999999s)]
*  And so even before he got through his hat in his ring, I was talking to him, supporting him, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4593.44s)]
*  giving him feedback and helping him. So again, I'm not a Democrat. I have no problem. And I think [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4597.919999999999s)]
*  John Deaton will be better for the country, better third of the citizens of Massachusetts [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4603.76s)]
*  than Elizabeth Warren would be. What would be common sense crypto [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4607.360000000001s)]
*  regulation? Obviously you don't want people bilking people out of their money. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4611.12s)]
*  So what would be a way to balance accredited investors versus the populace, non-sophisticated [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4616.0s)]
*  investors, if that's even a thing, and people running amok? [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4622.24s)]
*  Right. So I've got a company called Lazy.com. If you go to Lazy.com slash M.Cuban, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4626.16s)]
*  you'll see all my NFTs. And all it is is a way to display your NFTs. It's hardly makes any money. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4630.8s)]
*  But I wanted to see if we could release a token. So first thing I did was I had one of our people [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4636.88s)]
*  call the SEC and say, Hey, what steps do we have to take to release the token? They went through [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4641.12s)]
*  this whole rigmarole about getting securities lawyers and this and that. There's no way a company [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4646.320000000001s)]
*  with a hundred thousand dollars in revenue is going to be able to afford to do that. So then I [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4650.72s)]
*  said, okay, I'm going to go right to the sec.gov and see about reg A and see if I could just fill [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4654.24s)]
*  out the forms myself and just see what. So you start filling in name address, then you get to [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4659.44s)]
*  the type of business and the only category is other. And once you follow that other connection, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4664.799999999999s)]
*  there's just no way to put the round the just there's no way to make it work. You can't make [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4671.44s)]
*  it work. And I actually said that directly to Gary Gensler. And so to answer your question, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4677.679999999999s)]
*  you have to make it easy to follow the rules and you can't. And in terms of everything being a [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4682.48s)]
*  security, Gensler says everything applies to how we, right? There's a how we roll and everything, [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4688.4s)]
*  you know, but the reality is there's also a rule that came after really came after called Reeves [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4694.16s)]
*  Reeves versus Ernst and Young that had to do with interest. And if you think about it, if you guys [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4700.16s)]
*  ever shorted stocks or done stock loan where you can make some money off of stock loan, a borrower. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4704.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So what, you know, you can make a share, you can make one of your shares of stocks available [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4710.4s)]
*  to the borrower and get paid a VIG, right? You might get 10 or 12%. And so doing that [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4714.24s)]
*  is the exact same thing as loaning out Bitcoin for somebody else to borrow. And there's no, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4720.48s)]
*  they don't call that a security. So I asked, I asked Gary Gensler, if it's not a security to loan [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4726.08s)]
*  out a share of stock, and why is it, you know, a security to loan out a Bitcoin to somebody else? [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4731.04s)]
*  That didn't have an answer. And the point there is he has an approach that is regulation through [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4740.08s)]
*  litigation. He's going to sue you first, ask questions later, and hope that the result of [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4746.64s)]
*  that litigation becomes a rule that everybody else has to follow. I literally said, what's that? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4753.12s)]
*  Well, I was gonna say, wouldn't a more common sense approach here be to say, [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4759.28s)]
*  if we had an accreditation test, a sophisticated investor test, we've talked about it here on the [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4762.8s)]
*  program. Well, there's not one for the populace to take like a driver's license where they could [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4766.8s)]
*  say, Hey, I've taken this test, I understand diversity, diversification, etc. Yeah. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4774.08s)]
*  If you're able to register with the securities and exchange commission for your company for the [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4779.2s)]
*  release of your token, then depending on how many people you're trying to sell it to, you would only [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4784.72s)]
*  be able to do that with qualified investors. Right. But what happens is Gary Gensler is making it so [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4789.2s)]
*  difficult to register. And what he's what he should be doing is saying, here's the bright line [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4795.68s)]
*  regulations. If FTX wants to loan out all their Ethereum, you have to do what they did in Japan. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4800.400000000001s)]
*  You have to have 95% collateral and 95% of anything needs to be put in cold storage. If he had followed [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4807.92s)]
*  the same rules for crypto that Japan did, FTX would still be in business. Sam Bankman Fried might [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4814.64s)]
*  still be in jail, but FTX three hours capital, they'd still be in business, because he did the [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4819.44s)]
*  wrong thing. Now, I've literally talked to Kamala Harris at lunch about this specific topic of [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4825.36s)]
*  litigation regulation through litigation. And as a lawyer, she got it immediately. And she knows [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4831.2s)]
*  it's a problem. And they know and she's even mentioned in one of her speeches that that's [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4835.919999999999s)]
*  something that they're going to deal with. Can I get your reaction to this story from [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4840.0s)]
*  the Washington reporter? There was a story I don't know if it's true or not. But [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4844.0s)]
*  Washington reporters. So according to some Senate sources, Kamala Harris was considering [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4848.96s)]
*  Gensler for Treasury Secretary. I would call that bullsh**. Okay, what's the Washington reporter? [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4854.5599999999995s)]
*  I haven't asked her about any position at all. But what I was told and look, talking to people [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4859.599999999999s)]
*  who are like, always in the same room with her. The response to me about Gary Gensler was, have [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4867.2s)]
*  you heard anybody say anything positive? That's intentional. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4873.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, the reason he's in that role is because he is Elizabeth Warren's right ally. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4879.6s)]
*  And he has been enormously powerful during the Biden administration. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4885.76s)]
*  Have you heard her say a word? Mark, Mark, boil it all up. Like, what's [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4890.0s)]
*  your general sense of her? Like, how should we all think about her? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4893.28s)]
*  So here's the way I look at Kamala, right? She is open minded. She's smart. She does the work. She [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4896.32s)]
*  digs in and learns. She's ethical. She's honest. She cares. She wants to bring the country to the [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4902.56s)]
*  middle. She knows that when she was far left, that might have been great for the state of California, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4910.240000000001s)]
*  but it doesn't solve the problems of the United States of America today. And that's why you've [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4916.240000000001s)]
*  seen her go to the middle. And that is truly, I know, David, you might not believe this, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4922.400000000001s)]
*  it is truly honest and through and through her. When she gave give speeches now, she says, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4926.8s)]
*  I'll take ideas from independents. I'll take them from Republicans. I don't care. We have a lot of [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4932.56s)]
*  problems to solve in this country. I would be shocked if, if she wins, she talks to Elon Musk, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4937.68s)]
*  if Elon would talk to her. She doesn't care where the ideas come from. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4943.2s)]
*  Interviews with unfriendly or challenging folks. This seems to be like, you know, a really valid [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4946.72s)]
*  criticism. I mean, we've had Trump here. We've had Jay DeVance here. Yeah. I don't disagree. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4952.8s)]
*  Why does she hide? Do you think? I don't think she's hiding. There's two elements there, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4960.320000000001s)]
*  one, I think she understands the assignment which is to win the election. And the best way to reach [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4964.400000000001s)]
*  the most number of people and get them to change their mind is not the 1% of people who are high [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4969.6s)]
*  information voters. It's all the people who are showing up at rallies and screaming and yelling. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4974.64s)]
*  Those are the people whose mind she has changed so far and that's how she's caught up and who she [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4979.2s)]
*  wants to change. And that's where she's putting her focus. And two, and this is really honest, [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4984.96s)]
*  she has too long a windup in answering every single question. And that makes the interviews [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4990.72s)]
*  difficult. She wants to inspire everybody with everything that she answers and tries to get [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=4996.16s)]
*  people all excited about what she's going to do. And so she takes too long to get to that. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5001.679999999999s)]
*  If you cut out the windups, her answers aren't so bad. Her answers are actually legit, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5006.88s)]
*  but that windup makes it seem like the whole word salad thing. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5012.4800000000005s)]
*  You don't think it's relevant that she was born to a middle-class family as the answer to [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5015.92s)]
*  how she's going to solve inflation? And I said she's got to drop that. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5019.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. But on the flip side, I mean, if you listen, I literally, because I knew I'd be talking to you [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5021.76s)]
*  guys, I listened to Donald Trump's speech in Milwaukee. Did any of you guys listen to that? [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5026.24s)]
*  Yes. I was there. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5031.76s)]
*  Okay. You were there, Sax? [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5033.2s)]
*  I was there. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5035.200000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, not Milwaukee, not the convention. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5035.700000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, not the RNC, not the RNC. He's saying this week. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5037.200000000001s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm talking two days ago. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5040.320000000001s)]
*  No, I'm talking about the RNC. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5042.080000000001s)]
*  So Kamala might have a long windup. Donald Trump has an eternal windup, where all he does is get to [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5044.0s)]
*  his slogans and talking points and then talks gibberish the rest of the time. Let me fill you [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5050.96s)]
*  in on some of the gibberish. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5056.320000000001s)]
*  You're talking about a rally? He will speak extemporaneously for over an hour. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5057.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but what he says shouldn't matter. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5060.64s)]
*  I'll take that any day over someone on a teleprompter for 19 minutes. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5062.08s)]
*  So what you're saying, it doesn't matter what he says? [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5065.12s)]
*  No, I think it does matter. But I think that I've watched enough Trump rallies, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5067.6s)]
*  including his speech at the convention where I was there listening to understand what issues he [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5073.04s)]
*  stands for. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5078.48s)]
*  Okay. Well, tell me what issues he stands for when he diminishes Jimmy Carter, who just has his [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5078.96s)]
*  100th birthday. Tell me what issues he stands for. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5084.08s)]
*  I've heard him say good things and bad things about Jimmy Carter. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5087.04s)]
*  Okay. So let's put that aside. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5089.04s)]
*  Everyone makes fun of Jimmy Carter. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5089.68s)]
*  Okay. So let's put that aside. Let's just say it is what it is, even though it's [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5091.28s)]
*  aside. We'll go that put that under the character. He started talking about apartments with no [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5094.88s)]
*  windows that builders under Kamala Harris are going to start are being forced to build [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5099.679999999999s)]
*  apartments with no windows. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5104.48s)]
*  I haven't heard that bit yet. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5106.16s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, I listened to this today. And then he also said that I also know that people take a [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5107.44s)]
*  lot of what Trump says out of context to make it seem a lot worse. If you listen to if you listen [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5112.5599999999995s)]
*  to what he says and you don't try to shade it in the worst possible way, a lot of what he says [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5118.0s)]
*  makes sense. I believe that if you want to know why I support Trump, number one, the border. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5124.24s)]
*  Okay. Unlike Kamala Harris's election year conversion, he has been very consistent ever [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5129.76s)]
*  since he came down the escalator that we needed to have a wall. And that really that was just the [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5134.96s)]
*  first part of our border security. We needed to have a border Democrats, not just Kamala, pretty [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5140.88s)]
*  much all the Democrats fought him on that for the last eight years to the point where I understand. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5145.6s)]
*  I understand. So the border is one thing. So you get that. Okay. So I think that he and only he [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5150.240000000001s)]
*  has credibility in this election on that issue. Number two, that's fine on the on the foreign wars. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5155.68s)]
*  We talked about this. I mean, I don't think his record on foreign policy was perfect, but it is [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5161.92s)]
*  true that he did not start any new foreign wars and the set. No, what were the Joe Biden side? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5167.120000000001s)]
*  The Ukraine war. We could have ended that. Ukraine. I've argued on the show many times. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5173.84s)]
*  He provoked it. Okay. He provoked it. Okay. So you're assigning whatever to Joe Biden. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5179.6s)]
*  He forced Putin to invade Ukraine. Come on, stop acting dumb. You understand that we try to convert [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5185.6s)]
*  Ukraine into a giant NATO base. That was the Russians said over and over again that that was [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5193.6s)]
*  a red line to them. It was the brightest of all. But to blame it on Biden's. And Bill Burns, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5198.56s)]
*  our current CIA director, said it best. It's the brightest of all red lines for the Russian elite, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5203.92s)]
*  not just Putin. Okay. That has been a consistent Russian policy for over 20 years. And moreover, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5210.24s)]
*  hold on a second, even if you don't believe, even if you disagree with me and you say that Biden [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5215.76s)]
*  didn't provoke it, we had the chance to end the war in its first month with a deal in Istanbul. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5220.16s)]
*  Okay. And the mainstream media denied it for a year. It was only an alternative media. And then [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5224.8s)]
*  finally the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal wrote stories about it. It is the truth. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5230.16s)]
*  Victoria Nuland just admitted it. We could have agreed to a deal in the first month. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5233.92s)]
*  The Biden administration shot that down. That is why we have the war going in Ukraine. Okay. So [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5237.76s)]
*  let's just say- That's a fact. Remember, the list is also got to agree with it. And that war's been [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5241.599999999999s)]
*  incredibly destructive. And by the way, if you care about Israel, hold on, Mark, if you care about [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5244.96s)]
*  Israel, you should be really concerned about the fact that the United States has significantly [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5248.88s)]
*  depleted its stockpiles of weapons and artillery ammunition in Ukraine on a war that is futile. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5253.28s)]
*  We sent them our old s**t, David. We didn't give them anything new. We sent them our old s**t. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5260.08s)]
*  Israel gets the Glenn Gary leads. 155 millimeter artillery shells are [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5264.48s)]
*  155 millimeter artillery shells. It's not about new or old. Okay. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5269.599999999999s)]
*  They get the Glenn Gary lead. Israel gets the Glenn Gary leads. Right. And look, on top of that, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5272.8s)]
*  Zelensky- There's only so much air defense. There's only so many patriots to go around. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5278.24s)]
*  All right. Do you agree that Zelensky could have said yes to that deal? [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5282.64s)]
*  The one in Istanbul? Yeah. He could only say yes to it if the US supported it. And instead, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5289.6s)]
*  we encouraged him to fight. We threw cold water on that deal. We blocked it. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5294.96s)]
*  We should have told Zelensky, you know what? Just make that deal. We don't need another war right [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5300.56s)]
*  now. Okay. This NATO thing's not happening anyway. Okay. Because we're not letting Zelensky into NATO. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5305.12s)]
*  Well, no, the guy from Norway, the guy who just took over NATO says otherwise. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5310.88s)]
*  We're not going to let in. Zelensky was just here in the US last week with his so-called [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5315.52s)]
*  victory plan. You know what his victory plan was? Let us into NATO immediately so that you can fight [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5319.6s)]
*  our war for us. No, I get that. The Biden administration, to its credit, rejected that. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5324.72s)]
*  Okay. I give Biden credit for that. The good news is Biden is not running in this election. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5329.360000000001s)]
*  Whenever it's inconvenient, you want to pretend that Harris has nothing to do with this [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5333.68s)]
*  administration. No, I'm just giving you reality. She's the incumbent. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5338.88s)]
*  I'm giving you reality. When I've had people who worked for me and went out and started their own [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5340.8s)]
*  companies like Shemath and Facebook, people have different opinions. The people who work for me [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5345.6s)]
*  do what I say. Period. End of story. Maybe they do a better job on what- [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5351.2s)]
*  So she was just following orders, basically, the Nuremberg defense. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5354.88s)]
*  Do you think JD Vance is going to do anything contrary to Donald Trump if he wins? [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5358.16s)]
*  There's an abundant record. I know what JD Vance stands for. There was an abundant record- [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5363.360000000001s)]
*  That's not the question. That's not the question. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5366.56s)]
*  Of Kamala Harris as a senator before she even got the VP job. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5367.84s)]
*  That's not the question. She was rated the most liberal member of the Senate by GovTrack. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5370.0s)]
*  Well, why don't you answer Mark's question? It is. The question is, what does she really stand for? [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5375.120000000001s)]
*  No, no. He asked you about JD Vance. You ignored his question. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5378.8s)]
*  Sorry. What's your question? I'm happy to answer it. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5381.92s)]
*  Would JD Vance ever go against Donald Trump? No. Obviously, I understand that a VP cannot go [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5383.68s)]
*  against what the president wants. Thank you. That's it in a nutshell. That's it. Period. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5390.320000000001s)]
*  End of story. Now we can cut half the episode out. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5392.72s)]
*  Now moving on. Hold on a second. That fact does not prove that Kamala Harris has a different policy [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5394.48s)]
*  than Joe Biden whenever it's inconvenient for you to admit that Biden's policy sucks. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5401.04s)]
*  No. You're doing the exact thing you're saying that I'm doing. You're trying to position her [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5406.0s)]
*  so that everything from the Biden administration is she has ownership of it. And what I'm saying [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5410.639999999999s)]
*  is just look at what she's doing. Look at what she's saying. See, here's the antithesis of the [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5415.679999999999s)]
*  Trump Dearrangement Syndrome. You tell whenever Donald Trump says something stupid, everybody [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5423.6s)]
*  explains it for him. When Kamala Harris says something smart, everybody tries to explain [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5429.120000000001s)]
*  why it's stupid and not true. When did she say something smart? I mean, seriously, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5434.0s)]
*  what was the last thing she said that was smart? Just curious. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5437.120000000001s)]
*  Jason, you want to fact check the window list? By the way, the window list thing, Mark, just so [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5440.8s)]
*  you know, because Nick shared it with us, it's an architectural digest article. Apparently, Eric Adams, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5445.76s)]
*  the mayor of New York, proposed windowless bedrooms as a way to change the building codes to [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5451.68s)]
*  incentivize more apartments being built to fix the housing crisis. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5458.08s)]
*  Converting the problem with converting the plates in commercial. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5461.84s)]
*  This is the gaslighting. They try to make Trump seem crazy. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5466.08s)]
*  Well, I mean, Trump lies constantly. Let's be honest. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5468.72s)]
*  Then you fact check. Then you find out that there's a real basis to his comments. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5470.56s)]
*  Then in some cases, he just lies. Anyway. Trump can't ever explain it himself. Why is it that [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5473.280000000001s)]
*  the guy that you like can never come out and say, Hey, you know, this is crazy. This is the most [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5478.32s)]
*  ridiculous thing. Eric Adams suggested everybody else has got to do the research and explain what [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5482.799999999999s)]
*  Trump really means because he is losing it. He is cognitively incapable. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5487.759999999999s)]
*  You believe he's incognito for client sex? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5492.08s)]
*  No, I think he's very sharp. We met him personally. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5498.32s)]
*  So let's wrap the politics section with just a final question because- [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5500.48s)]
*  No, wait, I have a question. Yeah, let's leave politics. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5504.96s)]
*  Mark, very pointed question. Why did you sell the MAVs? [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5506.88s)]
*  At this moment? So I sold three quarters of them, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5512.56s)]
*  not the whole thing. I still own 27.7% for a couple of reasons. One, when I first bought in in 2000, [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5514.64s)]
*  I was the tech guy in the NBA. I was the media guy. Broadcast.com just sold it. HDNet just created [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5523.12s)]
*  the very first ever high definition television network. I had every edge in every angle. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5530.16s)]
*  Now, fast forward 24 years later, in order to sustain growth, to be able to compete with the [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5535.92s)]
*  new collective bargaining agreement, you have to have other sources of revenue. And so you see [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5542.56s)]
*  other teams and all sports for that matter, talking about casinos, talking about creating, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5548.0s)]
*  doing real estate development, hotel. That's just not me. I wasn't going to put up $2 billion [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5553.52s)]
*  to get an education on building. Same. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5559.68s)]
*  So that was one. That's part one. Part two is my kids are now 15, 18 and 21. And over the next [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5562.400000000001s)]
*  10 years, that's a lot of pressure on them to have to take over the team or deal with the trust. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5570.08s)]
*  God forbid something happens to me, deal with the trust fund issues. And so by selling three [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5576.400000000001s)]
*  quarters of it, I took all that pressure off of them. Because you guys see the hate. I mean, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5581.12s)]
*  Jason can tell you all day long about Jimmy Dolan. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5586.24s)]
*  You know, he's MIA right now and the Knicks are doing great. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5589.04s)]
*  Do you think valuations peak Mark? I don't think they've peaked yet because [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5592.5599999999995s)]
*  for the reasons I just mentioned, if we're able to build a Venetian type casino in Dallas with [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5598.48s)]
*  an American Airlines Center in the middle of it, the valuation is $20 billion. But I own 27% of that. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5606.0s)]
*  Well, and you bought it for under 300 and 3.5. Not everybody's keeping the records. I think [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5612.96s)]
*  Chamath, you bought a 300 and sold at 3 billion as well. So congratulations, boys. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5619.2s)]
*  Actually, let me ask you a question about that. When you did it, did you just do it for fun and [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5622.88s)]
*  it worked out to be a great business or did you think it's going to be a great business? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5626.16s)]
*  No, I did it for fun. So, you know, this is a great question, David. From 2000 to 2010, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5628.88s)]
*  the actual valuations went down. And in 2010, we were not even able to sell the New Orleans Hornets. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5635.84s)]
*  The league had to buy it. Right. And it was right around then that the Sixers got purchased for [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5643.68s)]
*  200 for the same price I paid. And, you know, the cap, the NBA salary cap is a reflection of [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5649.2s)]
*  the total revenues of the NBA. There were multiple years when the salary cap went down, meaning our [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5656.4800000000005s)]
*  overall revenues went down, which was great for me competitively because I would buy first round [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5662.56s)]
*  picks for 3 million dollars. I would buy players from other teams that couldn't afford to run their [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5667.76s)]
*  teams. And that's why we went on this, you know, 15 year streak of never having a losing season and [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5672.88s)]
*  winning 50 games in a row for 10 years in a row. So, you know, it worked against me, worked for [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5678.160000000001s)]
*  me competitively, but that just shows you that things can change. And so I did do what's that? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5684.320000000001s)]
*  What TV deal? So when cable and satellite and over the air became very competitive [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5690.08s)]
*  and they started to grow and subscriptions grew to 130 million people or subscriptions, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5697.44s)]
*  that's a lot of money. And they had to compete for content so that there would be less churn. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5703.92s)]
*  And I literally remember in 2001, when we first signed our first cable deal, NBC had the deal and [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5709.44s)]
*  they were going back to David Stern saying we need fewer games. And I sat there in one of our [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5717.36s)]
*  board of governors meetings and I'm like, look, TBS just signed a deal to pay a billion dollars [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5722.0s)]
*  per episode for repeats of Seinfeld. If you do that on evaluation per hour, ours is fresher, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5728.16s)]
*  our ratings are actually better. Don't think of it as less product will lead to more demand. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5734.88s)]
*  It's the exact opposite. We're so inexpensive, we can charge more. And that led to the next TV [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5743.12s)]
*  deal and that led to the explosion. Mark, you have a lot of fingers and a lot of pots in other [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5748.8s)]
*  businesses. You have a really important thing you're doing in drugs that you may want to talk [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5753.36s)]
*  about. Yeah, thanks for bringing that up. If you look at the next 10 years of your life, so you're [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5757.2s)]
*  66 between now, 14 years between now and 80, 81. What's your goal? Like, what are you working on? [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5762.08s)]
*  What are the things that you care about? Where are you putting your capital? What are you trying to [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5769.12s)]
*  do? The number one's family, obviously, but beyond that is CosmosDrugs.com. We're f***ing up the health [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5772.4s)]
*  industry like you wouldn't believe. If you've seen- Just explain it for the folks that don't understand. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5778.96s)]
*  So let's just say guys our age or you guys are close enough to my age, we use [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5783.28s)]
*  a drug called Tadilafil, for those of you who know what it is. And it's generic Cialis. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5788.48s)]
*  Cialis is great. Cialis is great. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5794.5599999999995s)]
*  Viagra sucks. Cialis is way better. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. We gotta double click on this. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5797.36s)]
*  Or so I've heard from Saks. So you've heard from Saks. Are you a Cialis or a Viagra guy, Saks? What's [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5801.5199999999995s)]
*  going on here? Or both? Cialis just seems better value for money. What are those? Never heard of [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5806.719999999999s)]
*  them. Saks is like, what is that? Never heard of them. He's turning red actually. So if you go to [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5815.44s)]
*  CosmosDrugs.com and you put in Tadilafil, when it comes up, we show you our actual cost. And [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5820.719999999999s)]
*  then we mark it up by 15%. And if you buy it via mail order, then we add $5 for a pharmacy fee to [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5827.12s)]
*  review everything and $5 for shipping and handling. The net result of that is you guys have a general [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5833.28s)]
*  idea of what the price is now from all the ads. You can buy a 90 pack of Tadilafil for about $9.90 [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5839.04s)]
*  plus shipping and handling. So for less than the price of a bag of M&Ms, you could put up a little [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5847.2s)]
*  cup or jar next to your bed of either M&Ms. What is the name of this website? CosmosDrugs.com. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5853.2s)]
*  Chumup be right back. $9 for 90 days. Right? We're like, let's go. Poor Chumup. That seems free. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5859.28s)]
*  It's an incredible deal. But you apply that to the 2,500 drugs that we have. And now all of a sudden, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5869.2s)]
*  you see what's wrong with these things called pharmacy benefit managers and the problem of an [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5875.44s)]
*  industry that's opaque. And I'll give you another example. There are drugs that are called specialty [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5880.08s)]
*  generics. And the only thing special about them, they're actually just pills, is that they were [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5884.5599999999995s)]
*  traditionally more expensive. So there's a drug called Imatinib, which is a chemotherapy drug. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5889.5199999999995s)]
*  If you just walk into a CVS as an example, a big, big pharmacy, and you're a cash payer or a high [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5895.04s)]
*  deductible payer and you just needed it, they'll charge you anywhere from $200 to $2,000. You have [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5904.48s)]
*  no idea what you're going to pay. If you get it from CosmosDrugs, depending on the number and the [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5909.6s)]
*  strength, it might be $21 to $30. There's another drug, Droxodopa. One of my buddies came to me and [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5913.92s)]
*  said, I'm losing my insurance. They want to charge me, the pharmacy wants to charge me $10,000 a quarter [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5919.200000000001s)]
*  for this medication called Droxodopa. All right, Landon, let me check. Initially it was $64 a month. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5925.200000000001s)]
*  Now it's in the $20 per month because as our cost goes down, we pass it on. And that's just changed [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5930.8s)]
*  the industry because think about what happens when you get a prescription. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5936.48s)]
*  What's the pushback? But Mark, I mean, what is the pushback you get? Because that's [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5939.759999999999s)]
*  that's- None. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5944.16s)]
*  It's counter to the trend, right? So is it just infinite growth or how does the industry respond [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5945.919999999999s)]
*  when you create that price differential? So it's the innovator's dilemma. They can't just give up [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5951.2s)]
*  all of this margin. So most of the business of pharmacy benefit management, not most, so a big [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5956.639999999999s)]
*  chunk of the businesses comes from corporate, from corporations, right? And self-insured companies. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5962.56s)]
*  And they go to them and they put together the thing called the formulary, which is all the drugs, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5968.4800000000005s)]
*  right? That's available to them. And they say, we're going to price this so that we get rebates and [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5972.64s)]
*  we'll pass on the rebates we get from the manufacturers to you. Now they say they're [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5978.0s)]
*  going to pass on 100% of that rebate. They don't. They create all these subsidiaries and everything [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5982.080000000001s)]
*  that's skim 10% or whatever off the top. But they know that they can continue working with these [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5986.8s)]
*  companies because the core competency of a CEO is not to know their healthcare costs. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5991.92s)]
*  And literally for any CEOs that are out there, audit your PBM contract. Audit it right now. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=5996.64s)]
*  I promise you that that PBM is going to tell you, you don't need to audit. And then you can say, [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6003.28s)]
*  we want to add cost plus drugs to our pharmacy supply contract. And they're going to say, no, [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6008.56s)]
*  you're not allowed to do it because they know our prices are so much lower that is disrupting their [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6013.4400000000005s)]
*  industry. Are you doing this as like a for profit business? Are you losing money on this and doing [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6019.28s)]
*  it just to help society? What's your plan here? Right now? I'm losing money. And most of that was [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6023.5199999999995s)]
*  because we build a factory, the whole robotics driven factory that manufacturers sterile [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6029.28s)]
*  injectables that are in short supply. So now like with the hurricane, you know, we're using our [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6035.44s)]
*  robotics to switch over to sterile water of all things and some other things so that we can [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6040.48s)]
*  manufacture it and get it to them at a reasonable price as opposed to price galgene, which Kamala has [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6044.72s)]
*  talked often about. So, you know, because there will be price galgene in pharmacy and we're here [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6051.4400000000005s)]
*  to be an alternative. So to answer your question, I've spent a whole lot of money on these robotics [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6056.4800000000005s)]
*  and putting this together, but our path is hockey stick, double, triple hockey stick. And so we're [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6061.68s)]
*  taking business from them. And I think the traditional legacy companies and the insurance- [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6068.0s)]
*  Did something happen to you or somebody around you that motivated you to go after the PBMs or [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6073.28s)]
*  with just his clinical business analysis of like, this just doesn't make sense and it can be done [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6078.639999999999s)]
*  better? So both. What happened was I got an email from my partner, co-founder, Dr. Alex Oszmajanski. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6083.12s)]
*  And he wanted to create a compounding pharmacy in Denver that made drugs that were in short supply, [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6089.679999999999s)]
*  because there's always for whatever reason, some generic drug that is on a shortage list. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6095.5199999999995s)]
*  And I'm like, you're thinking too small. And this was right around the time that the farmer bro was [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6099.84s)]
*  going to jail. And I asked him, you know, how is it that this dude buys up a one-year supply of [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6104.8s)]
*  Daraprim, the drug he bought, and just jacks it up? And how does that happen? And he goes, [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6110.0s)]
*  it just happened. I'm like, well, let me do some homework and dig in. And the reason was obvious. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6115.360000000001s)]
*  The industry was completely opaque. The first line in every single pharmacy contract and [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6120.4800000000005s)]
*  healthcare contract for that matter is you're not allowed to talk about it. You are restricted from [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6125.04s)]
*  talking about this to anybody, anybody at all. So we had a completely opaque market. So we put [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6130.0s)]
*  together the website called costplusdrugs.com. But really the smartest thing that we did, and it was [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6135.92s)]
*  unintentional in terms of impact, we created a full price list. So you can get our 2,500 drugs, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6141.36s)]
*  the actual price list, and we release it every week because we're on a roll now where we've had [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6148.0s)]
*  since last a year ago, more than a year ago, every weekday we've lowered a price on a drug. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6153.52s)]
*  And so we just put that out. And what's happened as a result is now companies can just get the [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6158.160000000001s)]
*  price list and do comparisons to approximately what they're paying because their PBM won't [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6162.56s)]
*  tell them exactly what they're paying. I have one suggestion for you there, Mark. You can make this [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6167.360000000001s)]
*  a nonprofit. When you sell the MAVs, you could donate money to this. Then like six, seven years [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6172.080000000001s)]
*  later, you could flip it into a for-profit and take it public. There's like a strategy here. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6177.4400000000005s)]
*  This could work out really well for you. Exactly the point. And Sam Altman isn't an [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6182.8s)]
*  investor. No, I'm just kidding. And so we put out this price list and all of a sudden Harvard Medical [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6187.6s)]
*  and Vanderbilt and all these research institutes took our pricing and compared it to what Medicare [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6195.84s)]
*  was paying for the same drugs. And it was like, well, if Medicare- [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6203.52s)]
*  This is what I was going to ask you because CMS is now empowered to negotiate. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6206.8s)]
*  Yeah. And this is sort of maybe ties together with the governmental efficiency and just do [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6210.8s)]
*  the obvious right thing, but shouldn't they just work with you as an example? And why don't they? [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6215.76s)]
*  They are. And it's just started. They are. Right. So here again, I can't speak for her to say what [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6223.360000000001s)]
*  she's going to do, but here was the conversation I've had with her team. When it comes to reducing [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6228.72s)]
*  out-of-pocket costs to deal with inflation, what I have told them is one key area that [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6234.96s)]
*  impacts most families at some level, nobody dies healthy, is the cost of healthcare and [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6242.32s)]
*  pharmaceuticals. And by working, by requiring transparency in all contracts signed by anybody [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6246.64s)]
*  anywhere in terms of pricing, you are going to see the same impact on across the board pricing [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6253.36s)]
*  of a decrease of 30, 40%. And so all of that is going to reduce out-of-pocket spending for everybody, [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6258.64s)]
*  reduce government spending for everybody, and have a net positive impact. They see that- [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6265.6s)]
*  And have you had that conversation with the Republicans as well so that they- [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6270.240000000001s)]
*  No. I mean- [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6274.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, it seems it makes sense for everybody. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6274.64s)]
*  I had a similar conversation, like as I mentioned to you in the White House, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6276.96s)]
*  when I went there and it just didn't resonate. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6280.8s)]
*  Boys, any final questions for Mark here as we wrap up? [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6283.200000000001s)]
*  You're not going to ask me about Elon and Y-Troll Elon and any of that good stuff? [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6285.84s)]
*  Well, I want to know about, are you investing in AI technology? Where are you investing in the stack? [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6288.72s)]
*  How do you think about that? Are you an active venture investor, Mark? I mean, [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6295.68s)]
*  I know we've obviously done some stuff together, but I'm curious how you look at stuff. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6298.4800000000005s)]
*  So now I've kind of slowed down. I invested in Grok with Schmott, right? Schmott said, [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6302.16s)]
*  yeah, let's go, right? And he can tell you all the reasons. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6306.32s)]
*  I think we all have a piece of that now. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6308.72s)]
*  Okay, well good. So you guys know the whole story, right? And so I think that's great. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6310.88s)]
*  Picks and shovels, I think are important. I think the problem, and this happens with all new [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6314.56s)]
*  technologies, is we're seeing the gold rush right now where everybody calls everything AI, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6318.320000000001s)]
*  particularly with agents. And I think you can put all these vertical agents together to do all these [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6323.280000000001s)]
*  different things, but agents are just going to be a feature, not a product. Because inherently, [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6329.360000000001s)]
*  an AI, as it advances and gets smarter, then it's going to be able to create its own agents for its [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6334.080000000001s)]
*  users and go forward from there. So I've been really hesitant now because you're not going to [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6339.52s)]
*  invest in the foundational models. I mean, through a fund, I have part of OpenAI and some others, but [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6345.84s)]
*  that's just so expensive. You don't know who the winners are going to be. But yet everything that [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6353.68s)]
*  happens is going to be a derivative of them. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6359.120000000001s)]
*  What's your business intuition tell you about that, actually? So you have this crazy capital [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6361.120000000001s)]
*  race between closed and open. How do you think that plays out? [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6365.44s)]
*  I think there are going to be tens of millions of models. Everybody's going to have a model. Your [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6370.16s)]
*  kids are going to have models. Their little invisible friend is going to be a model that's [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6376.16s)]
*  a teddy bear that they grow up with. So there's going to be an unlimited number of models. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6382.24s)]
*  But we don't know who the winners are going to be to host those models. I have no idea. And if you [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6386.799999999999s)]
*  go back over the history of technology, that's always the case. There's always a race to be the [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6393.44s)]
*  winner for the foundation, whether it was broadband, whether it was networking, whatever it's streaming, [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6399.919999999999s)]
*  and everybody battles it out. And so it's okay. And for me now, I'm just like, let me just wait. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6405.2s)]
*  You think there's going to be a chance at job displacement? What do you think of this universal [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6412.639999999999s)]
*  basic income cataclysm? I think it's the exact opposite. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6418.16s)]
*  Okay, I explained. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6421.36s)]
*  So I think that in order to train a model, you need access to information. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6422.5599999999995s)]
*  And the internet ain't what it used to be in terms of being a source of information. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6429.2s)]
*  And so IP is becoming more valuable. I think everybody by this time expected [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6434.08s)]
*  all the foundational models to have all this healthcare information. But if I'm Mayo Clinic, [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6440.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm not giving Microsoft or Google or OpenAI my IP because that's what brands me. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6445.6s)]
*  And so there's going to be a lot of money available there. And I think that there's [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6452.160000000001s)]
*  got to be a way to figure that out. First, how does IP work and how is it distributed? [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6460.320000000001s)]
*  And then how are we using it just in general? We really don't know how we're going to implement [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6465.76s)]
*  it or use it or what the interface is going to be. And all that will be figured out by some [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6471.6s)]
*  kid somewhere. So maybe just to wrap, Mark. So these next 100 or 15 years, is it about doubling [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6475.36s)]
*  down on these current things, making cost plus thing huge, like harvesting essentially, or [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6480.32s)]
*  are you going to do new things or is just the bar getting higher? [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6486.799999999999s)]
*  When I'm gone, I wanted to say, motherfucker, he did it. It was expensive when we were sick [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6490.32s)]
*  and inexpensive no more. And to me, that's the ultimate mission. Now, it's fun to learn AI and [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6496.32s)]
*  build models and do all that stuff, right. But when it's all said and done, to me, that's where [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6503.44s)]
*  you want to mark. That's what I want to say. Let me ask you a final final question, then. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6509.04s)]
*  We've you've done a reality show just retired from that cashed out of three quarters of the Mavericks [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6513.759999999999s)]
*  check did that helping people with this cost plus drugs and saving people money. It's a pretty [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6520.24s)]
*  noble mission kind of adds up to you're going to run for president. No, there's no way. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6528.08s)]
*  It would be a great thing to do. You've checked off all the boxes. Why wouldn't you? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6534.24s)]
*  He's too old now. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6537.12s)]
*  Too old now, right? [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6537.599999999999s)]
*  He's not. What are you talking about? He's 20 years younger than Trump and Biden. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6538.16s)]
*  Wikipedia is wrong. I changed. I'm a sock puppet in my spare time. I changed. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6542.0s)]
*  No, four years from now, eight years from now, would you even consider it or if you were going [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6545.759999999999s)]
*  to consider it? Yeah, right. Yeah. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6549.759999999999s)]
*  How would you process making that decision? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6552.96s)]
*  My kids hated the idea. My wife hated the idea. They want, you know, it's hard enough for them to [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6554.799999999999s)]
*  have a normal life as it is. And that just takes it to a whole another level. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6559.28s)]
*  Plus you'd have to run as a Republican because Democrats hate billionaires like you. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6563.44s)]
*  No, actually. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6567.44s)]
*  You saw it happen in Bloomberg, right? You saw it happen in Bloomberg. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6568.0s)]
*  Yeah, but that's a shame. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6570.16s)]
*  But $100 million made it to the first question of the first debate. Boom. Elizabeth Warren [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6571.12s)]
*  knocked him out. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6575.12s)]
*  But let me just tell you this and we don't have to talk more about politics. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6576.08s)]
*  Parties don't exist anymore. They don't. There's fundraising vehicles and they have procedures in [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6579.04s)]
*  place. But this is Donald Trump. He took over the Republican Party. They do what he says. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6585.92s)]
*  And Kamala Harris has learned from Donald Trump. Give him credit. She has learned what worked for [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6591.36s)]
*  him. They're not stupid. She has learned that she has got to be that personality that takes over. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6596.24s)]
*  And they've got to do what she says. You haven't heard a word from Bernie or Elizabeth Warren. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6601.28s)]
*  And that's not unintentional. She is doing it her way. Now, whether or not you agree what she's [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6606.24s)]
*  doing or her approach to win, everybody can argue and that's what makes a market. But there are no [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6610.88s)]
*  political parties anymore. And the idea of the ideology of a party on the Democratic side is no [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6615.84s)]
*  more in place than on the Republican side. All right. So with that, my Nick's got a shot this [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6621.68s)]
*  year. What do you think? Yeah, I thought the trade was great. I thought that trade was great. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6627.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's great. I mean, he's a little weak on the defense, but he's. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6631.360000000001s)]
*  But with KP, right, that's what they're doing. How do they match up with Boston? [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6637.360000000001s)]
*  And so KP and Kat match up and that's what we got a shot. You're saying there's a chance. [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6640.8s)]
*  My next might get there. I'm saying you and Jim Carrey have a lot in common. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6646.0s)]
*  There's a chance. All right, everybody. This has been another amazing episode. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6649.84s)]
*  Thanks guys. Come back anytime. Mark. And we'll see you all next time. Bye bye. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6654.88s)]
*  Thanks. That was awesome. They'll give you instructions on that. And I'll see you at a [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6659.040000000001s)]
*  game soon. Yeah, you guys are awesome. Cheers. And I don't mind arguing data. I love to argue [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6662.64s)]
*  this stuff. Right? I know. I know. Look, I give you credit. You're fun to talk with and argue with. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6667.68s)]
*  And you obviously don't take it personally. And I appreciate that. And yeah, I give you credit [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6672.24s)]
*  for having fun with it. I know too many depressed billionaires. So I give you a lot of credit. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6677.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't get that. But you know what? If you were if you were when you were poor, you're up when [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6683.84s)]
*  you're rich. Right. And it just doesn't change anything. I was hoping you could. We talked about [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6687.599999999999s)]
*  Elon. Well, we could still go there. Where's Jake? We can still go there. You can ask the question. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6692.16s)]
*  All right. Two of my besties, the last 25 years, you and Elon, is this you guys just goofing on [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6697.12s)]
*  each other? You got an issue with Elon that's sincere? Or is it just playful, fun trolling? [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6705.44s)]
*  So two things. One, as an entrepreneur, Elon's like the shit of the shit of the shit. Right? [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6711.2s)]
*  Yeah, there's I'm a huge fan. What he's been able to accomplish is insane. It's incredible. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6717.2s)]
*  I would never diminish anything he's done as an entrepreneur. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6723.68s)]
*  As a Twitter user, he's a troll. And I mean, he just trolls to troll to troll. And every good troll [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6726.8s)]
*  deserves a foil, right? Somebody to troll back. And it's just so easy and so much fun. Now, you [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6735.52s)]
*  know, I get some of the underlying principles, I think, at least in my mind, like when he talks [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6742.0s)]
*  about the First Amendment principle that he's doing here of like radically changing Twitter from [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6745.52s)]
*  like, it's pretty controlled to, hey, anything goes. I think that's a fear of losing users. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6751.68s)]
*  So I think that within the conservative community, they are more joiners and heavier [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6759.68s)]
*  social media users. Participants. Yeah, participants. So they subscribe to more things. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6769.2s)]
*  They listen to more podcasts. They're more active. And I think he recognized that. And that was a [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6774.96s)]
*  fundamental underpinning of why he kind of connected to them on the free speech thing, [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6781.44s)]
*  because he still has its limits. Obviously, it's his platform. And what he doesn't want [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6787.84s)]
*  doesn't get shown. So I think that's why and I can't blame him. I wish he would call me, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6792.24s)]
*  I'd help him on his revenue and all that. And then I think on the immigration side, [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6797.6s)]
*  here's my theory. You guys can tell me if you agree or disagree. I don't think he's anti-immigration [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6803.120000000001s)]
*  like he says, you know, anti-illegal immigration, where anybody who's in the country should be [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6809.76s)]
*  deported. I think as an immigrant himself, and I'm second generation, you guys are, you know, [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6815.280000000001s)]
*  immigrants at some level, we all are. But I think as an immigrant himself, he thinks that the number [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6820.88s)]
*  of illegal immigrants in this country and the hate that's pushed towards them [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6826.48s)]
*  carries over to legal immigrants, including himself. And I think he believes that by diminishing [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6833.12s)]
*  the illegal or the non-citizens in this country and asking for their removal, it improves the [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6841.759999999999s)]
*  standing of the legal immigrants, including himself. And so that's kind of my theory on both [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6847.839999999999s)]
*  of those things. Interesting. Yeah. It's certainly a different place. I don't think you need much of [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6853.6s)]
*  a theory to explain Elon's views because he's just so transparent about what he believes. I truly [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6859.92s)]
*  believe that his core conviction and the reason he bought Twitter X is because he wanted to unlock [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6864.160000000001s)]
*  it as a free speech platform. Yeah, I don't think so. I don't know how much more money he can lose [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6871.76s)]
*  in pursuit of that goal. But see, here's why I disagree. You don't take other people's money [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6877.52s)]
*  to do that. Well, I don't think he knew. He didn't know that he would get boycotted by all these [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6882.48s)]
*  advertisers. Yeah, but he knew that. I think he went in, open eyes, carried the sink in the door [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6888.32s)]
*  to run it with some improvements operationally, which he did a great job of. And taking out a [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6895.759999999999s)]
*  huge amount of the cost structure, which he did. Jason and I were there on the first day. The first [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6902.0s)]
*  day he took over, there was an organized boycott of advertisers. They called him anti-Semitic, [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6906.24s)]
*  which is ridiculous. Before he even had a chance to do one thing about that site. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6911.28s)]
*  So I've heard from a lot of those folks. And it's not so much. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6916.4s)]
*  When you talk about free speech, free speech applies to advertisers as well. They get to [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6922.88s)]
*  associate with whoever they want to, no matter what. So there are repercussions. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6927.12s)]
*  Unless there's a collusive effort going on to sort of organize those advertisers. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6932.88s)]
*  I get that organization dissolved immediately. But look, from my own self, right? [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6938.0s)]
*  I don't understand why you won't give him credit for believing in free speech. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6943.68s)]
*  That's clearly the principle. I have no problem with free speech. Look, I've always said, [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6946.400000000001s)]
*  people like get rid of the anti-Semitic people. You get anti-Semitic tropes. I get zillions of [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6950.32s)]
*  anti-Semitic tropes in my replies. Just they're nonstop. I mean, I'm not white. My grandparents [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6955.4400000000005s)]
*  changed their name from Chibisky to Cuban, not even intentionally. And so it's always your real [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6962.88s)]
*  name is Chibisky White. It's just the hate there is insane. And my attitude has always been, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6967.52s)]
*  I want to know who the morons are. I have no problem with them still being allowed on the [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6972.24s)]
*  platform. But the trade-off is for advertisers. They don't want to be associated with that. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6977.2s)]
*  There is no upside for being on Twitter right now or Exxon right now. And you add to that the porn. [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6982.88s)]
*  Kids 13 years old can go on that site and you can find any insane thing you want on Exxon right now. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6989.360000000001s)]
*  And that also is a problem for advertisers. That's part of free speech, but you got to pay the bill [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=6997.120000000001s)]
*  when you're willing to accept that. I don't think he realized just how deep users will go [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7003.200000000001s)]
*  in order to use their free speech. And I think that really surprised him. And so that's why I [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7008.88s)]
*  don't think that he bought it specifically for free speech because I think he's always, [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7013.92s)]
*  one of the things I really admire. I don't know. I mean, he said before he bought it, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7019.12s)]
*  that he was going to open it up as a free speech platform. And that's why, hold on. This is why the [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7022.96s)]
*  left immediately started boycotting him before he even changed one policy. Jake, help me out. You [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7027.12s)]
*  were there the first freaking day. I know for a fact that this was a free speech mission for him. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7032.56s)]
*  I do think, you know, multiple things can be true. Mark, you are correct that if you have spicy [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7038.08s)]
*  content, advertisers don't want anything to do with it and they have choices. And it's also one [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7043.919999999999s)]
*  of the smaller platforms that have choices that have more scale. So that makes it even easier. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7048.96s)]
*  And it's also true that they're boycotting him and specifically targeting, but all these things are [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7052.799999999999s)]
*  happening at the same time. And I think, you know, when you look at what he's done there, [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7057.599999999999s)]
*  we'll look at it historically, as this place that was very controlled and clean and owned by the [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7062.56s)]
*  press and the elites became this chaotic thing, but also ultimately the one place where at scale, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7070.160000000001s)]
*  you cannot be canceled. And you know, if you look at cancellation as a concept, [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7078.56s)]
*  the number one place to get canceled was Twitter. You said something even slightly off, man, they [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7083.4400000000005s)]
*  came down on you, they destroyed you. And now that we've gotten rid of cancel culture and [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7088.24s)]
*  people can say what they believe and people can make the mistake. I do think that that will be [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7092.8s)]
*  looked at as a beautiful thing that he gave to society as a gift. And it will be looked at as a [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7101.2s)]
*  really challenged business because it was an ad business that lost its advertising base and Apple [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7105.599999999999s)]
*  and Disney have choices. I don't see the need here to look past or to look for an ulterior motive. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7110.8s)]
*  And what Elon's doing, Elon believes in free speech. It's very clear. He's run the platform [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7117.5199999999995s)]
*  that way and it's cost him money. So what else could the motivation be except his principles? [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7121.919999999999s)]
*  Obviously, but he was also addicted to it. I can tell you that as the person who got him, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7127.36s)]
*  I know, but that's not, that's not why he's running. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7131.2s)]
*  He loves it. [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7133.12s)]
*  Let me give you my calendar to that. You know, better than I do. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7136.08s)]
*  Why are we even having this debate? Who cares? I mean, I'm just sure. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7138.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, as a free speech platform. Yeah. And that's fine. Obviously it's his choice. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7143.04s)]
*  That's free speech by definition. Actually, to me, this debate is kind of pointless, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7147.04s)]
*  but let's talk about actually the issue. There's a new story this week where OpenAI just raised [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7151.68s)]
*  was a 6 billion. Yeah. And 150 billion valuation. They originally started that enterprise with 50 [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7157.92s)]
*  million or so from Elon. It was a nonprofit. Then they became a for-profit. Now there's a [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7166.32s)]
*  report saying that they're telling investors in this round that they can't invest in any other [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7172.56s)]
*  AI companies. So they're acting like, I mean, they've gone from nonprofit philanthropy to [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7178.160000000001s)]
*  piranha for-profit company. That's pretty sharp. Yeah. Sharp. Elbow. Sam said he wasn't going to [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7182.96s)]
*  take compensation. Now he's getting compensation. Yep. 10 billion. I mean, what do you think about [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7188.96s)]
*  this? I mean, look, it's their company. They get to do what they want. Period. False pretenses. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7193.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, but don't invest. I mean, he didn't invest. He gave him a donation. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7200.48s)]
*  No, look, which leads to something I want to say very positive about Elon. Put aside his genius [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7205.679999999999s)]
*  in coming up and running these companies. The one thing I respect the most about Elon Musk, [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7210.48s)]
*  and he does more than anybody I've ever seen, and that is he goes all in. He doesn't just, [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7217.12s)]
*  he takes every cent he has and he believes in it and he goes all motherf*****g in. He never hedges [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7223.92s)]
*  his bet at all. Until Twitter. That's why I say he brought in investors to Tesla and everything, [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7231.200000000001s)]
*  but initially he went all in himself. I think with Twitter, I think he was kind of surprised. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7239.280000000001s)]
*  But going back to open AI, I wouldn't do business with people like that. And there are people who [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7244.4800000000005s)]
*  just look for what they think is the next big thing. And I certainly could have given him money, [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7250.4s)]
*  didn't give him money. I said one of our funds that I'm in gave, did give him money originally, [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7256.16s)]
*  didn't give him money another time. To me, that's just wrong. And that catches up to you. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7260.0s)]
*  When people f*****g over investors and whatever, it always comes back. Karma is a b**ch in business [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7264.48s)]
*  too. Now, you know, Gemini with Google, I've done a lot of stuff with them. Notebook is insanely [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7270.24s)]
*  good. Gemini 1.5 is insanely good. Meta as open source and what they're doing is getting better [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7277.04s)]
*  and better. There's nothing that says that open AI is going to win. Nothing at all. And so I don't [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7283.12s)]
*  feel bad about what they're doing. And to me, it tells me they're more scared than anything by [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7292.0s)]
*  trying to restrict what people are doing. Yep. That's a super offensive claim. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7297.5199999999995s)]
*  It says it's more a reflection of Sam than anything else is what you're saying. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7302.0s)]
*  Yep. Well, I mean, that would be reflected in the fact that so many people who are the [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7308.0s)]
*  co-founders have left. That's a really big red flag. If this thing is going to change the world, [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7311.92s)]
*  all the co-founders leave. I heard 40 of the 44 co-founders left. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7318.4s)]
*  Yeah. The original employees. I mean, I don't know if that's true, but that's bonkers. And then if you [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7322.4s)]
*  Well, I mean, if you also think about this business Chamath and where it's headed, [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7326.799999999999s)]
*  sorry, there were 44 co-founders. No, I was f***ing around the Donald Trump cabinet members thing. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7330.16s)]
*  Yeah. No, but I mean, if you, if you, we, we, we did a joke about it last week, but if you just look [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7335.36s)]
*  at the, the competition set that they're up against, they're losing 5 billion a year, they're making [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7341.28s)]
*  three and a half. They put this thing at 150 billion. It's 40 times, 50 times revenue to [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7346.639999999999s)]
*  fill in that valuation on a price to sales basis. You know, it's kind of crazy. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7352.88s)]
*  Here's the one thing that I'll say. And I think Mark said this in a different way, but I'll just, [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7357.12s)]
*  I don't think you can underestimate how companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Amazon [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7362.8s)]
*  will react when they feel cornered. And I think in, in the last 20 to 25 years, what you've seen is [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7371.68s)]
*  those companies, when their backs are against the wall, they use money, their sharp elbowed, [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7378.88s)]
*  but the consistent thing is they've won. And so the real question is, do people look at the chart [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7383.6s)]
*  of the users? Because typically what happens is it's users, what tilts these companies, [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7388.88s)]
*  when something, some upstart, you remember when Snapchat was about to explode? Yeah. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7393.76s)]
*  There was a decision we're going to decapitate this company. Facebook effectively did that. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7398.32s)]
*  They relegated it to the corner. Zynga. Yep. Zynga. There's many examples. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7402.64s)]
*  So the real question is when they see that this app is going to be at three or 500 million Mao, [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7407.52s)]
*  and they appear on some list where they're bigger than, I don't know, pick your favorite [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7414.160000000001s)]
*  app inside of meta. Yeah. Will they freak out? And if they do freak out, what do they do? [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7419.120000000001s)]
*  Oh, I can tell you they're freaking right now. Oh yeah. It's an, it's an existential risk to them. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7424.400000000001s)]
*  Right. And the crazy, I mean, look what Microsoft did. They bought three mile island, the nuclear [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7429.040000000001s)]
*  reactor. They bought it. Everybody's looking for the angle and the crazy part is- It's really crazy. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7435.68s)]
*  Yes. There used to be Moore's law that everything followed right. The price performance curve always [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7441.52s)]
*  went like this, you know, and power goes up now because you don't know. You don't know what you [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7445.76s)]
*  don't know and what you need to do next. That's part of the challenge that Elon has with Tesla [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7451.04s)]
*  in terms of full service driving. You don't know what you need to do next to get there to solve [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7456.16s)]
*  Do you have a Tesla Mark? I do. And I do also, I also have a Kia EV. I have a Tesla EV and I have [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7461.68s)]
*  a Kia EV. Do you use the FSD? And if so, how is it? I have, but I stopped using it just because it [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7467.2s)]
*  terrified me because it doesn't know what adversarial things that doesn't know. Cause you know, [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7473.2s)]
*  you know, anything that's adversarial that something that's to train on something that's seen, [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2YT_FwH0VM&t=7481.2s)]
