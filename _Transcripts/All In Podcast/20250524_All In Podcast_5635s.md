*  Do you think that that increases your salesmanship and effectiveness? I don't want to be getting grand pronouncements here [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=92.28s)]
*  But these have been important conversations. We've had it's been pretty great. I have [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=98.04s)]
*  No, it's just like they put like 18 things in the plugs now and I want to do too well [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  A modicum of work before you get on camera and actually edit here we go [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=108.24000000000001s)]

*  But this year will be no different we'll have incredible parties blah blah blah and let's get to work [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=131.52s)]
*  President a trip to the Middle East [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  For life deal with the Freiburg, okay [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=148.92000000000002s)]
*  All right, let's get to work here [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=167.68s)]
*  The bond market is the captain apparently Treasury Department sold 16 billion dollars worth of newly issued 20-year bonds on Wednesday afternoon [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  And there was weak demand this pushed yields higher across the board the 10-year which best and has said to focus on because it's the benchmark [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=177.44s)]
*  Rate for most borrowing costs, you know mortgages and stuff like that. It's spiked and here it is [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  And it actually hit a five handle at one point [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=190.32s)]
*  And the three major indices were all down between 1.5 and 2% on the day [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=192.48s)]
*  Obviously in related news the house passed the big beautiful bill at the 11th hour last night [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=197.92s)]
*  This makes the TCG JA tax cuts permanent [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=203.76s)]
*  And it's estimated to increase long-run GDP by 60 basis points [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=208.32s)]
*  That's the same as the S&P and the S&P dropped by 1.5 percent in about 30 minutes [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=212.48s)]
*  And it's estimated to increase long-run GDP by 60 basis points, uh, that's if all the cuts were implemented [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=217.92s)]
*  It's also going to reduce tax revenue by 4 trillion over 10 years is the estimate and it's going to add [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=224.8s)]
*  Between 3 and 5 trillion to the national debt over 10 years free break. What's your take on? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=230.16s)]
*  The triple b and the bond weak bond market all of it. I just want to take a quick primer on sure [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=236.16s)]
*  How the government gets funded I know we we assume everyone understands it but I think it's important for folks to really grok it [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=243.44s)]
*  For the federal government to make payments to employees and contractors and buy stuff [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=250.16s)]
*  They need to put money in their bank accounts and the way they put money in their bank accounts is they issue bonds [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=256.8s)]
*  These are treasury bonds. So they'll sell treasury bonds [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=261.44s)]
*  to the public and [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=265.68s)]
*  Individuals buy it companies buy it banks buy it and foreign governments buy us treasuries [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=267.74s)]
*  And they transfer or wire cash into the federal government's bank accounts, which they can then use to pay for stuff [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=272.56s)]
*  And then the treasury department needs to continuously sell treasuries to raise cash to fund the government when folks don't show up [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=279.44s)]
*  to buy treasuries [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=287.12s)]
*  That's a bad thing and that means that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=289.36s)]
*  the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=292.64s)]
*  Government needs to increase the interest rate that they're paying on those bonds. So what we saw on wednesday was a really weak [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=293.44s)]
*  Demand signal for treasuries on this, you know modest treasury auction selling 16 billion dollars of bonds is not a lot [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=300.72s)]
*  There's hundreds of billions being sold each quarter [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=308.72s)]
*  And so this was not a big number but there was no buyer [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=311.92s)]
*  The market was really dry [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=315.20000000000005s)]
*  And so everyone that participates in financial markets saw this and freaked out and the big motivation the big understanding of the relationship here is to your point [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=317.20000000000005s)]
*  That this big tax bill [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=324.72s)]
*  and spending bill [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  Is passing out of the house and that bill as we talked about last week [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=328.4s)]
*  Has a high deficit and that'll run up us debt over time [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=332.56s)]
*  Which makes it more difficult for the u.s government to pay its bills because it has to issue more debt [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=336.0s)]
*  Interest payments have to be paid every year and so on now if you just pull up this one slide [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=340.96s)]
*  This is something I thought was really worth sharing the cbo estimates, which is what you referenced jason [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=345.35999999999996s)]
*  are [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=350.32s)]
*  estimates of what the cost is going to be over time [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=351.35999999999996s)]
*  and this is from jessica [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=355.2s)]
*  Riedel or ridal out of the manhattan institute put this chart together congressional budget office [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=357.92s)]
*  Yeah, so the congressional budget office the cbo creates a estimate [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=369.68s)]
*  The budget the spending and the deficit and ultimately the incremental debt that the u.s government will need to issue to fund its obligations over time [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=370.48s)]
*  This is a chart that was put together that the expectation on a baseline basis is that over the next 30 years or so [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=379.04s)]
*  U.s debt to gdp will climb to 203 percent [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  But what a lot of people don't know and don't talk about is that in the cbo estimates they assume in all of their models [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=389.36s)]
*  That interest rates are at 3.6 percent [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=396.4s)]
*  And with the bond sell-off yesterday what we are now seeing is 30 year treasury interest rates [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=400.32s)]
*  At over 5 it's 5.1 percent this morning [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=407.2s)]
*  And for every incremental 1 above 3.6 [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=411.12s)]
*  You're spending an extra 350 billion a year in interest [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=415.76s)]
*  350 billion a year so as we go up by one and a half percent interest [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=419.9s)]
*  over the next 10 years [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=424.4s)]
*  We're spending another five trillion dollars just on interest payments half a billion dollars after trillion dollars a year of incremental interest on the difference between [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=426.32s)]
*  3.6 and 5.1 [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=435.03999999999996s)]
*  That's an incredible [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=437.28s)]
*  recursive problem and I say recursive [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  Because the incremental interest that we now have to pay because interest rates just went up [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=441.76s)]
*  Because the market is demanding more payments from the government to fund this means that the government has to issue more debt [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=446.23999999999995s)]
*  And it quickly gets away from you. There is a non [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=452.08s)]
*  Linear relationship between the deficit and interest rates which drives up the debt problem in a non-linear way [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=455.17999999999995s)]
*  And it gets away from you and you can't fix it and that's what the market is telling us is that the current bill [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  That's being passed out of the house is showing such an extraordinarily high deficit [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=467.2s)]
*  That the market does not want to buy the debt from the government rates are now climbing and that creates a massive problem for the government [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=472.0s)]
*  Okay, shamatha you've been tweeting about this [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=477.92s)]
*  We thought we were going to get an administration and maybe [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=483.12s)]
*  Some focus from the government that we would be having more austerity measures balance the budget now. It looks like we're going to pour [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=488.8s)]
*  Gasoline on the fire. What are your thoughts? I think we have to be careful here [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=494.96s)]
*  So jason the political calculus will be for the president to decide how much credit he actually wants to take [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=498.96s)]
*  For this bill because even though it has his name on it [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=505.91999999999996s)]
*  The contents of the bill [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=510.0s)]
*  are different [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=511.91999999999996s)]
*  in actual facts [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=513.52s)]
*  Than what I think he intended [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=516.64s)]
*  And what I mean by that is when you look inside of what happened in the 11th hour last night [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=519.28s)]
*  It's disappointing. This thing is like anti-doge if doge was meant to [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=524.5600000000001s)]
*  be a reflection [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=529.9200000000001s)]
*  Of the american voting population's desire for meaningful reform in government [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=532.24s)]
*  cost controls [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=538.1600000000001s)]
*  Some form of austerity and to get this debt spiral in check [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=540.0s)]
*  This is the opposite of that [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=544.64s)]
*  What happened was in the 11th hour [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=547.1999999999999s)]
*  You had a handful of people abstain [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  You had one person that passed away in the last few days [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=552.96s)]
*  You had one person that fell asleep on the floor of the house. So he wasn't even woken up for the vote [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=556.0s)]
*  And in the middle of all of that chaos [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=561.28s)]
*  What happened was all kinds of things were [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=565.12s)]
*  added and attached and canceled at the last minute because what happens is you have to have these [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=568.0s)]
*  Puts and takes as freeberg described if you want to spend over here [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=573.28s)]
*  You have to find a cut over there. But I think what happened was there was really not a lot of financial literacy used [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=577.44s)]
*  To decide what to actually put in and what to cut and that lack of discipline [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=585.0400000000001s)]
*  Is going to create [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=590.96s)]
*  I think a negative set of consequences. So what are those consequences? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=593.44s)]
*  Today the 10 year is around four and a half percent at the rate in which it's escalating since liberation day [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=599.06s)]
*  By the end of this year, we're going to be past five percent [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=607.22s)]
*  The 30 year [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=610.74s)]
*  Is on a rate now [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=612.26s)]
*  To get past six and a quarter maybe even reach six and a half percent [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=614.5s)]
*  Those are [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=620.74s)]
*  way beyond [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=622.8199999999999s)]
*  What most people thought [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=624.9s)]
*  Was a reasonable place to be for the united states economy. And so what will the implications be? [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=627.54s)]
*  As rates go to those levels [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=634.42s)]
*  You'll delever from the united states. You'll sell us debt [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=637.78s)]
*  You'll own things like gold and bitcoin if you're curious about what's happening to gold and bitcoin. They started to spike in the last few days [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=641.9399999999999s)]
*  You'll have ratings organizations that add to this cascade by downgrading the united states [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=650.42s)]
*  That happened on friday. You'll have very smart people [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=657.14s)]
*  starting to [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=661.3s)]
*  Signal that this is a much harder problem [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=663.54s)]
*  Than they initially thought that's how I personally interpreted elon's comments over the last few days [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=666.9s)]
*  So what was the house supposed to do? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=672.66s)]
*  I think what they were supposed to do was implement some form of austerity [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=675.3s)]
*  They were supposed to by the will of the people [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=680.1s)]
*  People [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=682.74s)]
*  Pass a rescission bill they were given that rescission bill. It was just nine billion dollars [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=683.86s)]
*  they couldn't even [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=689.54s)]
*  Pass a nine billion dollar rescission and instead they passed a four trillion dollar inflation to our debt [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=691.3s)]
*  Now you hand this to the senate the senate is in a very difficult place as well [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=697.22s)]
*  Do they want to quote unquote? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=701.86s)]
*  Claim victory and say here you go. President trump. Here's your bill [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=704.5s)]
*  But they'll further bastardize this thing and it will be even further away from what I think [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=708.3399999999999s)]
*  Benefits maga and benefits main street. So who does it benefit current course and speed right now? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=713.86s)]
*  This bill is about traditional republicans and traditional democrats [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=719.62s)]
*  circling the wagon [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=724.24s)]
*  And putting on a platter a set of things that I think will be hurtful to average americans [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=726.18s)]
*  You're going to see energy prices spike [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=732.66s)]
*  You're gutting the number of electrons that will be available for things like ai you're going to increase medicare prices [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=735.14s)]
*  And the math is wrong [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=742.42s)]
*  So when you sensitize this thing? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=744.18s)]
*  to a four and a half or five or five and a quarter rate [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=746.98s)]
*  So meaning not what the cbo used but the real conditions on the ground [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=752.1s)]
*  This thing is an albatross [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=757.4599999999999s)]
*  and I think unfortunately for president trump's agenda and for [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=759.4599999999999s)]
*  A maga movement [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=764.02s)]
*  This is the worst of all conditions the financial markets will punish us. And then the last thing i'll say is now [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=765.78s)]
*  To top it all off. I think that gerome powell [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=772.58s)]
*  Will see the writing on the wall [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=776.18s)]
*  Many aspects of this thing are inflationary and if they're not handled well by the senate [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=778.26s)]
*  He has a lot of room to actually increase interest rates [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=784.42s)]
*  So I would just say that the senate has an incredibly difficult job I think the president [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=788.42s)]
*  Has an even more difficult job about what to do right now, but the house did nobody favors. They did not do anybody a favor [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=794.34s)]
*  yesterday [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=801.44s)]
*  Here's the prediction from poly market on what will happen to federate cuts in [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=802.82s)]
*  2025 it's across the board. It seems like nobody can tell if it's going to be zero one two or three [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=809.12s)]
*  20 22 25 and 15 percent respectively [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=815.3s)]
*  respectively for those four options it's actually you don't speak for president trump. You're the czar of ai [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=819.28s)]
*  And crypto specifically so let's put that out there, but i'm curious your thoughts on [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=827.06s)]
*  What happened with doge? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=832.1s)]
*  Why are we continuing to spend ourselves into oblivion and what will the downstream? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=833.86s)]
*  Issues be here because this sounds like it's going to be inflationary [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=840.58s)]
*  This sounds like it's going to be hard for people to buy homes. It's going to create more austerity in the future [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=843.0600000000001s)]
*  How bad is this? And do you feel it's as bad as? [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=848.34s)]
*  Dave and tramath are framing it. Well, look, I mean I wish we had 435 members of the house who thought like freeberg about [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=851.94s)]
*  Spending and deficits. Um, we don't the democrats all want a lot more spending and a lot more taxes [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=859.78s)]
*  Remember if it wasn't for mansion cinema, we would have had that four and a half trillion dollar [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=865.7s)]
*  build back better [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=870.02s)]
*  And among the republicans in the house, unfortunately, we have a bunch of republicans who are pretty soft on spending [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=871.7s)]
*  I mean you can call them rhinos if you want [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=877.78s)]
*  And we only have what like a three vote margin in the house and the democrats are not cooperating in any way [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=880.1s)]
*  So you don't have that many votes to spare [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=885.78s)]
*  So what i'm saying here is you can't make the perfect enemy the good [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=888.58s)]
*  I think you have to be realistic about how much we can get done here [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=891.38s)]
*  And I do think that this bill does contain a lot of good things in it. There are a lot of [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=894.42s)]
*  Priorities for the administration in here. Do I wish it? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=898.8199999999999s)]
*  Cuts spending more. Yes. I mean do I wish [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=902.42s)]
*  That it made all the doge cuts permanent through rescissions. Yeah, absolutely. I think it's outrageous [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=905.06s)]
*  But there are enough house republicans who didn't want to [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=910.74s)]
*  Back up doge that that wasn't enacted but there are a lot of good things in the bill and I should just highlight them for balance here [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=913.78s)]
*  So the number one thing here is that this bill will permanently extend [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=921.3s)]
*  the 2017 tax cuts [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=926.1s)]
*  And if we don't pass this bill, let's just assume that we do nothing [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=928.58s)]
*  Okay, if we do nothing you're gonna get the largest tax increase [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=933.38s)]
*  In decades and it won't just affect the rich this affects the middle class as well the 2017 tax cuts increase the standard deduction [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=937.14s)]
*  Which is important for the middle class it raised the child tax credit [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=944.66s)]
*  so [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=948.1s)]
*  Again, if you do nothing you get a huge tax increase as soon as the 2017 tax cuts which trump passed [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=948.9s)]
*  Back in his first term when they sunset [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=956.1s)]
*  So that's number one in addition there are promises here that were made during the campaign [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=959.62s)]
*  To eliminate taxes on tips and overtime that have been enacted and the president promised to do those things and he is accomplishing those things [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=965.14s)]
*  So I think that's important. There's funding for the border wall here 10,000 new ice officers [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=972.9s)]
*  more detention beds [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=977.86s)]
*  And so on on energy it repeals a methane tax and unlocks new [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=979.62s)]
*  Oil and gas on federal lands and there's a bunch of other things as well [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=983.6999999999999s)]
*  So there are a lot of good things in here now to tomas point will this [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=987.14s)]
*  Bill be bad for the republicans prospects in the midterms [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=991.06s)]
*  I guess what I would say to that is I don't understand how you expect to do well in midterms if republicans preside over the largest [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=995.38s)]
*  tax increase [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1002.26s)]
*  in decades a tax increase that joe biden tried to get [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1003.4599999999999s)]
*  During his administration biden tried to raise taxes and couldn't get the votes for it [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1008.34s)]
*  But if we don't make those tax cuts permanent if we allow the sunset to happen [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1012.98s)]
*  Then you will accomplish what joe biden could not which is to raise taxes on the american people [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1016.8199999999999s)]
*  So look no bill like this that's passed by a one vote margin on straight party lines when you only have a three vote margin [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1021.6999999999999s)]
*  In the entire house is going to satisfy everyone here. Let me well shabab. Let me ask you a question there you have trump at [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1028.18s)]
*  his peak [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1035.62s)]
*  power [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1037.06s)]
*  You have all these threats of hey, we're gonna primary anybody if they don't do like what we're saying here [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1038.1s)]
*  Why isn't trump just coming in and using his power and just saying hey? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1043.3799999999999s)]
*  Not big enough get back to work. We need to cut spending period full stop and he's got that power [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1047.3s)]
*  I don't hear him saying that I do think that there are ways to enact the [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1053.4599999999998s)]
*  tax cuts [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1058.6599999999999s)]
*  And make them permanent and I think that that is a good part of [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1060.26s)]
*  What this bill did? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1065.06s)]
*  The problem was what happened from 11 pm to 6 am [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1067.46s)]
*  And that's all of the nonsense where [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1072.1s)]
*  I'll just be honest. I think the people in the house [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1075.3799999999999s)]
*  Are not nearly as financially literate as they need to be [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1078.26s)]
*  And I think what they wanted to do was pass something [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1082.34s)]
*  And throw it over the wall and say mission accomplished [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1086.26s)]
*  Now it's up to the senate [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1090.26s)]
*  And the good news is look the senate has these six-year election cycles for a reason it allows them to think strategically [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1092.1s)]
*  And see past what's right in front of them [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1099.54s)]
*  So I still think that there's a chance for the president to have his cake and eat it, too [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1102.98s)]
*  But I just want to highlight that as a supporter of his [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1107.3799999999999s)]
*  And a supporter of that maga agenda, which I think a lot of people voted for [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1110.82s)]
*  I just want to be honest and say this is not it [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1116.34s)]
*  And there has to be some meaningful reforms in the senate version of this thing that gets sent back to the house [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1119.22s)]
*  So i'll give you an example of one 81 percent of the incremental energy [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1125.62s)]
*  That's generated in the united states last year [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1131.7s)]
*  Came from private enterprises that were investing in short-term forms of power [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1135.06s)]
*  That have a credit and a transfer market tied to it [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1140.18s)]
*  This is just the financial machinery this is how [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1144.42s)]
*  Blackstone and goldman-sachs and brookfield and all of these big players move tens and hundreds of billions of dollars around [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1147.36s)]
*  They changed those rules at the 11th hour [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1156.5s)]
*  What is the impact of that? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1160.02s)]
*  Elon foreshadowed it nick. Maybe you can show the headline of the article [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1162.18s)]
*  He said we could be running into a power capacity issue by mid next year [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1166.58s)]
*  now [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1172.42s)]
*  If we knew that why would we take the short-term incentive away to generate more electrons? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1173.46s)]
*  All the great things that david has done that the president has done on ai. I mean we'll talk about what happened in the middle east [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1179.3s)]
*  But when the rubber meets the road and you actually have a shortage of electrons because these financial actors [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1186.66s)]
*  They're not you know, and in fairness to them they're acting rationally [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1193.46s)]
*  You take the financial incentive away and you can't underwrite this thing. What are they going to do? [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1197.14s)]
*  They're just going to stop doing it. So in the absence of electrons what happens prices go up? [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1201.06s)]
*  It's inflationary and now you'll have to allocate electrons. Does the electrons go to an ai data center? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1206.82s)]
*  Or does it go to a home? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1213.54s)]
*  In a different example actually on the residential side [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1215.22s)]
*  places like florida [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1218.58s)]
*  I think there was like an incentive [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1220.8999999999999s)]
*  for like batteries, so if you [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1222.8999999999999s)]
*  Were about to get hit by a hurricane [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1225.8600000000001s)]
*  You can buy these big battery systems from tesla as an example, but there are other ones generac and whatever train [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1228.26s)]
*  That was cut out [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1235.6200000000001s)]
*  and so [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1237.6200000000001s)]
*  In texas all of these impacts will have negative consequences [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1238.66s)]
*  My point is I think you have to really look at what happened in the 11th hour [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1242.0200000000002s)]
*  and fix those things because [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1246.8200000000002s)]
*  The problem with these plans [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1249.0600000000002s)]
*  Is you can't look at gains that are in years six through ten [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1251.3s)]
*  To justify pain in years one through five you can't do that because I understand how that mathematically makes sense [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1256.26s)]
*  It doesn't make sense practically for the average american. It's just not how life works. You don't go into a j-curve [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1263.78s)]
*  You know we do that as investors, right? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1269.94s)]
*  But you don't do that as a normal american which is be on the wrong side of the economy for four or five years [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1272.02s)]
*  In the hopes that year six and seven are good [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1276.98s)]
*  That's the point that has to get fixed [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1279.94s)]
*  I asked [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1282.82s)]
*  shaman the question shouldn't [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1283.8600000000001s)]
*  trump use his [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1285.6200000000001s)]
*  Capital is built up here and say not good enough make some cuts here [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1287.6200000000001s)]
*  What would you say to president trump if he was asking you for your advice? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1291.3s)]
*  Friedberg, I think the writings on the wall [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1296.4s)]
*  that the system is winning [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1300.26s)]
*  and the rebels came in and they tried to [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1303.46s)]
*  Fix the inefficiencies in government with doge under elon's leadership and our friend antonio's participation and a great group of individuals [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1307.6200000000001s)]
*  Who are true patriots who are spending time? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1315.6200000000001s)]
*  Trying to help reassess how the government operates [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1318.02s)]
*  And they as i've said from day one from my first visit to dc during inauguration weekend and every visit i've done since then [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1320.98s)]
*  I always leave after meeting with members of congress deeply worried that they won't actually do what they need to do to make the changes [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1327.6200000000001s)]
*  And the last line of defense ultimately is the president with his veto authority [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1335.46s)]
*  And his ability to tell people to go back rethink this and cut spending [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1340.02s)]
*  I feel like we're in a last-ditch effort and i'll tell you why I say it's last ditch [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1344.02s)]
*  I think that there's a relationship between what's going on in the united states and what's going on in japan nick [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1347.54s)]
*  If you'll pull up the japanese government four-year bond yield chart [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1352.34s)]
*  So just so you guys can kind of observe in the last couple of days. We've seen japanese bond yields soar [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1355.78s)]
*  From two and a half percent to three and a half percent remember japan owns 1.1 trillion dollars of u.s [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1361.94s)]
*  treasuries [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1367.3s)]
*  I'll just read a quote from a guy. Uh, who's the chief global strategist named albert edwards at society general [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1368.1000000000001s)]
*  And he said recent developments in japan [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1374.18s)]
*  May signal the end of the favorable investment cycle [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1378.18s)]
*  That's been established since the 2008 global financial crisis potentially reshaping global financial landscapes in the coming months [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1382.18s)]
*  Can I translate that because it's it's incredibly important what freebrook said but i'll translate that what he is saying [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1389.22s)]
*  So this is a guy from sock gen [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1394.26s)]
*  Since 2007 2008 every now and then the markets give you free money [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1396.26s)]
*  One of the most obvious free money trades was the yen carry trade [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1401.94s)]
*  and [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1406.42s)]
*  In order to to execute that trade you're effectively leveraging treasuries against the japanese [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1407.5400000000002s)]
*  bond market what he is saying [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1414.18s)]
*  Is that there is increasing risk that that trade unwinds [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1416.98s)]
*  When that trade unwinds what you're going to have are net sellers of up to as freebrook said [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1420.9s)]
*  A trillion plus dollars of u.s treasuries [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1426.5800000000002s)]
*  What will that do it will further exacerbate [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1430.26s)]
*  The market's reluctance to own u.s. Treasuries, which means yields go even higher [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1433.78s)]
*  Which means interest rates for businesses and individuals go higher [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1438.98s)]
*  Correct and the only way to keep those interest rates low [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1443.6200000000001s)]
*  Will be for the federal reserve to try and step in and buy those bonds [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1446.82s)]
*  Which will devalue the dollar [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1451.46s)]
*  And in his commentary he went on to say that the 20-year japanese bond auction that just took place [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1454.26s)]
*  Similar to the u.s. Treasury auction that just took place was the worst they've seen since 1987 [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1460.34s)]
*  That's how significant this event was in japan over the past week [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1467.7s)]
*  So the massive climb in bond yields in japan indicates a massive sell-off [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1471.46s)]
*  in credit [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1476.1799999999998s)]
*  And remember if you look at the historical perspective [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1477.3799999999999s)]
*  When the global reserve currency nation sees their debt sell off [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1481.1399999999999s)]
*  It usually is part of a global sell-off that happens. It's not just the u.s [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1485.7s)]
*  That gets affected and any one of these markets can cause a cataclysmic follow-on [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1490.02s)]
*  To the rest of the global financial markets like if japan sells off too much [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1495.22s)]
*  We are going to start to see a lot of unraveling happening [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1499.22s)]
*  That's the consequence. I think of this particular bill because it's it signals a lack of a reluctance to actually address [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1502.42s)]
*  Let me let me say something here. I called freeberg today on the way here. It's very rare [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1508.82s)]
*  That he and I agree [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1515.22s)]
*  About this kind of stuff because normally what I say is you're catastrophizing [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1517.38s)]
*  Sure, calm down [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1521.78s)]
*  But this is where I will say i'll put my money where my mouth is and i'll put the chips on the table to say [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1523.6200000000001s)]
*  This is the moment. This is the moment where we either [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1529.3s)]
*  Re-underwrite what we voted for [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1533.44s)]
*  Or [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1537.14s)]
*  We mistakenly passed this christmas tree concoction. It does have president trump's signature on the top of it [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1538.18s)]
*  It does have some features that he asked for [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1545.22s)]
*  But what I hope he sees and realizes is the details here matter [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1548.02s)]
*  And without some technical maneuvering in the senate [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1553.38s)]
*  This is a bad bill is constructed and if it passes [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1556.8200000000002s)]
*  Forget what any of us think? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1561.7s)]
*  The bond markets will act [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1563.8600000000001s)]
*  decisively [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1566.56s)]
*  And they're going to go in one direction and it's away from us [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1567.78s)]
*  And I just hope that we figure this out. It seems like a classic diffusion of responsibility here sacks [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1572.66s)]
*  you have congress senate and [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1578.18s)]
*  POTUS not willing to step up and say let's cut the spending [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1580.66s)]
*  Well, I don't think that's fair. I mean look the president backed up elon and doge first of all [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1585.94s)]
*  He created doge. She gave it the u.s digital service. He backed it up in every cabinet meeting and every public pronouncement [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1590.5800000000002s)]
*  There's a limit though to what he can do congress has the power of the purse and we said on a previous episode [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1596.5s)]
*  That at the end of the day for the doge cuts to become permanent [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1602.02s)]
*  Congress has to incorporate that into the budget [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1605.38s)]
*  And the reality is there are still a number of these like old bull appropriators on the republican side [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1607.94s)]
*  Who just are not wired to make spending cuts, but why are we hearing him vocally saying? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1615.0600000000002s)]
*  Stop this madness. He is the most vocal guy in the world who mixes it up on every topic on the planet [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1620.9s)]
*  Why is he not the benefit of the doubt? Let's give him the benefit of the doubt [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1626.8200000000002s)]
*  He's probably working it all in the back channel [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1629.94s)]
*  There are the things that he wants and he's in the midst of negotiating as well. But my point is just this [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1632.18s)]
*  The level of financial illiteracy in this bill will come back to bite america in the ass [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1638.1000000000001s)]
*  Look here's the problem is that what you guys want to sell right now is austerity [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1643.8600000000001s)]
*  And the reality is that the politicians in washington are not buying austerity right now. I mean, that's what you want is austerity [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1649.3s)]
*  Yep, and the reality is the only way you get true austerity something like a painful set of changes [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1656.26s)]
*  Is when both parties link arms and jump off the cliff together and and make those changes the democrats right now have no willingness [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1662.66s)]
*  To do that they're opposed to doing this. This is a straight line [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1669.78s)]
*  Party reconciliation vote. I think you're trying to overload this vote with way too much stuff [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1673.46s)]
*  You're trying to basically say that this vote has to fix america's fiscal problems just not going to happen [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1678.42s)]
*  I mean look I agree with you that the fiscal situation needs to get fixed [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1683.94s)]
*  This is just not the vote where it's going to happen. You cannot exacerbate it [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1687.54s)]
*  Well, I don't know. I mean look I understand that this doesn't have as much stuff as as we want [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1690.66s)]
*  I mean, like I said, I want to see the doge cuts made permanent but [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1694.58s)]
*  The alternative to this bill, let's say the alternative is just do nothing [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1698.82s)]
*  That is actually meaningfully worse because you will get a massive tax increase massive [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1702.4199999999998s)]
*  I think president trump inherited a biden economy that was already feeling pretty shaky [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1707.78s)]
*  I don't know what the argument is for a massive tax increase in an economy. That's not doing great [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1711.86s)]
*  I'd rather see the tax cuts made permanent. I'd rather see the no tax on tips and overtime [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1717.06s)]
*  Implemented important campaign promises. I'd rather see funding for the border wall [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1722.24s)]
*  I mean, these are all important things that we need to have happen [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1726.74s)]
*  And I just don't think that this bill is how you're going to solve but what i'm saying is why do you pay for that with? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1729.54s)]
*  Electron supply for homes and ai. I don't know. I mean you're talking about a pretty esoteric issue. Chema. This is not the same as [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1734.72s)]
*  Solving the u.s. Budget situation. Why do it by doing medicaid cuts? Why well let's talk about the medicaid cuts first of all [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1741.54s)]
*  I mean you're being a little bit [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1747.46s)]
*  Schizophrenic about this. I mean you guys are saying that you want to see more cuts [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1748.96s)]
*  But then you also believe that the medicaid cuts are a bad idea. So you got to kind of choose [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1753.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying that I think all cuts are great. All spending cuts across the board. Yeah cuts across the board spread it out [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1757.22s)]
*  You gotta decide what you're opposed to are you opposed to cuts or you want more of them? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1762.98s)]
*  I want more cuts and given the fiscal situation. I'm actually if if someone showed up and said hey, we're gonna increase taxes [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1766.82s)]
*  I'd say that's what we got to do right now. Everyone's got to take a hit on this [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1772.74s)]
*  But hey, I know i'm going to be alone in that so i'm not going to try and make that argument [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1775.38s)]
*  I guess the question for you. No, you're not alone in that. I agree with you. Well, let me ask a question sacks [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1778.82s)]
*  What do you think is the moment when? [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1782.98s)]
*  The two parties lock arms and do jump together. What is the conditions that need to be kind of prevalent? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1785.46s)]
*  For us to take, you know draconian austerity measures probably the bond market forces it on the politicians force it on washington [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1792.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're right. You're an economist by background [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1798.9s)]
*  Do you do you see that happening right now? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1801.22s)]
*  Like do you see this the sell-off that's happening not just in the u.s [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1802.74s)]
*  But everyone that's linked to the u.s with japan and so on don't you think that the market's telling us that [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1805.78s)]
*  This might be the moment it could be the moment but you know [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1810.82s)]
*  I remember the first week of april when larry summers came on the pod and said that the markets were melting down and [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1813.86s)]
*  That was a different moment that he was trying to sell in favor of his policy [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1819.3s)]
*  So my point is just there's market volatility and we won't know for a while whether this means anything. It could just be a blip [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1823.54s)]
*  Right. So look you asked me what are the conditions for getting austerity? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1829.6999999999998s)]
*  I think that austerity will have to be imposed on washington from the outside [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1833.78s)]
*  Washington's not going to find the will [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1838.26s)]
*  Internally, we had a wonderful moment here where you have elon come in with doge which the president made possible [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1840.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay, no other president would even have done this agree big credit for that the credit where you get a total outsider to come in [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1848.02s)]
*  and bring a team of like [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1855.3s)]
*  young big bald geniuses [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1857.6999999999998s)]
*  And you let them go through these departments line by line and start deleting things [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1860.02s)]
*  Okay, and they made I think great progress [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1864.26s)]
*  I think they found out 160 billion a year of cuts that can be made administratively [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1866.66s)]
*  Beyond that they need congress to approve it and I will acknowledge that there are still a number of soft on spending [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1872.02s)]
*  rhino republicans and there's just not a majority for the types of [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1880.26s)]
*  Austerity and cuts that you guys would like to see. I mean, that's the reality [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1885.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but I still think that the question with this bill is just how pure you want to be [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1889.5400000000002s)]
*  My point is just are you going to make the perfect the enemy of the good? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1894.34s)]
*  I don't think you're going to get austerity out of washington right now. It's just not in the cards [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1897.06s)]
*  The question is whether this bill is basically better than the status quo [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1900.6599999999999s)]
*  And I and I think it is because the tax cuts to your point [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1904.82s)]
*  Without opining on it. I think what's going to happen is the bond market will [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1908.5s)]
*  Sensitize this budget at real rates. They're not going to use the 3.6 that free bro pointed to [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1912.8799999999999s)]
*  They're just going to re underwrite this at five five and a quarter five and a half [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1918.6599999999999s)]
*  That is a very different [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1922.4199999999998s)]
*  Risk exposure, I think [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1925.54s)]
*  And so to your point they'll react [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1927.54s)]
*  If it looks like it passes as is then that's what they'll do and to your point david [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1930.02s)]
*  We'll know in the next 60 to 90 days [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1933.6999999999998s)]
*  Let's say that this is just a blip in the market and it's not some larger once in a century type event [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1936.02s)]
*  The reality is we don't know exactly what's going to happen. Look, I don't like america's fiscal picture at all [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1941.62s)]
*  But what if the ai and robotics revolution plays out in the most optimistic way over the next decade? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1945.86s)]
*  And it's massively deflationary [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1951.86s)]
*  And we get basically ai power robots expanding the economy massively you need power for that [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1953.86s)]
*  I get that and we need to do power generation for sure [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1959.9399999999998s)]
*  But my point is just what if the new technology provides an answer? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1962.6599999999999s)]
*  To the fiscal situation that's not currently on the table. I think it's my point is is washington's not going to embrace [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1968.26s)]
*  I understand but you're going to have brownouts and blackouts of average human homes to do that [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1974.1s)]
*  No, you shouldn't have to make these decisions those are dumb trade-offs [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1978.18s)]
*  You're not even able to solve the power generation problem in a reconciliation bill [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1981.3s)]
*  And I want to just add my two cents at the end here [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1984.34s)]
*  Leadership starts at the top [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1987.3s)]
*  This president acts unilaterally all the time whether it's immigration dei [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1989.06s)]
*  He has no problem and this is what he is doing. He's endorsing [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=1994.82s)]
*  This bill he's saying it's big. It's beautiful. He is saying this is historic [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2000.26s)]
*  I think this is bad leadership. I'll just say it straight out. He was elected to balance his budget and to have austerity [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2006.42s)]
*  He's going to put more onto the debt and we sat here on this very podcast the four of us and said this was the [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2012.58s)]
*  most important issue on the world and trump is [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2017.94s)]
*  Putting gasoline on the fire. I think it's bad leadership. Let's continue on the docket [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2021.62s)]
*  I suggest you look at the constitution because the power of the purse rests with congress. He's endorsing this he's endorsing it [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2027.94s)]
*  It's not even putting up a fight when it comes to immigration these other areas the president has far more unilateral power [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2034.18s)]
*  And he's used that every chance he gets but when it comes to spending you have to get congress on board [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2040.3400000000001s)]
*  This is a bill that passed with a one vote margin [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2045.46s)]
*  I don't know where you think the opportunity is to squeeze out more concessions from congress [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2048.58s)]
*  I don't think it's there he could speak up and say do better. He's doing the opposite [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2053.7000000000003s)]
*  He's doing the opposite this bill passed by one vote margin [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2058.82s)]
*  It was hanging on by a thread and if it failed you get [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2061.3s)]
*  Basically hundreds of billions of tax increases, which we don't need right now [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2065.54s)]
*  And you know in terms of in terms of I think he's trying in terms of republican prospects [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2069.3s)]
*  Look people vote for republicans to do two things cut taxes and cut spending [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2074.98s)]
*  I wish that this bill did two out of two [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2079.7000000000003s)]
*  It does one out of two with some of the second one like with the medicaid stuff [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2082.6600000000003s)]
*  If we didn't at least cut taxes there'd be no reason to vote for republicans none [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2087.7799999999997s)]
*  You all are much closer to him than I am [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2092.66s)]
*  You all should be challenging him to not endorse this and to do the opposite [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2094.5s)]
*  That would be the profile and courage then we get the biggest tax increase in decades [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2098.18s)]
*  Great. No, he should just go to everybody and say do better [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2102.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't agree with that tactic [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2104.66s)]
*  I think the better tactic is to do what he did but then work behind the scenes and help the senate implement the technical [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2105.94s)]
*  Guardrails that make the bill better than it as is look nobody thinks that this bill is going to pass as is [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2112.66s)]
*  It's going to go through its own set of changes in the senate [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2118.82s)]
*  Now I think the opportunity is to understand these puts and takes with a little bit more detail and a little bit more mathematical [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2122.18s)]
*  Precision and fix it. So I still hold out hope that we're going to get to a better place [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2127.92s)]
*  But he's going to have much more influence jason by actually taking the positive path than throwing everybody under the bus the real question [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2132.18s)]
*  Will be in 30 days or 45 days [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2139.38s)]
*  What is the final version of this thing and whatever gets passed and signed by him? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2142.2599999999998s)]
*  There will have been enough time to understand it and you'll see the real-time reactions all i'm trying to [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2147.3s)]
*  indicate is I think that [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2154.1s)]
*  This was a moment where people were very pensively optimistic [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2156.1s)]
*  that the approach of doge would really be embraced and that we see some broad-scale attempts to at least and [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2159.86s)]
*  You know freebrook said this just to go back to 2019 even if we don't do anything else [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2166.66s)]
*  Just go back to 2019 pretend. Covid didn't happen. Yeah, and we would be by the way if we did that [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2170.9s)]
*  We would have a budget surplus [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2175.46s)]
*  And the bonds would be trading down to two percent yields again. I mean we would be in such an incredible condition [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2177.7000000000003s)]
*  We've got two percent inflation right now [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2182.98s)]
*  Anyway, we don't need to beat the dead [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2185.06s)]
*  I wish I wish there were 218 members of the house who thought like I hear you. I hear you [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2187.86s)]
*  Listen, this guy is saying he's going to primary anybody who you know, just doesn't I don't think I don't think he's right [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2192.9s)]
*  He should be speaking up right now. I'll tell you what give him the line item veto and then let's talk [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2198.5s)]
*  Right. How about you saying guys spend less money? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2203.7000000000003s)]
*  It doesn't have to throw them under the bus jamoth. It could be something very subtle [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2206.42s)]
*  But you make it that way what you the way that you position it is like you make it such a black and white thing [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2209.86s)]
*  And it's I speak up is a black and white. He's saying this is a great bill. No, but what i'm saying is he is [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2214.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm guessing I don't know but i'm gonna assume [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2222.7400000000002s)]
*  Working behind the scenes and what you're saying is he should virtue signal and prognosticate in public and i'm saying that [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2225.7s)]
*  I never said that's what you're asking him to do. No, i'm not i'm asking him to say reduce spending in the bill [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2232.02s)]
*  Because that's good for america this bill cuts 880 billion for medicaid over a decade [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2239.38s)]
*  Which is something that already is politically tough and controversial it imposes work requirements for able-bodied adults [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2244.74s)]
*  This is similar to what bilklin did back in 1996 with welfare reform [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2252.18s)]
*  Basically saying that you can't be a layabout and get welfare. So these are relatively tough things to do politically [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2256.42s)]
*  It's like do I want to see even more cuts? Yeah, absolutely [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2263.14s)]
*  But again when you have a one vote margin whose vote are you going to pick up by doing more cuts? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2266.1s)]
*  I guess you get thomas massey maybe but you probably have to go all the way to balance the budget to get his vote [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2270.18s)]
*  I don't know what it takes to get a thomas massey vote [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2274.8199999999997s)]
*  So I don't know what votes you think you're going to pick up by cutting even more [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2277.46s)]
*  And we can't afford to lose even one vote. It's literally the art of the deal. We got to move on [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2282.02s)]
*  I will move on but if you're going to tell me it's i'm asking virtual signal [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2285.94s)]
*  You're going to lie about my position. I will correct it's been 40 minutes. So my position is not to virtual signal [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2288.9s)]
*  It's to go flip a couple people and say do better [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2292.9s)]
*  Okay, it was a huge week for ai again. Google and the ghost of steve jobs took center stage [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2295.3s)]
*  Let's start with google here. They had their i.o conference on tuesday. This is where [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2301.7000000000003s)]
*  They show a bunch of new stuff they get developers to come together to embrace their products and the stock ripped five percent on the day [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2306.58s)]
*  Which might be a turning point for google again today and up again today [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2314.9s)]
*  Search was the big announcement and we had a discussion with sergue about that in miami and we had multiple discussions about it here over the last couple of months [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2319.3s)]
*  They demoed something called ai mode. No, not founder mode ai mode and they compared it to regular search [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2328.82s)]
*  Here it is on the screen if you're watching us on youtube or spotify a very elegant app [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2334.02s)]
*  And so here you have somebody searching [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2339.38s)]
*  And what you can see is in ai mode. It looks like a nice comprehensive search instead of 10 blue links [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2342.1s)]
*  And tons of advertising so you can flip over and see all or you can do a perplexity like search here [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2348.58s)]
*  We're showing you what this search would have looked like the ai summary at the top and then your 10 blue links [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2355.06s)]
*  It's distinctly different it is exactly chamath what you talked about somebody has to have the courage to flip the switch here [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2360.42s)]
*  and so that's [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2366.82s)]
*  Was the big drop and I think that in your interview dave didn't sundar say [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2368.58s)]
*  We're going to integrate ads into that kind of result. Yes, the comprehensive search result [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2373.46s)]
*  I think there were a couple of things that sundar said in the interview that showed up in a really important way at i.o [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2378.1s)]
*  The first was exactly this which is to make ai mode more ubiquitous in search and effectively over time replace search [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2385.08s)]
*  With this ai mode experience, which they've been testing in a small group and now they've expanded [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2391.88s)]
*  Very specifically to kind of chamath's point a couple weeks ago. They should try and flip the switch [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2397.0s)]
*  Well, it appears they've done that the key question and the challenge has always been what's the revenue per query? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2401.4s)]
*  How are you going to make money? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2406.2s)]
*  And I think one of the other kind of interesting announcements that we saw come out of i.o [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2408.04s)]
*  Which indicates the business model opportunity here is not just ai mode in search, but some of the other tools that they've launched [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2412.86s)]
*  Bundling them together and they have this product offering called ai ultra for 250 a month that includes [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2420.28s)]
*  You know youtube premium it includes 30 terabytes of storage on your google account [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2426.6200000000003s)]
*  It includes access to flow which is their movie creating [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2430.94s)]
*  Ai model where you can use they have vo3 gemini and imaging below it. Those are the three models that contribute to this [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2435.26s)]
*  movie creation a studio tool and they've launched a number of other kind of [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2441.42s)]
*  High value gemini models as standalone research apps and you can get access to all of these kind of high-powered tools [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2446.06s)]
*  For 250 dollars, so I do think this sets a new direction that google that google is likely testing [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2452.62s)]
*  As a business model which subscriptions you're saying can we make yeah very high dollar volume [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2457.9s)]
*  subscription model for consumers that over time [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2462.84s)]
*  Could create a very meaningful shift in the revenue mix for google away from ads and more towards subscription revenue [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2466.06s)]
*  That we already see in some of the consumer services like youtube and youtube tv [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2472.94s)]
*  This is I think a really important turning point. I would say if anyone were to identify the week [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2477.66s)]
*  That google really pivoted into the ai business model [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2482.38s)]
*  It might be this week they launched over 15 products at this thing and another important one [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2485.58s)]
*  I'll highlight sundar talked about this in the interview. I did with him [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2489.58s)]
*  In the early days of google from 2002 till about 2011 google had this [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2493.42s)]
*  Kind of playground of products called google labs where they would introduce new stuff [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2498.3s)]
*  I don't know if you guys remember checking out some new stuff [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2502.14s)]
*  So they relaunched google labs like a year ago or so [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2504.38s)]
*  And as sundar said they're putting a lot more stuff in labs [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2508.06s)]
*  So labs is now becoming the new test bed and they launched a bunch of the announcements in labs [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2511.34s)]
*  So that becomes the place where they'll say what's the business model? What's the use case? Do people like it? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2517.02s)]
*  Do they love it if they do it graduates out of labs into full production? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2521.58s)]
*  And I think that opens up the opportunity for some of the things like chamak was talking about where they could experiment new ideas new modalities [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2525.66s)]
*  And then productize them if they were and they discontinued labs in 2011. They just brought it back last year brought it back [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2531.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, sax you I think mentioned hey, they have the i'm feeling lucky button here. They put [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2536.62s)]
*  The ai search up in the top bar. We have images video shopping etc news. We're all familiar with that [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2541.8199999999997s)]
*  What do you think just swap out i'm feeling lucky for delight me with ai and and [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2548.2999999999997s)]
*  Or maybe just if you're a product manager there because you've done a lot of great product work in your career [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2553.1s)]
*  Before you were in politics, would you just ab test this and say anybody who let's say doesn't click on ads? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2558.22s)]
*  Let's send them to the ai search and just see how they do because they don't click on ads anyway [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2564.7s)]
*  And then just let the ad clickers keep going to the ad product [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2568.22s)]
*  Well, I think you know we were all calling on previous podcasts for google to risk [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2571.58s)]
*  Disrupting their dominance and search by moving to more of an ai-based model [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2578.94s)]
*  And I think they've taken an important step in that direction. They've sort of thread the needle here between [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2583.82s)]
*  Keeping their old ui and product and then also incorporating the the new sort of [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2590.06s)]
*  ai [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2595.6600000000003s)]
*  Ui so this is a compromise. I mean they're trying to have their cake and eat it too [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2596.62s)]
*  It ultimately feels a little bit like a transitional move. I doubt [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2600.22s)]
*  That this will be the end point but given their need to protect their search business while also [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2603.5s)]
*  Developing their ai business. This feels like a pretty good compromise. I think I mean it certainly shows that they're in the game and they're not going to get [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2610.62s)]
*  Caught totally flat-footed and let the whole world disrupt them while they're trying to figure out ai. I mean they are responding now [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2619.2599999999998s)]
*  And the market seemed to like it. I think they were up like five percent on this news [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2625.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and then up again today chamatha you talked about having some design sense and [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2629.8199999999997s)]
*  Maybe some bravery here looks like uh, they're pretty much on the cusp of doing that the search reloads [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2635.66s)]
*  Results in ai look elegant. They look uh, dare I say perplexity like [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2642.7s)]
*  when you look at them, I would say [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2647.3399999999997s)]
*  I would like to have that as my default. I think when i'm doing search [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2649.7400000000002s)]
*  What do you think of the product? We're showing it here again. And what do you think the roadmap will be? I gave one possibility [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2654.3s)]
*  Saks is totally right. I think that this is not the destination, but they've taken a really important step [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2661.58s)]
*  And now they have to follow through we all know what has to happen. So I think we're all just going to debate [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2668.1400000000003s)]
*  When it happens and I think what the market is betting is that it's going to happen in the next 18 months [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2673.74s)]
*  So what is it exactly? [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2677.8999999999996s)]
*  It's when ai mode becomes the default for a large swath of existing google users [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2680.14s)]
*  How will we know that happens? They're probably running a b tests right now [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2685.5s)]
*  They're probably gauging behavioral patterns of which kinds of users what the actual impacts to search are [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2689.2599999999998s)]
*  And what impacts exist to cpcs to cost per click which is one of the inventory types that they use [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2695.8199999999997s)]
*  But I think this is the beginning of a process. I suspect it'll be done in less than a year [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2701.58s)]
*  And for a large swath of users [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2706.62s)]
*  They are going to put ai in the front door. I think that's a fait accompli [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2709.58s)]
*  I think we're just now debating the mechanics of getting there per how saks alluded to it [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2712.86s)]
*  That's a really powerful step. But here's jason. I think I go back to [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2717.58s)]
*  What they also have to keep in mind [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2723.02s)]
*  What you don't want to have when you're doing a search [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2725.82s)]
*  What you don't want to have when you are [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2729.58s)]
*  Going through an innovator's dilemma [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2733.8199999999997s)]
*  Is to have the competitor [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2736.2999999999997s)]
*  Be on to the next lily pad [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2738.54s)]
*  While you are figuring out the current lily pad and the reason I bring this up and i'm sure we'll talk about this is [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2741.1s)]
*  It's impressive what sam altman is doing right now at open ai [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2748.06s)]
*  I don't know if it was a troll or not, but to buy i.o [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2753.34s)]
*  Johnny ives firm at the end of google i.o [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2756.7s)]
*  And I read an article that said open ai has been trying to do this for a couple years in a row [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2760.22s)]
*  But what sam alluded to in that video was some [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2765.1s)]
*  Next gen whizbang device that they've been working on that was the industrial logic for the mna [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2768.22s)]
*  I think what you don't want to have happen if you're google [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2776.22s)]
*  Is to finally get the [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2779.8199999999997s)]
*  Search thing right and then now have to play catch up on some device [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2782.06s)]
*  So I would encourage them to just run the ab tests and shorten the window of measurement [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2786.54s)]
*  I think we all know what has to happen [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2793.02s)]
*  So it's probably better to just do it sooner than later and then start to allocate the incremental resources to these [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2796.06s)]
*  new form factors and other things so that they [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2803.1000000000004s)]
*  Shorten the distance between them and open ai. Let me tee up exactly what happened open ai. They're the makers of chat gpt [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2806.94s)]
*  Bought johnny ives startup. The startup is called i.o [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2815.02s)]
*  They bought it for 6.5 billion in that all stock deal [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2818.06s)]
*  If you remember johnny ive was steve jobs collaborator and designer iphone ipod ipad all that beautiful stuff [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2821.18s)]
*  So open ai is buying i.o. i.o is not loved from if you've heard about that [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2829.18s)]
*  That's his design agency and so they did a really interesting rom-com video and if you guys saw this it's incredibly [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2833.26s)]
*  And ridiculous, let's play it. All right, here are two people having a meat cube dude. You're right [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2840.0600000000004s)]
*  It's like a love story. It literally is like a meat cube here comes sam [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2846.3s)]
*  He's walking around san francisco [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2850.86s)]
*  And he's a genius according to this video [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2853.1800000000003s)]
*  Here's what i've said about sam johnny ives like i've never met a man who's so brilliant. It's so humble [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2856.5400000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's embarrassing the language the responsibility that sam bears is actually [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2861.5s)]
*  Honestly beyond my comprehension. He's a co-founder of i.o. Yeah open ai already owns 20% of it. Yes, no no 23% [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2866.38s)]
*  Of all as all sam altman deals have you learned anything they're conflicted [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2873.98s)]
*  But the copy here, I just want to get your gentleman the gentleman's comment on [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2880.06s)]
*  What I see you worrying about are other people or about customers about society about culture [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2884.38s)]
*  And to me that tells me everything I want to know about something you guys are such haters on this [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2890.46s)]
*  I'm excited to see what this thing is. Oh, I am but I just thought this you guys are like you're falling for it [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2894.54s)]
*  I don't get what should it be. I don't like it. What is this? It's just two guys walking around [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2900.06s)]
*  I don't know why we're even talking about but they're going getting nine minutes though. I watched the nine minute video [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2903.98s)]
*  I wanted my nine minutes back. Nothing happened. I want the device. They say they have a device [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2908.14s)]
*  Okay, i'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. They've invented something that they say is world [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2912.94s)]
*  Changing okay, but they this is again. I'm just using their words and he's sipping a macchiato there. So that's important [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2918.68s)]
*  Oh my god, you are so falling for espresso video. This is your problem. Look at the glasses [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2925.5s)]
*  I think the clue is in the video. Look at johnny ive's glasses. The fact that we're even talking about this [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2930.7s)]
*  Those are ar glasses. Let me let me tell you my 2007 my 2007 apple iphone moment [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2935.42s)]
*  Steve announced the iphone [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2942.46s)]

*  I was going to vegas so I got it on a friday [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2949.02s)]
*  And I had it in my hand [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2952.1400000000003s)]
*  The way that people looked at me for those three days. I've never been looked at that ever or since [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2954.54s)]
*  They liked you people like what you were feeling was love and admiration. All I had all I had was music [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2960.54s)]
*  There was no multiple screens. You couldn't do it. No apps. Yeah, but it was so [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2965.7400000000002s)]
*  mesmerizing and my point is [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2971.1600000000003s)]
*  You're right. I may have fallen for it, which may seem crazy [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2973.72s)]
*  But when I saw that video I thought hey, hold on [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2976.7599999999998s)]
*  All i'm saying is if there is a next generation device that they are somebody else my my only comment is [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2979.16s)]
*  I think google is so wonderful. I love the people there [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2985.3999999999996s)]
*  I just want them to be on the forward foot and I just don't want them to be reacting for the next five years [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2988.52s)]
*  That's all i'm saying. Here's what sam said about johnny ive [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2993.08s)]
*  Johnny is the deepest thinker of anyone i've ever met. I mean this was a love story [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=2995.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm not just saying what they said about each other. Okay, let's handicap it here. I'll tell you exactly what's happening [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3000.68s)]
*  It's the glasses he's wearing the glasses in there. They're making smart glasses [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3005.7200000000003s)]
*  Sax what are they making? What are these two guys up to? You know these guys, you know both of them for 20 years [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3009.48s)]
*  Come on now, you know what's going on. Just spill the beans. Let me [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3015.8s)]
*  Spell it me express a hot take here [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3019.48s)]
*  But let me express in the form of a question because I don't want to I don't want to be too definitive [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3021.88s)]
*  Which is the retort [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3026.52s)]
*  Which is is johnny ive just a media creation [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3029.48s)]
*  I mean [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3034.3599999999997s)]
*  No, seriously, just did steve jobs manifest him. Well, I know he did good work at apple [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3035.3999999999996s)]
*  Okay, don't get me wrong, but the software was done by someone else right? So he did the beautiful eddie q so [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3040.8399999999997s)]
*  You know the whole and scott forstall industrial design. Yes, the hardware looks beautiful with the beveled edges [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3048.12s)]
*  To paint a glass with a beveled edge. Okay, great [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3054.3599999999997s)]
*  It's so dispensable. He has this beautiful english accent which everyone associates with intelligence, right? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3057.7999999999997s)]
*  So he could describe anything and it's going to sound amazing and taste and taste 15% smarter, right? [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3063.64s)]
*  so [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3070.6s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, maybe he's like parlayed this incredible [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3071.64s)]
*  reputation that he's built in the media [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3075.7799999999997s)]
*  into two percent of [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3078.52s)]
*  Open AI. It's incredible. What a trait [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3080.3599999999997s)]
*  What a trait do you think it was done at that 300 billion dollar price? You think it was done at like a cheaper price? Yes [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3083.64s)]
*  Yes [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3089.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean there is an argument i'm gonna go in sax's corner here. I'm gonna go into conspiracy corner here. I'm gonna say [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3091.0s)]
*  Dieter rams designed the iphone not johnny ive pull it up nick. Well, i'm gonna say tony fidel designed the iphone [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3097.0s)]
*  Okay [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3103.0s)]
*  But if you don't know who dida rams is I mean if you look at the transistor radio made the ipod if you pull up [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3103.24s)]
*  The brawn radio here is the power mac if you look at the iMac basically what did steve jobs? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3110.2799999999997s)]
*  Are you accusing johnny ive of ripping off a german industrial designer? Is that what you're doing right now? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3117.16s)]
*  Artists copy and mature artists. I am saying [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3122.68s)]
*  90 percent of what apple did was steal dita rams design. I will die on that hill 90 percent stolen [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3126.3599999999997s)]

*  Totally ripped off from dita. It was all inspired by the germans [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3159.48s)]
*  Sorry, so you're saying dita brawn is like the kaiser sose of our entire physical world [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3163.64s)]
*  Here's the speaker on the left. Look at the iMac on the right these guys took every design [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3169.08s)]
*  That dita did in the 60s and 70s even the 50s [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3174.44s)]
*  And they photocopied it and they put an apple logo on and I could stop stop stop stop sax am I wrong? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3178.2799999999997s)]
*  stop [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3185.0s)]
*  I didn't know about the dita brawn angle [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3186.2s)]
*  I mean listen it is what it is. I mean look everyone at apple did amazing work [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3188.7599999999998s)]
*  There's no question about it. Yeah, but I but i'm just saying like I don't quite get this like [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3194.2s)]
*  Design god reputation that's been created a little bit [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3200.8399999999997s)]
*  But I would say that it's certainly it's making free brilliant. I get a parlay that into two percent [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3204.52s)]
*  By the way, is that what san francisco looks like like I never thought every time I go to san francisco [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3209.0s)]
*  It's so disgusting and it's cloudy and cold but yes, did they find the one day where like the sun was shining in that hellscape? [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3214.12s)]
*  Yeah [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3221.48s)]
*  There were no homeless people and there was no fentanyl. I don't know what happened yuck on a serious note [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3222.3599999999997s)]
*  What I would say is maybe what this deal indicates is I mean obviously is that open ai is going to do something with hardware [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3227.24s)]
*  Sure, it could be a new kind of phone. That is ai first as opposed to the wall of applications or maybe [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3233.48s)]
*  It's like some sort of like pendant thing that like tracks what's going on around you and feeds it into ai [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3240.76s)]
*  So it can give you more context, you know, maybe like in the movie her who knows but it seems like they'll do something with [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3245.4s)]
*  devices in the physical world [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3252.5s)]
*  So that would be the play I guess I guess the question you have to ask is will it make [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3255.96s)]
*  Open ai one percent more valuable if it's a 300 billion dollar company two percent more valuable. Yes. Thank you [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3262.04s)]
*  Will it make it more than two percent more valuable if it makes it one percent more valuable is worth [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3268.04s)]
*  The the swing I guess right I heard an interesting factoid yesterday, which is by somebody who was looking at [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3273.0800000000004s)]
*  Open ai equity all of the rounds before the 300 billion dollar round from soft bank had essentially a feature where there was like [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3281.4s)]
*  A hard rate of return and 100x or something. No, but the ability to put the stock back if they weren't able to do the conversion [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3289.88s)]
*  To a for-profit company, etc, etc [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3297.48s)]
*  and in the 300 billion dollar round [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3300.1200000000003s)]
*  Apparently, it's much cleaner and it's essentially like sub [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3303.4s)]
*  Nucco that is owned and [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3307.7000000000003s)]
*  I thought to myself like wow at those valuations. I would have expected the terms to ratchet up [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3310.36s)]
*  and instead it seems like the terms have ratcheted down which is [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3316.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't know. It's either it's either commentary on the [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3321.0s)]
*  Negotiating prowess of open ai and their team and or the risk management philosophy of soft bank and the lack thereof [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3323.88s)]
*  I do think you know, he is a great designer and he will make it one or two percent better design matters [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3332.84s)]
*  So if he makes it I mean there's a chance right sax that he could make the product five or ten percent better through design [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3338.28s)]
*  I don't think it's gonna be one or two percent better [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3343.56s)]
*  I think it's gonna be either zero or a doubling of the company's value something like that, right? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3345.16s)]
*  Like either he develops an iphone like amazing hit product no one's agreed for some new consumer device that [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3349.88s)]
*  You know really could take the company to another level or probably [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3357.1600000000003s)]
*  They do something that kind of doesn't work [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3360.6800000000003s)]
*  so it's more of like a two percent option against a strike of doubling the value of the company i'm surprised it hasn't leaked because in the [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3363.0s)]
*  In sam's update or whatever. He said that the that the executive team was shown the device and that he has it [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3370.52s)]
*  Who [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3377.0s)]
*  So what is it? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3378.28s)]
*  It's it's definitely going to be a pendant or glasses. It's got to be those two form factors [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3379.72s)]
*  And he was the investor in humane. Remember if that's what you're getting from the apple people [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3384.36s)]
*  Yeah, I will take the field against that. What are the odds and how much money do you want to bet? [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3388.52s)]
*  Okay, here we go. So I think it's a [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3392.2s)]
*  Appendent like a wearable we'd have to define that so like humane i'll say it's not a pendant [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3395.56s)]
*  Okay glasses, I get what are you gonna give me you give me odds [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3400.52s)]
*  I'll give you give me a nice. Well, we'll just do even money. Let's do even money [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3403.0s)]
*  I don't know. Whatever you want. However many thousands of dollars you want to bet even money. How about you give me two to one 10 times? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3410.2s)]
*  Because you have every option I have to pick them [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3418.2s)]
*  No, no, no, that's a pretty good [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3421.32s)]
*  This is my risk. I want to get it on the bed here [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3424.6s)]
*  All right, let's move on. All right [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3428.04s)]
*  We covered trump's trip to the middle east last week, but our bestie sax was there as well [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3429.32s)]
*  um [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3434.6800000000003s)]
*  And uh, you did uh, you got a couple photos to show and uh, you met a lot of friends there [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3435.56s)]
*  Tell us about the experience of did you go about first of all, did you go on air force one? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3441.0s)]
*  That's what everybody wants to know or did you go on air sax? I took my own plane [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3446.28s)]
*  so I know that sounds a little bit like a flex but [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3451.32s)]
*  Were you were you in formation with air force one were you like? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3454.92s)]
*  You know just right behind it or on your own travel you were on your own travel schedule [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3459.0s)]
*  I was I was doing my own my own thing [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3463.1600000000003s)]
*  But did you have the option to go on air force one? [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3464.92s)]
*  I probably could have if I wanted to but I actually wanted to get the region a little bit early because I hadn't been before [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3467.0s)]
*  And I kind of checked it out and so I was waiting there when the president arrived. Oh wow [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3471.6400000000003s)]
*  So it's your first time in the region. Yeah. Well, tell us about your impressions generally and uh, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3476.04s)]
*  What were you trying to accomplish there as the czar? Well, I call it ai diplomacy [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3481.4s)]
*  First of all, these countries are obviously they're very resource rich. They've got a lot of [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3485.72s)]
*  Capital to deploy and they're also very interested in diversifying their economies [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3492.04s)]
*  They're very interested in high tech and they want to do things in ai [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3496.2s)]
*  They've got very significant aspirations there [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3499.48s)]
*  And so I was over there just to kind of listen to learn and see what they're interested in doing [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3502.52s)]
*  And I also got to see some of their tech scenes [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3507.56s)]
*  And just oh you went to digital garage in riad, right? I've been there. Oh, you've been there. Okay [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3510.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3515.08s)]
*  No, it's um [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3515.56s)]
*  They are really pushing entrepreneurship trying to generate more ideas and teach people how to start companies and [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3516.76s)]
*  Coworking spaces all kinds of incentives in terms of visas to come to riad to come to uae, you know, dubai [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3523.2200000000003s)]
*  Abu dhabi specifically so yeah, right [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3530.28s)]
*  I'm curious your impression of the individuals who are leading a lot of these different groups. Yeah, I was really taken back by [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3532.28s)]
*  How much time they had spent in the west it seemed like every single person I had met [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3541.0s)]
*  had taken one of these scholarships to go to oxford to harvard to [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3545.88s)]
*  You know caltech whatever it was. They all had spent massive amounts of time in the west and then come back to either saudi or uae or [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3550.52s)]
*  Oman, etc. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the people in their knowledge base [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3557.96s)]
*  Motivation, etc [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3563.48s)]
*  I had the same observation the elites of all these countries have all been educated in the west usually in the united states some in [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3564.76s)]
*  The uk the leadership tends to be young visionary [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3571.4s)]
*  Future-oriented intensely interested in ai like I was saying and they want to do big things in ai [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3575.86s)]
*  The thing that that's been in their way is that in october 2023 the biden administration [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3582.92s)]
*  Basically put a blanket on the whole region [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3589.6400000000003s)]
*  Acquiring semiconductors gpus and it it required that every [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3592.6800000000003s)]
*  export of a gpu or a server that contains a gpu had to get a specific license [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3599.0s)]
*  From the commerce department and I put a major damper on their efforts to do things like build data centers in the region [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3605.6400000000003s)]
*  Or to have their own local ai efforts. So they've been kind of in this holding pattern where [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3612.6s)]
*  The biden administration decided to kind of alienate them and you know, it wasn't just ai [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3617.64s)]
*  There was other things too remember the fist bump and the biden administration was very i'd say hostile [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3621.64s)]
*  standoffish cool to and even hostile towards [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3628.1s)]
*  these states in the region and I think from a geopolitical standpoint, it was just stupid because [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3631.88s)]
*  We're in an intense competition a high tech competition security competition economic competition with china [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3637.48s)]
*  And these states want to be aligned with the u.s [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3643.8799999999997s)]
*  And we're pushing them into china's arms and if we don't give them the ability to buy the american tech stack [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3646.12s)]
*  It's not like they're gonna sit on their hands and do nothing. They're gonna be forced to buy the chinese tech stack [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3652.52s)]
*  They're gonna participate one way or the other right and china still has some limitations on how many chips it can produce but they [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3657.72s)]
*  Clearly are building their own chinese tech stack. It's a huawei plus deep sea tech stack [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3664.3599999999997s)]
*  There's actually a story in malaysia just in the last couple of days where they were talking about [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3669.7999999999997s)]
*  Building a local data center using the huawei ascend gpu plus deep seek and then they walk back that story because [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3675.24s)]
*  I think they're afraid of getting in trouble with with the u.s government [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3683.56s)]
*  But the point is that if we drive [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3686.6s)]
*  These countries away if we alienate them they will end up partnering with china and so the united states [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3689.4s)]
*  I don't understand how that's in the united states's interest [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3694.12s)]
*  now [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3697.32s)]
*  As part of this trip we rolled out a new [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3698.44s)]
*  framework for an ai acceleration partnership with these countries [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3701.48s)]
*  And there's a few very important terms that I think it's worth going into so so first of all the the purpose of the framework [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3704.84s)]
*  Is to replace the biden export control to the region [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3711.48s)]
*  With a framework that gives them the ability to buy gpus and build data centers [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3716.2000000000003s)]
*  But there's a few very important provisions number one is there's a matching investment provision [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3720.76s)]
*  So [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3725.1600000000003s)]
*  For every dollar of investment they make in terms of building out data centers in the region they have to [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3725.96s)]
*  Invest a dollar in the united states and building out our ai infrastructure [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3731.32s)]
*  So it's a huge win for the united states in terms of accelerating our own [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3735.5600000000004s)]
*  Infrastructure build out so that's point number one number two is even with respect to the data centers. They're going to build in the region [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3739.1400000000003s)]
*  At least 80 of the chips have to be owned and operated by american [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3746.76s)]
*  Cloud service providers or american hyperscalers [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3751.3999999999996s)]
*  So even with respect to the data centers they're building the vast majority of the compute is going to be run by american [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3754.12s)]
*  companies [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3761.8599999999997s)]
*  And so I mean this to me is just a huge was there critique when people critiquing it like, uh, you know this [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3763.08s)]
*  Expansion I guess rocon has said like hey, we should build more data centers here. That was sort of a light critique maybe [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3768.9199999999996s)]
*  Or a misunderstanding. There's two types of critiques [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3774.52s)]
*  One is the one that that ro was making and ro's a friend [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3776.76s)]
*  But just you know, I respond to him on on x which is we are building out data centers in the u.s [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3779.8s)]
*  We want to do as much as we can [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3785.0s)]
*  It's the trump administration's policy towards energy that's making that possible [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3786.92s)]
*  We're making it easier to spin up new power generation [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3791.0s)]
*  And we're making it easier to permit both both those things were virtually impossible during the biden administration [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3794.2000000000003s)]
*  So we are building more here in the u.s [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3799.5600000000004s)]
*  in addition to that you've got these countries who are [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3802.6000000000004s)]
*  Resource rich and they have their own ai dreams and aspirations and we can either partner with them or drive them into the arms of [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3805.64s)]
*  China and the deal we've made is to enable their aspirations while getting them to fund [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3811.8s)]
*  More ai infrastructure in the united states and even the infrastructure they're building over there [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3816.44s)]
*  First of all, it's going to be on an american tech stack, right? [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3820.76s)]
*  We want it to be nvidia and amd and those types of companies that improves our balance of trade [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3823.48s)]
*  It also ensures that these data centers across the world are going to be built on american technology [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3828.76s)]
*  We want american technology become the standard of course [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3834.12s)]
*  And if you allow those data centers to be built on wall-a plus deep sea that will become the standard [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3837.56s)]
*  So I think this is something that people in silicon valley intuitively grasp [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3842.44s)]
*  But people in washington don't which is the way that you win [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3846.44s)]
*  These technology battles is you create the largest ecosystem, right? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3849.56s)]
*  You want to have the most partners you want to have the biggest app store [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3852.92s)]
*  You want to have the most data the most data power exactly [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3855.88s)]
*  So the point is we want to involve the whole world on our tech stack [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3859.72s)]
*  I think export controls on china that makes sense, but we don't want to reduce our market share in the rest of the world [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3864.3599999999997s)]
*  We want them getting hooked [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3869.64s)]
*  On our platforms making those platforms the standard and getting lock-in before china can catch up to us sacks [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3871.4s)]
*  Did jensen just say that he thought export controls were? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3877.8799999999997s)]
*  Kind of pointless. Did he just say that recently? Yeah, he's against all export controls and you know where I would [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3882.44s)]
*  Split the baby here is that? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3888.76s)]
*  I think that most people in washington believe that the export controls on china makes sense because we simply can't allow our most powerful [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3891.1600000000003s)]
*  Semiconductors to be to be used by china because of the dual use [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3899.38s)]
*  Now where I agree with jensen is that I think we should not place undue restrictions on the rest of the world [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3904.6800000000003s)]
*  Using the american tech stack because we will simply concede the market share to china [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3912.6800000000003s)]
*  And so I think he's right with respect to the middle east now the the other concern that you heard a lot [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3917.48s)]
*  Is around this quote diversion [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3922.6s)]
*  The idea that somehow the gpus or somehow the ip [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3926.76s)]
*  If we allow it to be used in data centers in the middle east will somehow find its way [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3930.84s)]
*  To china and yeah, I mean your expression on your face jacob shows that makes no sense [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3934.84s)]
*  Like these guys have unlimited resources. They have unlimited ambition. That's just a naive point of view [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3939.48s)]
*  They want these for themselves they understand the power of ai they don't want to give it to china [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3944.52s)]
*  They want it for themselves. They make trillions of dollars selling oil and gas. They don't need to smuggle our gpus [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3948.92s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. The other thing is that that people don't understand, you know, they're called chips [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3953.96s)]
*  But really these things are now the size of mainframes the invidia [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3957.88s)]
*  Data center product nvl 72 is this giant server cabinet. It's eight feet tall. It weighs 3600 pounds [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3962.0400000000004s)]
*  It's not like diamonds you smuggle in a briefcase, right? All you have to do is send you're not putting them up your butt [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3968.6000000000004s)]
*  Getting them across the board. That's definitely not happening [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3974.6800000000003s)]
*  No, it's not happening [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3977.7200000000003s)]
*  All you have to do is send an inspector to the data center to count the servers and you can see that they're there ridiculous [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3979.0800000000004s)]
*  So this idea that somehow they're going to get smuggled. It's like this totally fake concern that's been created [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3984.84s)]
*  It's almost like a totally fake narrative [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3989.32s)]
*  You know then people so well, they won't physically smuggle the servers [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3991.8s)]
*  But the ip will somehow be transferred to china look there's nothing in a data center that china hasn't already seen [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=3995.1600000000003s)]
*  They have one at least one of everything the issue is that they can't reverse [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4001.4s)]
*  The advanced semiconductors just from the chips, right? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4005.64s)]
*  Because it's about the process technology that it takes to create an advanced semiconductor [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4008.6s)]
*  There's hundreds even thousands of steps in that process [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4013.24s)]
*  And you can't figure out the recipe just by seeing the end product. I would like to say that i'm very proud of my bestie [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4016.52s)]
*  I got three calls [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4022.2s)]
*  I do want to tell you sax you crushed it. I think you yeah, it was pretty impressive put your best foot forward and [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4024.52s)]
*  People were really impressed [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4031.24s)]
*  But I got calls. I got three calls from the powers at b [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4033.48s)]
*  They were very psyched to meet you and spend time with you and they thought you were super impressive. So [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4036.12s)]
*  It was awesome. Thank you for doing that. I appreciate that. Yeah, it's an incredible region [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4042.04s)]
*  I think you're doing like a really patriotic thing if you look at that region [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4046.36s)]
*  Like you said it could tip one way or the other they could be involved with the west [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4050.2799999999997s)]
*  They we could be building businesses together and if we build businesses together [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4054.36s)]
*  That's better than them building businesses [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4059.1s)]
*  With china pretty obvious. I think I mean totally and this is the thing [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4062.46s)]
*  Is I just don't get the opposition of washington to this and I especially don't get how the opponents of this can call themselves [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4066.22s)]
*  China hawks because at the end of the day [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4072.14s)]
*  This is a tech battle between the u.s [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4074.46s)]
*  And china and we can have these countries be aligned with us and in our orbit or we could push them [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4076.3799999999997s)]
*  Into the arms of the chinese the choice is do we want these countries to be the piggy bank for american ai? [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4081.58s)]
*  Or for chinese ai it's like that's the same they have an investment level that they can do that dwarfs [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4086.9399999999996s)]
*  Anybody else in the world with the exception of norway in the united states [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4093.8999999999996s)]
*  I mean they can put a lot of money to work and here's the thing they want to [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4096.86s)]
*  It just hit the wire that open ai is partnering on a five gigawatt data center cluster in abu dhabi with g 42 [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4100.38s)]
*  Well, hold on. Let's just be clear about so the the five gigawatt cluster or it's more of a campus [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4106.78s)]
*  That's going to support many [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4112.780000000001s)]
*  American hyperscalers and cloud service providers and they're going to be one of the tenants [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4114.54s)]
*  So I think they're saying that they're going to have one gigawatt. There's still four gigawatts to go that they plan on supporting [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4119.26s)]
*  Well, well the the most interesting part of the deal it said was that as part of the deal g 42 plans to make a reciprocal [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4125.42s)]
*  Dollar for dollar investment in ai infrastructure in the u.s. So to your point sax it's like perfect [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4131.9800000000005s)]
*  Cooperating like this. I think just makes a ton of sense [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4137.56s)]
*  Absolutely, and this is not dumb money, by the way [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4140.38s)]
*  These are very smart people who are investing very strategically with a very crisp, you know group of individuals [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4143.099999999999s)]
*  Like you said who have been educated in the west, you know when people explain to me [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4149.74s)]
*  Oh, yeah, just go to abu dhabi and come back with a suitcase full of money [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4153.26s)]
*  No, these are folks who want to be on the board of companies. They want to company build [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4156.94s)]
*  They see themselves as owners in business not just investors and then they want to do it domestically and abroad [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4161.099999999999s)]
*  The amount of investment that they're going to do in the next 30 years is going to dwarf [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4167.5s)]
*  What we see out of universities and retirement accounts are people understand the scale of what's happening? [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4172.62s)]
*  This is why I just don't understand the point of the biden policy of alienating these countries and making them feel [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4177.9s)]
*  Uneasy about their place because you don't know who it was that made the decision [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4185.24s)]
*  Let's face it that guy was confused [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4191.42s)]
*  We can have bernies [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4193.66s)]
*  I've actually have a pretty good idea at this point of who was controlling the auto pen on ai [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4195.18s)]
*  There was a group of very powerful staffers in the biden administration about half a dozen people who kind of controlled ai policy [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4199.82s)]
*  And the interesting thing is none of them have ever worked in silicon valley [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4206.3s)]
*  They're all basically lawyers and they don't really have a good understanding of the idea of a platform or a technology ecosystem [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4210.38s)]
*  or a stack and I don't think they realized that by [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4217.26s)]
*  alienating [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4221.88s)]
*  these very [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4223.34s)]
*  Resource rich countries that they were creating a huge opportunity for china to come in and serve the region [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4225.34s)]
*  And this is why I think this you know again what I call ai diplomacy is so important is it boxes out china [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4231.34s)]
*  It's good for america. It's good for our companies. It's good for our trade balance [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4236.860000000001s)]
*  It makes us the standard and it boxes out china [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4240.3s)]
*  What's not to like about this? I really don't get it [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4243.74s)]
*  You know, I think they were living in a world where they put people into very rigid buckets [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4246.38s)]
*  If you wanted to look at human rights as an issue, which I think is what some people were doing in that administration [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4251.58s)]
*  I look at the progress that's being made and if you go to these societies and you look at what's happening in that region [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4257.74s)]
*  the pace at which human rights and [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4264.22s)]
*  Individual freedoms is growing and the rate at which those societies are moving forward. It's going in the right direction [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4267.42s)]
*  So what do we want to do? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4273.26s)]
*  Do we want to steer people towards collaboration and working together to build the future or do you want to have it devolve? [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4274.14s)]
*  I mean such a stupid decision by the biden administration. It's perplexing. Yeah, I I really don't get it [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4280.219999999999s)]
*  I I don't understand what the point of alienating these gulf states was [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4285.42s)]
*  Well, I like trump's approach there when he said listen, you're gonna make decisions in your own time [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4290.46s)]
*  That's what they want to hear. They want to be respected as they respect us. Hey, we're gonna make decisions in our own time [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4296.139999999999s)]
*  What's right for our people? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4301.26s)]
*  That's a process that will decide [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4302.78s)]
*  Now if you want to collaborate on building a company a data center a technology platform. Hey, we're here for that [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4304.78s)]
*  But you can't tell us how to run our society and just like we wouldn't want them to come here and tell us how [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4310.3s)]
*  To run our society, right? [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4314.7s)]
*  So I agree with what you just said jay cal and I thought the best part of the president's speech [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4316.3s)]
*  Which the whole thing was excellent [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4320.86s)]
*  but the best part was when he talked about how the neocons and the interventionists had come into the region and lectured people [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4322.139999999999s)]
*  And come in with this very moralistic point of view and made all these interventions that basically wrecked countries [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4329.26s)]
*  And it's it wasn't the the neocons the interventionists who have led to so much progress in the middle east and in the arab world [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4335.5s)]
*  It's been the countries themselves [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4341.98s)]
*  Whose own leaders have set the the path and have had the vision that was an incredible speech. It was incredible [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4343.98s)]
*  That was pretty trump for me. Yeah, he did a great job [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4351.66s)]
*  credit what [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4354.22s)]
*  And that's the message they've wanted to hear for a long time and that's the message that moves society forward [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4355.42s)]
*  All these other messages just sort of set it back and um, I think i'm super hopeful about the region [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4361.179999999999s)]
*  Okay, let's do science corner. You know, well by the way, I just I was just checking. Um [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4366.139999999999s)]
*  x here and it looks like there is a um [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4370.78s)]
*  announcement on what the [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4374.679999999999s)]
*  Open ai device is going to be oh, you see this here we go [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4376.62s)]
*  Oh the pox the little puck I saw that puck but it hasn't been confirmed yet [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4380.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, is it a puck you put on your desk and it yeah, it's like a puck with a camera and a hole for a mic [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4383.98s)]
*  Oh, that's a pin. Yeah, that's a pendant. It's a pendant. I could have made 10 straight up versus you and then that's a puck [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4388.38s)]
*  It fits in the palm of your hand. It's too small to be a puck a puck size your hand [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4395.74s)]
*  It looks like your thumb. Okay. This is ai generate. It's not actually the device [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4400.06s)]
*  They haven't shown the device from johnny i yet. Somebody just took what's in the wall street journal report [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4404.54s)]
*  They mocked it up. This is their best guess as to what it might look like [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4409.58s)]
*  This is already out [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4413.9800000000005s)]
*  And by the way, this is going to get you punched in the face you show up with a listening device to a party or a meeting [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4415.58s)]
*  I'm gonna knock you out. This is ridiculous and it's got a camera in it, too [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4421.18s)]
*  I don't want this surveillance device anywhere near me. How are you gonna do it like this? [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4424.94s)]
*  Get that puck away from me [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4433.34s)]
*  How dare you record me violating my privacy [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4438.46s)]
*  I was literally at dinner the other day I kid you not and somebody came up with one of these things and it was [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4441.34s)]
*  Clipped on his thing. I said hey, what's the thing on your lapel? He said it's an ai recording device. It does [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4446.14s)]
*  It summarizes what we're doing. I said he goes. Oh, do you care? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4451.9s)]
*  I said do you care if I punch you in the face for covertly recording me and he said yes [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4455.66s)]
*  I said well then turn it turn it off [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4459.5s)]
*  I mean literally let's talk about science. Let's talk about science. Well, you raise a good point jay cal that these [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4462.06s)]
*  I'm sure these devices [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4467.66s)]
*  These new devices [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4470.94s)]
*  Requires a level of trust that is kind of unprecedented [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4473.26s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you already had to trust [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4476.94s)]
*  You know google and iphone and so on because they do have a huge level of access to your data [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4478.94s)]
*  But the new let's call them ai connected devices. I mean they are [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4483.9s)]
*  surveillance devices, I mean their whole point is to listen and see everything that you can hear and see and [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4488.3s)]
*  You know and then to give that data to ai to do something with and man you better trust that company completely [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4496.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah, which company's doing it. Oh, right that company. Yeah [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4502.3s)]
*  The company that had every leader leave because they didn't trust [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4506.14s)]
*  The founder. Okay. All right. Yeah, go ahead and wear the puck and by the way with these parts [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4510.14s)]
*  I'm gonna make one more point for you berg. I'm sorry [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4514.38s)]
*  These devices need to have a red flashing diode on them when they're recording [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4516.22s)]
*  We need to pass legislation that it does that if it's recording it should have a flashing red light on it [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4520.46s)]
*  Let's go to science corner because everybody at your mouth loves science corner free berg some breaking news some [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4525.26s)]
*  Innovations in crisper. Yes, it's got a lot of press coverage [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4532.360000000001s)]
*  But there is a baby born named kj in the research paper that was published [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4535.58s)]
*  was born with [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4541.58s)]
*  A mutation that was inherited from the mother on a specific gene called cps1 [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4544.06s)]
*  And the same mutation inherited from the father which resulted in the fact that this gene has a deficiency in it [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4549.52s)]
*  cps1 [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4556.860000000001s)]
*  Produces a protein that's part of the urea cycle. So basically breaking down [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4558.72s)]
*  Nitrogen or protein compounds in the blood so that they can be excreted and in the absence of this protein [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4563.660000000001s)]
*  If this protein is not being made in the body [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4569.84s)]
*  Ammonia accumulates in the blood and that has extraordinarily harmful consequences including brain damage and ultimately death this gene [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4572.72s)]
*  had a g [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4581.04s)]
*  That was mutated into an a [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4582.88s)]
*  on both of the copies of the gene [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4585.28s)]
*  Meant that the protein wasn't being correctly produced and as a result the breakdown of nitrogen [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4588.16s)]
*  And ammonia was not possible [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4595.84s)]
*  And so this leads to a very short life [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4598.32s)]
*  For the very very very very few people that have ever had this double mutation that this particular child was unfortunately born with [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4601.6s)]
*  So we have technology today crisper gene editing technology [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4608.8s)]
*  In fact crisper gene editing technology is what we use to do some of the work we do at ohalo the company I run [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4612.16s)]
*  And some advanced forms of gene editing technology include what are called base editors where you can change a single letter [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4618.88s)]
*  On a strand of dna into another letter. So in this particular case changing an a to a g was the goal [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4625.5199999999995s)]
*  So the physician rebecca arrens nicholas giving her a big shout out for the incredible work [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4632.48s)]
*  She did in partnership with scientists at the university of pennsylvania [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4636.88s)]
*  They developed very quickly [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4640.8s)]
*  a very specific [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4643.44s)]
*  gene editing target to go in and find the letter a and turn it to g [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4645.36s)]
*  In this particular patient's body [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4651.36s)]
*  Now remember we have the same dna in all of our cells in our body [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4653.839999999999s)]
*  But specific cells have specific functions and genes are expressed in only those cells [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4657.28s)]
*  So in this case, it's the liver that makes this the cps1 protein [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4663.44s)]
*  And so they had to get the gene editing into the liver cells to edit the liver cells [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4669.28s)]
*  And if they could edit the liver cells, then those liver cells would start to become more functional and you would have a functional protein [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4673.44s)]
*  So they quickly tested dozens of base editors. These are different proteins that can go in and edit [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4680.08s)]
*  They tested different guide rnase [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4686.08s)]
*  These are the guides that tell that editing protein where to go what part of the dna to go to which is trying to get it [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4688.16s)]
*  To this exact same site. They tested it in petri dishes [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4693.36s)]
*  Then they tested it in mice then in monkeys to make sure that the selection that they came up with worked [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4696.639999999999s)]
*  They then put it in the child [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4702.4s)]
*  And so basically by putting it in the blood found its way into the liver and that's the the the fortunate benefit here [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4704.4s)]
*  Was at the end of the day you're trying to edit specific cells and we can get to the liver [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4711.839999999999s)]
*  By putting crisper and the guide into the blood it made its way to the liver and they coded the gene editing [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4716.5599999999995s)]
*  System with liquid nanoparticles which helped it get into the cells. It got absorbed by the liver [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4723.12s)]
*  It got went into the cells. It found its way to the site on the dna. That's amazing converted the a to g [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4728.08s)]
*  And as a result those liver cells became functional to make the protein that breaks down the ammonia in the child's blood [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4733.92s)]
*  And so they did the first one just to make sure the child would handle it it worked [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4740.96s)]
*  The child didn't have any adverse effects. They then did the second dose [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4744.56s)]
*  Able to take the child off some of the medicines and compounds they were giving the child [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4748.08s)]
*  To break down ammonia in the blood and then they gave it the third dose and they're monitoring [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4752.16s)]
*  So this is the first time that we've seen this kind of custom crisper [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4756.08s)]
*  Gene editing for a genetic mutation being applied to a patient [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4760.5599999999995s)]
*  In vivo in the blood for a specific target for a specific particular [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4764.4s)]
*  Treatment. I just asked grock how many diseases [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4769.5199999999995s)]
*  Are because of an a to g point mutation and it says it's hard to estimate through the human [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4774.08s)]
*  genome database or clinvar [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4780.8s)]
*  But it estimated between 20 and 30 thousand conditions are because of an a to g point mutation [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4783.04s)]
*  And isn't that incredible? Yeah, and i'll tell you one other story about this [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4789.04s)]
*  I saw a geneticist here at ucsf a couple years ago [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4794.16s)]
*  And he was telling me about all of these kids that come in and they don't know what's wrong with them [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4798.0s)]
*  And he can see on the kid's face. He can see a disease condition [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4803.12s)]
*  They have all these weird lab tests and the kids are dying or they're really deficient in some way [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4806.320000000001s)]
*  And they can't afford to do the dna sequencing because the child is on medical or some other sort of like healthcare plan [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4811.280000000001s)]
*  And it costs like five thousand dollars to do the dna sequencing needed to figure out [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4817.28s)]
*  What genetic mutation this particular child has so there aren't easy off-the-shelf targeted tests or lab tests you can run [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4821.68s)]
*  To figure out when people have genetic disease [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4828.88s)]
*  And so this is an incredible like undiscovered set of problems to come off to your point [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4831.28s)]
*  That there are likely millions of people out there that have some health condition [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4836.64s)]
*  That they've not yet been able to identify because it's a genetic mutation and not everyone can afford to go out [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4840.64s)]
*  And just get their genome sequence to figure out where the mutation might lie in their body [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4845.92s)]
*  And so as we discover more and more genetic mutations [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4850.320000000001s)]
*  We build targeted tests for identifying that people have them and hopefully over time can start to build more targeted therapies like this one [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4852.8s)]
*  To go after and make the changes at specific sites to fix the the genetic mutations [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4860.4800000000005s)]
*  Bad ass it's incredible. Okay, somebody wake sax up sax [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4865.34s)]
*  Yeah [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4870.0s)]
*  Just so you know one thing about america is we've got a pretty good advantage in gene editing technology today [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4871.2s)]
*  And china is on its way coming after the us on this technology front as well as ai you woke him up [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4876.96s)]
*  You should peak this interest china's coming for uranus and you will see some very good [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4882.48s)]
*  hosts recently on people talking about how a lot of [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4887.28s)]
*  Technology that's been developed in the united states is being transferred to china and they are building biotech companies and biotech solutions [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4890.54s)]
*  That take american ip and put them into market and this has also had a very big dampening effect on the biotech market [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4897.5199999999995s)]
*  So what do you think we should do about that? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4903.44s)]
*  It should be in the trade negotiations some tighter ip controls. I can tell you sax that a very large company [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4906.24s)]
*  I had a conversation with their ceo [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4913.28s)]
*  And they said this exact thing which is that the amount of ip that's available for purchase or for licensing [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4915.599999999999s)]
*  Is it a good thing? [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4921.22s)]
*  Questionable provenance but how effective and good it is [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4924.26s)]
*  Is causing them to figure out how to establish more of a presence to just buy stuff there [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4928.26s)]
*  It's kind of like very what does that mean? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4932.740000000001s)]
*  Meaning that let's just say you have an rnd effort in the united states. You can almost head your bets by having [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4934.900000000001s)]
*  An outpost in or near china. Let's say hong kong [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4941.22s)]
*  Where there's an equivalent project for almost anything that we're working on [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4945.06s)]
*  There at the same time in real time and so if you can't figure out how to get it here you can get it there [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4949.22s)]
*  And it's much murkier and the the laws are sort of unclear and it's just different enough where you can kind of [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4955.54s)]
*  Get to the same place. So it's just to say what freebrook said which is that [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4962.9800000000005s)]
*  The amount of rnd that the chinese are doing is roughly equivalent to the amount of rnd that the united states is doing [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4967.7s)]
*  Yeah [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4973.46s)]
*  And so as a result everything that we discover they discover and so it really is a foot race and we're kind of neck and neck [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4974.42s)]
*  For sure. This is a perfect time to make sure that we have an electricity deficit [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4981.9400000000005s)]
*  Perfect time. Well, I agree that you need to build out power, but I think the administration's committed to doing that drill baby drill [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4987.06s)]
*  I'm not questioning trump's desire. I'm talking about the actual congressional bill details [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4993.38s)]
*  I saw yesterday the tennessee valley authority filed the first ever application for small modular reactor. Let's go [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=4998.5s)]
*  Hopefully it gets approved very quickly. This is by the way, I I will watch this [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5005.9400000000005s)]
*  I think others should watch this to see how quickly [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5009.7s)]
*  They're able to get through the regulatory process to get that thing approved and that will be a very good indicator if it gets approved [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5012.34s)]
*  And they can get fast permitting fast deployment [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5017.62s)]
*  That would be an incredible insight on how quickly the u.s will be able to scale power production for ai over under 20 32 [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5020.26s)]
*  What actually let's do a poly market great. Yeah, let's do a poly market and let's you should create a special [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5026.58s)]
*  Trump designation like a speed run designation when something's super important [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5032.900000000001s)]
*  He puts the speed run designation on it and they they actually attempt to do it as fast as possible [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5036.82s)]
*  I don't know if you guys watched my interview with bergam, but he said that there's a permit for a copper mine [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5041.860000000001s)]
*  That's been outstanding for 30 years. They've been trying to get through the permitting process 30 years to get this copper mines [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5046.42s)]
*  Started to run and now he and the team are trying to fast track this thing but 30 years it's been sitting through [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5053.38s)]
*  The vanilla folder has made its way down the elevator [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5059.06s)]
*  So it's down there in the sub basement ready to be shipped [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5061.780000000001s)]
*  But let's go ahead and get rid of those. Let's get rid of those and keep things [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5065.780000000001s)]
*  Let me ask freeberg. Yeah. Well, I don't want to get rid of those, but let me ask freeberg question [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5069.38s)]
*  No, i'm joking. I'm like, yeah, I know given the amazing advances that you see coming with crisper biotech, but also ai robotics [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5073.620000000001s)]
*  What are the odds that we can grow our way out of this fiscal problem? Yeah [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5081.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5088.04s)]
*  I do i i'll be honest. I think the limiting fact so the crisper side [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5089.639999999999s)]
*  Is going to have profound effects in longevity human health and food abundance [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5094.2s)]
*  So those are like I think about abundance in four ways [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5097.719999999999s)]
*  One is abundance of food or calories one is in abundance of labor through automation [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5101.48s)]
*  One is in abundance of lifespan or longevity and one is an abundance of what I think is the most important and gating factor [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5107.32s)]
*  Which is energy which leads to everything else [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5114.04s)]
*  So you can't have the labor savings without the energy and the productivity improvements without the energy [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5116.28s)]
*  So the thing I do watch the mosacs and that I do think you know [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5120.28s)]
*  I've talked about this that I do think is the critical linchpin for all of those other points of abundance being unleashed is the energy [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5123.16s)]
*  Equation and this is where I look very clearly and plainly at what china's doing versus where we're at today [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5129.22s)]
*  We've got stated intentions, but the actions are where we're still [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5135.639999999999s)]
*  You know, we got to start showing up. That's it. But let's assume that we have enough power [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5139.16s)]
*  I mean my point's really about [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5143.4s)]
*  Yeah, if we have enough power the 38 trillion of debt doesn't matter really you're saying that in a no i'm very very serious way [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5145.799999999999s)]
*  That's a pretty that's a pretty important [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5153.08s)]
*  conclusion because if that's true [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5155.86s)]
*  And we can grow our way out of this problem [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5158.679999999999s)]
*  Then that's an alternative to having this austerity approach where there's you're right for which there's no political [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5162.12s)]
*  You're right [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5167.24s)]
*  Sax listen if I saw us adding a terawatt of electricity production capacity per year in the u.s [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5168.679999999999s)]
*  I would shut the fuck up about the debt [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5173.24s)]
*  I wouldn't [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5175.88s)]
*  Terawatt we're talking about gigawatts [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5177.0s)]
*  Yeah, i'm talking about one terawatt. No, I know but i'm saying like china you guys know china right now dealing in in gigawatts [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5179.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I know [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5186.84s)]
*  We barely have a terawatt and china's dealing in terawatts china is moving. I know I mean we've been through the numbers but they're going [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5187.64s)]
*  They're adding [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5194.12s)]
*  an entire [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5195.96s)]
*  United states every 18 months every 18 months [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5197.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5200.200000000001s)]
*  So every 18 months china adds all of the power production capacity of the entire united states additional to their grid [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5200.76s)]
*  Mostly in nuclear and solar solar is a big component hydro [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5207.72s)]
*  Hydro, I mean look at the look at the number of times they're adding like [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5212.04s)]
*  Hundreds of gigawatts [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5216.280000000001s)]
*  Just on the on the yangtze. Yeah, look at the number of times that elon has said this like it's like the amount of [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5218.360000000001s)]
*  Energy that's available if we just harness it from the sun and redirect it [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5223.88s)]
*  With some storage would solve all of our problems. But the problem is that we're at like just a little over a terawatt [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5228.68s)]
*  We're inching along in gigawatts [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5235.8s)]
*  Whereas china is in the terawatts adding terawatts [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5238.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they're at the same [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5242.780000000001s)]
*  There are three [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5245.26s)]
*  Or utah there's like a little three going to eight and we're at one going to two [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5247.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, i've shown this many times before on this show crazy. This is in this is total production over a year [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5251.5s)]
*  So this is terawatt hours and the show is 4 000 terawatt hours is where the u.s is at [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5257.26s)]
*  If you break that down on basically a continuous production you measure it in watts [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5263.1s)]
*  So the number of watts that the u.s can make in any given point in time is making any given point in time is [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5267.98s)]
*  One terawatt one trillion watts. Meanwhile right now china is making [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5272.139999999999s)]
*  Three terawatts and they're scaling up to make eight. We are at one going to two over the next 15 years [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5276.78s)]
*  So you consider this graph to be more important than the the budget deficit graph I do [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5285.58s)]
*  And i'll tell you why um, i've got another chart. I can pull it up for next time [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5292.139999999999s)]
*  So now do you think it's esoteric sax to like add these line items I this market [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5295.42s)]
*  Well, I don't I just I mean you're talking about I just i'm not sure [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5300.9400000000005s)]
*  You're gonna have to provide a lot more information about what exactly is no, but I mean look [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5305.5s)]
*  It's obvious that it's field and blackstone. They'll tell you and I just want to translate this [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5310.14s)]
*  It's so obvious that as you're reporting on that chamoth. I just haven't seen anything [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5314.62s)]
*  It just happened last night. This is the point i'll just say one thing because I think it's I just want to add it at the end [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5318.46s)]
*  Automation [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5324.14s)]
*  Which is unlocked by ai we are going to see an explosion of robots. They're not going to all be humanoid robots, but like robotics [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5325.42s)]
*  Allows humans to get an incredible amount of work done. Imagine having the cost to build a giant building [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5332.46s)]
*  Go down by 50x. That's what this unlock unleashes is all of this automation optimist doing it [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5339.1s)]
*  Yes, we'll have optimists, but we'll have these robotic devices doing it. You can see it in china [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5344.54s)]
*  Go look at how they build bridges [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5348.46s)]
*  It takes like three days to build a multi-mile bridge in china because the whole thing is automated [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5349.98s)]
*  They do automated drilling they do automated mining they do automated building [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5354.7s)]
*  All of that if we unleash that capacity in the united states [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5358.459999999999s)]
*  We can build things that are economically productive for america. All of this gets unleashed the technology is here today [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5361.66s)]
*  The only thing that's missing is the power we want this [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5368.299999999999s)]
*  David I would just then ask folks go talk to like duke energy go talk to consolation energy go talk to the [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5371.339999999999s)]
*  The drillers, but they'll all tell you the same thing if you want a nat gas turbine [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5377.98s)]
*  We have to wait until 2030 [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5383.42s)]
*  Why because china owns them all they make them all so if you say hey chumov drill baby drill and use nat gas [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5385.82s)]
*  And I say, okay [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5392.14s)]
*  I'm waiting in line for five years to get a turbine. So then it's like, okay. What can I do nuclear? I can't [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5393.5s)]
*  Because that'll take till 2035 [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5399.82s)]
*  So then i'm like, okay [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5402.299999999999s)]
*  I'll go into the tax equity markets and i'll finance myself residential or industrial solar [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5403.259999999999s)]
*  And when that goes away, there is no energy somebody should just go and figure this out [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5408.299999999999s)]
*  By the way, this is our manhattan project. This there was a manhattan project then there was the apollo project [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5413.0199999999995s)]
*  This generation's manhattan and apollo project is energy production scaling in the united states. That's it [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5418.219999999999s)]
*  All the other things flows. We don't need the government to do ai. We don't need the government to do automation [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5423.82s)]
*  Let us let us do the energy [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5429.259999999999s)]
*  Energy and you can't decapitate the markets at finances that we're all willing to put up the risk capital [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5431.82s)]
*  That's the crazy part. We don't even need the government [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5436.54s)]
*  I don't know any of the details of what chumov's talking about but I mean generally like I do think and your chairman dictator [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5438.38s)]
*  Chumov pia haptia so they're saying ductator [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5443.66s)]
*  Yeah, chairman ductator who you ducted for your chairman dictator. I'm trying to close the show for the seventh time [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEZWyC-jJa4&t=5447.0199999999995s)]
