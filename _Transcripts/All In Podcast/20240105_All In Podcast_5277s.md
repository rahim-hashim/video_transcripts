# E160 2024 Predictions! Markets, tech, politics, and more
**All In Podcast:** [January 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics)
*  I found out about a free bird purchase that is just you were there tomorrow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=0.0s)]
*  You heard what he bought. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  What did I buy pickles? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=6.88s)]
*  The quinoa? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=7.92s)]
*  What was no no, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=8.48s)]
*  Sachs, you missed this because you're you are a sunbird now and the rest of us are snowbirds [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=10.24s)]
*  over the holidays. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=15.6s)]
*  But the three of us have been hanging out skiing, having dinner for a couple of weeks. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=16.32s)]
*  And we had a little wives dinner. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=21.04s)]
*  And one of the wives was complaining about the suits. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=22.8s)]
*  Free birds purchasing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=25.92s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=27.76s)]
*  So free birdgers. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=29.2s)]
*  Do you have pictures of the radiation suits? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=30.72s)]
*  I don't have pictures of the radiation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=32.56s)]
*  You're trying to find radiation suits. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=34.0s)]
*  I thought you're going to talk about like Brioni suits or something. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=36.96s)]
*  No radiation suits. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=40.24s)]
*  You know how you went into full scale panic mode and you during COVID and you had your whole [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=41.6s)]
*  outfit. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=45.36s)]
*  You're here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  You're here has Matt suit. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=46.88s)]
*  Friedberg. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=49.28s)]
*  Just because he's panicked about nuclear proliferation has bought suits for his [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=50.96s)]
*  entire family. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=58.32s)]
*  Thousands of dollars of radiation suits and nuclear fallout. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  And he bought one for his dog. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=65.6s)]
*  Dog dogs, sorry dogs from Monty and Daisy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=68.24s)]
*  I should send you guys the photo of the bunker. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=72.48s)]
*  I mean, I've got it all taken care of. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  You need a bunker first, right? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=76.72s)]
*  I think that's underway as well. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=78.16s)]
*  How do you get to your bunker? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=79.6s)]
*  Freeberg with with the pilots that you'll be asking to leave their families? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=80.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=83.84s)]
*  Will you be protecting them with the guns that were stolen from your house? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=86.4s)]
*  At least you'll have the thousands of pickles you've made. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=91.36s)]
*  I didn't know Friedberg was a prepper. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=96.56s)]
*  Did you know this, Sax? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=98.64s)]
*  Because Sax has a little prepper. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=100.08000000000001s)]
*  No, Sax, Friedberg was howling because he was so mad. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=101.36s)]
*  He made like thousands and thousands of pickles and nobody would eat them, including himself. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=104.4s)]
*  Because they were so terrible. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=109.44s)]
*  You literally bought a radiation pod for your dogs. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so that's their air filter on the right so that they don't breathe in the nuclear fallout cloud. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  I kind of like the prepping. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Sax. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=122.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's good. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=123.2s)]
*  You guys don't understand. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=123.92s)]
*  There's a reason evolution happens in moments of what we call punctuated equilibrium. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  There's a massive event and certain things survive and then that becomes the proliferant [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=129.28s)]
*  species going forward. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=135.28s)]
*  This is the moment. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  Be ready. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=138.0s)]
*  So you're saying paranoid rich white guys are going to survive the nuclear holocaust, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=138.32s)]
*  is what you're saying. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=142.32s)]
*  Paranoid rich white tech guys are going to make it to the other side. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=143.84s)]
*  Got it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  How exciting. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=148.48s)]
*  What a great future. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  What a future, Tramont. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  Tramont and I are like, we'd rather die. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=152.95999999999998s)]
*  That touches my erogenous zones. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=154.88s)]
*  Just the idea that when Sax and Friedberg are the only two reproducing males left, delicious. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=156.72s)]
*  Can you imagine the gene pool? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=162.32s)]
*  It's like literally this is like some dystopian science fiction. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=164.56s)]
*  This is like a Black Mirror episode. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=167.44s)]
*  You'll have the pastiest preppers in the world. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=169.04s)]
*  Pasty preppers to inherit the earth. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=172.8s)]
*  Welcome back to the program, everybody. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=193.68s)]
*  It is the new year, but it's the same squad. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=195.28s)]
*  Your four besties are here. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=198.16s)]
*  Chamath Paliha Patiya. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=199.76s)]
*  He is now not just the dictator. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=201.76s)]
*  He is chairman dictator calling in from the slopes with his beautiful Burt sweater. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=204.56s)]
*  That's a great sweater. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=209.68s)]
*  It's a major turtleneck going on there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=210.64s)]
*  And we have David Friedberg. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=212.8s)]
*  Also looks like he's on the slopes and he is wearing his oh, hallo, his oh, hallo, not [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=214.88s)]
*  mahalo, oh, hallo hat. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=220.24s)]
*  He is branding here on the all in podcast sneaking a little branding for his new startup [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=222.4s)]
*  that he is the CEO of. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  David Sax is with us, of course, and he cleaned up. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=229.04s)]
*  He cleaned up a little bit here. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=232.48s)]
*  The hair was getting out of control. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=233.6s)]
*  We had a lot of commentary on the hair. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=235.12s)]
*  Apparently you cleaned up shop. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  I pivoted from the Jefferson to the gecko. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=238.32s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  So everybody loves when we do our predictions. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=241.76s)]
*  And so we're going to start off 2024. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=244.72s)]
*  Big year for us. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=247.12s)]
*  We have a lot going on here in All In. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=247.92s)]
*  And we're going to just do some predictions here. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=249.6s)]
*  So let's get started. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=251.84s)]
*  We're going to kick it off with Sax doing his prediction for the biggest political winner [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  in 2024. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=259.36s)]
*  Sax, who do you have? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=260.64s)]
*  What's your prediction for who's going to be the biggest winner in 2024? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=261.52s)]
*  We're bracing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=265.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=266.0s)]
*  Well, you're going to love this, J. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=266.24s)]
*  Cal, but my prediction for biggest political winner in 2024 is Vladimir Putin. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  2023 last year was the year that Putin turned it all around. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=274.64s)]
*  He stabilized his economy after the West's attempt to sanction him to his knees, tried [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=278.72s)]
*  to collapse his economy. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=284.8s)]
*  We issued basically an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=285.92s)]
*  He has gained the upper hand militarily in Ukraine. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=291.92s)]
*  I think that 2024 will be a year of him consolidating gains in Ukraine, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=295.36s)]
*  potentially making new gains. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  I think that the stalemate narrative that our media has propagated about Ukraine will [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=303.68s)]
*  be exposed as a lie. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=310.48s)]
*  I think the Russians are in fact winning that war. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=312.08s)]
*  And what you're seeing is that his successful stance against the West in Ukraine has only [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=314.48s)]
*  made him more influential throughout the Global South and in the BRICS countries, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  countries that oppose American dominance and dollar hegemony see him as the man with [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=325.68s)]
*  the plan, as a bit of a conquering hero. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  I think as Project Ukraine falls apart in 2024, it's only going to reinforce that sense [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  that he's the big winner. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=343.44s)]
*  Sax, did you see that Argentina said they're not going to join BRICS and that some have [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=345.36s)]
*  said that was a bit of a blowback on the BRICS effort to end dollar hegemony? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=350.08s)]
*  And do you think it's really impactful or is it just a one-off? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=356.8s)]
*  I think it's a one-off. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=359.84s)]
*  I mean, Mele won in a big surprise there because the country's economy has been such a [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=360.8s)]
*  basket case and he is very pro-American, pro-Israel, pro-West. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=366.64s)]
*  And so he has distanced Argentina from BRICS. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=372.15999999999997s)]
*  But I think that's a bit of a one-off. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=376.71999999999997s)]
*  The larger issue is that the whole Global South now is really resisting the collective [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=378.16s)]
*  West in a number of different ways. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=386.72s)]
*  And so our influence and dominance is slowly declining across the world. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=388.88000000000005s)]
*  And there's many examples of that. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=394.56s)]
*  So we can get into it throughout this show. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=395.92s)]
*  Just to be clear with the audience, you're not rooting for Putin here. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=398.0s)]
*  You're just predicting he's the biggest winner. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  I'm not rooting for it to happen. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=403.76000000000005s)]
*  I've got other answers here that I think are negatives as well. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=406.24s)]
*  I wish we had made a peace deal and avoided this whole Ukraine war. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  I think that was a gigantic mistake by the West. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=414.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=416.88s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=417.2s)]
*  You've been clear about that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  We have put Putin in this position to be the victor because we plunged into a war [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=418.88s)]
*  without thinking it through. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=426.24s)]
*  And the truth is we can't give Ukraine enough aid to have them actually win this war. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=428.0s)]
*  So we've contributed massively to Putin being this victor. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=434.24s)]
*  And it was Fiona Hill, who is a Russia hawk in the foreign policy establishment, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=437.6s)]
*  who pointed out in a speech, I think over the past year, that the Global South is using [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=443.52s)]
*  this Ukraine war as a proxy to rebel against the West. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=450.96s)]
*  So in the same way that we're using Ukraine as a proxy against Russia, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=454.48s)]
*  she said the Global South was using Russia as a proxy against the West [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=458.08s)]
*  as a way to basically dethrone American hegemony all over the world. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  And that's a very negative trend. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=467.59999999999997s)]
*  So if you had Ukraine and Putin in under seven minutes for this episode, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=469.84s)]
*  you bet the under, you win. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=473.68s)]
*  Freeberg, who's your prediction for the biggest political winner in politics for 2024? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=475.28s)]
*  I'm going to go with independent third party in the US. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=480.24s)]
*  We saw the stats last week. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=482.88s)]
*  I think we reviewed them with a poll that showed that 60 plus percent of people are [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=484.71999999999997s)]
*  claiming interest in a third party or an independent effort outside of the traditional [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=488.24s)]
*  damn Republican split. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  And if you look at in 1992, Ross Perot got 18 to 19 percent of the general election vote. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=496.0s)]
*  RFK Jr. is obviously running on an independent ticket this year. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=505.92s)]
*  We'll see if he can even get on the ballot in a bunch of states. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=508.8s)]
*  But I think that whether it's him or the interest in developing a third party [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=512.0s)]
*  in the US that there may be a big winner this year that challenges the traditional two party [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=518.16s)]
*  split in this country. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=524.24s)]
*  All right. And Shamath, what do you got for your biggest political winner in 2021? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=525.52s)]
*  Independent centrists. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=530.16s)]
*  I think this election starts the breakdown of the two party system. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=531.52s)]
*  Same, same. Look at that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=535.52s)]
*  RFK this week actually just got added to the Utah ballot. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=536.64s)]
*  I think that this could be the most meaningful, long lasting change that we see in American [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=539.2s)]
*  politics. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=543.9200000000001s)]
*  This is amazing. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=544.64s)]
*  From the RFK candidacy. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=545.84s)]
*  I mean, how many people do you guys know that were Republicans that don't want to be [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  Republicans anymore or were Democrats and don't want to be Democrats anymore? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=550.72s)]
*  It's really like most so many people. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=553.52s)]
*  I know more of the latter. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=555.52s)]
*  I know more of the latter than I do. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=557.36s)]
*  Right. Yeah, that's true, too. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=559.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I think. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=560.32s)]
*  I think Republicans are still firmly established. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=561.52s)]
*  I think people are embarrassed to be a Democrat right now. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=563.6s)]
*  Interestingly, I also picked the dark horse presidential candidate who will beat [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=566.16s)]
*  treasonous and corrupt, a.k.a. Trump and Biden. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=571.12s)]
*  I think we're going to actually see some dark horse candidate maybe beat these two in the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=573.44s)]
*  rematch that nobody wanted. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=578.6400000000001s)]
*  Wow, that's crazy. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=580.6400000000001s)]
*  Three of the four of us picked the same thing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=581.5200000000001s)]
*  No coordination beforehand. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=583.2s)]
*  Yes. And this is done blind, folks. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=585.0400000000001s)]
*  And Nick has my notes here so he can vouch for me here. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=586.8800000000001s)]
*  And just to go back and look at 2023, what we predicted. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=591.9200000000001s)]
*  Sachs, you said Asian American college applicants were going to be your biggest [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=595.5200000000001s)]
*  winner in politics. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=598.96s)]
*  That actually turned out to be pretty prescient, right? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I was betting on court cases overruling affirmative action, and that's [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=602.24s)]
*  exactly what happened is that Supreme Court ruled against affirmative action in college [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=607.2s)]
*  admissions, saying that it unlawfully discriminated against Asian Americans. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=611.84s)]
*  So, yeah, that worked out exactly right. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=616.16s)]
*  So that's a great prediction. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=618.16s)]
*  I think, Tramath, you had perhaps the best prediction of even the entire show last year. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=619.6s)]
*  Your spread trade, Long Nicky and Short DeSantis, that paid off in spades. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=626.16s)]
*  Well done there. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=629.76s)]
*  Freberg, you had MBS and Saudi have the most important year in their modern era. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=630.48s)]
*  That actually pretty prescient as well. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=634.88s)]
*  They seem to be. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=636.48s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, if you look at, let me just post this. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=637.12s)]
*  This was this journal article that came out in March, if you guys remember this, when [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=638.72s)]
*  Saudi was considering accepting Yuan instead of dollars for sales of oil to China. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=642.16s)]
*  And then in August, the US ramped up pressure on Saudi Arabia to sell oil in dollars, not [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=648.16s)]
*  Yuan. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=653.1999999999999s)]
*  Let me just pull this up for you guys, which was obviously the follow on story where the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=653.76s)]
*  US tried to counter the actions, which is continuing obviously today, where there's [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=658.9599999999999s)]
*  a back and forth. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=664.7199999999999s)]
*  And Saudi, as I mentioned last week, I think is in this really interesting central pivot [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  position between all of these competing major nuclear powers and fighting for influence. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=669.68s)]
*  And this is a big story and it will continue to be this year. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  And modernizing society. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=679.92s)]
*  That photo of the fist bump. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=681.5999999999999s)]
*  I mean, what a mistake that was, where Biden just gratuitously took the lead in the fight [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=683.5999999999999s)]
*  and then just basically insulted MBS. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  Compare that to the photo of Putin visiting the Middle East and meeting, shaking hands [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=691.36s)]
*  with MBS, which happened just a few weeks ago. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=696.64s)]
*  And compare the welcome that Putin got in Saudi Arabia and I think UAE to the welcome [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=699.84s)]
*  that Biden got. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=706.64s)]
*  It's just two completely different levels. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=707.52s)]
*  It was a very warm embrace on both sides. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=709.84s)]
*  I think it was UAE. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=712.4s)]
*  For him, where they had the colors of the Russian flag up everywhere. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=714.24s)]
*  So, you know, we've tried to portray Putin as this global pariah. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=719.9200000000001s)]
*  We've tried to turn him into this global pariah, but it's not working because of the [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=724.8000000000001s)]
*  way that he is defeating the collective West in Ukraine. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  I think that it's given him enormous cache and influence in the global South and much [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=735.76s)]
*  of the developing world, which would like to stand up to American dominance or at least [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=742.0s)]
*  is tired of American dominance. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=746.72s)]
*  And if you double click on that article, the second one I sent on Washington trying to [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=748.64s)]
*  negotiate with the Saudis, you know, quote behind the scenes, but obviously this all [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=754.0s)]
*  comes out. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=757.28s)]
*  They're asking assurances that Riyadh will use dollars, not yuan to price oil sales, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=758.56s)]
*  assurances that Saudi won't allow China to build military bases in the kingdom and [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=763.28s)]
*  limitations on Saudi Arabia using technology developed by China. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=768.0s)]
*  And in exchange, the U.S. will protect Saudi will provide military protection and will help [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=772.24s)]
*  them develop a nuclear program, which is an incredible demand. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=778.72s)]
*  So obviously this is an unresolved point, but this becomes a pivot moment for Saudi [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=782.8s)]
*  Arabia. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=786.72s)]
*  They may become a nuclear power, use this as leverage as the U.S. continues to try and [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=787.04s)]
*  keep dollar hegemony alive. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=791.68s)]
*  And my prediction last year was that Trump would get indicted, win the nomination, and [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=792.88s)]
*  then agree not to run in order to get a pardon or something in that vein. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=798.56s)]
*  And it looks like I'm going to get two of those three correct. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=802.72s)]
*  We'll see on the pardon. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=805.6s)]
*  He has been indicted, obviously, and he is looks like a lock to win the nomination, but [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=807.12s)]
*  we'll see. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=813.12s)]
*  I don't it seems like Nikki Ellie's doing okay. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=813.76s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=817.12s)]
*  Biggest political loser of 2024 is what we're going to do next. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=817.92s)]
*  Jamoth, last year you picked DeSantis. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=821.2s)]
*  I picked DeSantis. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=823.36s)]
*  That was a pretty easy one. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=824.24s)]
*  Sachs, you picked California. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=825.52s)]
*  Also a pretty easy one. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=826.96s)]
*  We know that California has gotten demolished. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=828.16s)]
*  Pete Slauson Because specifically California went from having a 76 billion dollar surplus [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=830.88s)]
*  in 2022 to a 68 billion dollar deficit now. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=834.8s)]
*  DeSantis Yeah, it's bonkers. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=838.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=839.44s)]
*  Jared Liesveld I don't think any of those were as obvious as they were in January of [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=840.08s)]
*  last year. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=843.36s)]
*  I think DeSantis was leading. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=843.76s)]
*  He was collecting a lot of big checks and California hadn't imploded. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=845.12s)]
*  Everybody knew that they would be under pressure, but nobody expected to be, I think, this swift. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=849.28s)]
*  So, I don't think those were obvious. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=853.5999999999999s)]
*  I think those were actually pretty decent picks. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=856.0s)]
*  Jared Liesveld Okay. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=857.4399999999999s)]
*  That's a good argument. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=858.0799999999999s)]
*  And then Freberg, you picked debt issues for emerging nations, debt markets start to unravel, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=859.1199999999999s)]
*  IMF steps in. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=863.68s)]
*  I'm not sure I have enough information to check in on that one yet. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=865.76s)]
*  Any thoughts, Freberg? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=869.04s)]
*  Before we go on to our predictions for Biggest Loser in 2024? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=869.8399999999999s)]
*  Freberg I don't think we had any big unwindings like I had expected, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=871.5999999999999s)]
*  but these problems are bubbling and persist. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=875.5999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, Argentina took a big step with the election there. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=878.9599999999999s)]
*  That one was one of the countries that was most at risk of having a big event last year. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=881.68s)]
*  Jared Liesveld Shamath, who's your prediction for Biggest Political Loser in 2024? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=886.16s)]
*  Shamath The Cokes. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=891.04s)]
*  I think on a dollar basis, they are the largest [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=893.04s)]
*  spender in Republican politics they have been, and they have been the [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=896.56s)]
*  most consistent negative indicator of value. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=900.4799999999999s)]
*  And so if you just want to fade a trade, I think you can pretty easily just find where the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=902.96s)]
*  those old school Republicans are putting their money and just kind of short it. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=910.24s)]
*  And right now, as much as I was sort of long the Haley spread trade in 2023, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=914.88s)]
*  I would probably now short that trade in 2024. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=921.52s)]
*  Jared Liesveld Okay, switching it up. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=923.9200000000001s)]
*  Shamath Mostly because of the Cokes. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=926.1600000000001s)]
*  Jared Liesveld Freberg, who do you have? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=927.36s)]
*  Freberg Well, Saxl liked this one, but I think Ukraine might be [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=928.64s)]
*  the biggest loser this year as attention shifts to the brewing conflict in the Middle East. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=933.76s)]
*  During an election year, like the US is facing, continuing this funding of this [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=940.32s)]
*  Ukraine-Russia conflict with US dollars is becoming a more unpopular issue for people to support. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=944.48s)]
*  And so I think because of all these competing interests and the political pressure, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=952.08s)]
*  the US will probably not have the resources to commit to Ukraine. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=957.12s)]
*  I think Ukraine's shot at being a NATO is going to fade away. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=961.76s)]
*  And unfortunately, it seems like the country may be left behind by the end of this year. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=965.68s)]
*  Jared Liesveld Sax, what do you got? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=969.76s)]
*  Saxl Well, I totally agree with that. And I would just add demographic [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=970.96s)]
*  decline or even collapse. They've lost something like half a million soldiers in terms of [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=973.92s)]
*  casualties. They also something like 10 million people have fled the country. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=980.08s)]
*  I read recently that there's only about 20 million people left in the country and half of them are [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=985.12s)]
*  pensioners. So, it's not even clear that the working population of the country is going to [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=988.96s)]
*  be able to support the pensioners. And of course, the war isn't close to being over yet. So, there's [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=993.36s)]
*  going to be even more destruction that happens. So, I agree with that pick. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=997.6800000000001s)]
*  I upleveled my answer a little bit here to have the collective West as the biggest [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1003.2s)]
*  political loser. And Ukraine is a big part of that. Obviously, this huge bet [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1010.4000000000001s)]
*  that the collective West made in terms of pressuring and challenging Putin [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1014.72s)]
*  in Ukraine has completely crapped out. But I would also go much further than that. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1019.2s)]
*  You look at what's happening in Israel and Gaza right now and I don't think that Israel's [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1024.24s)]
*  invasion of Gaza is going well at all. And again, just stepping back, these answers don't reflect [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1028.96s)]
*  my desire for what I want to have happen. It just reflects my honest assessment of who the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1036.56s)]
*  losers are going to be. And I just think that Israel's invasion is not going well. It does not [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1042.56s)]
*  look like they're going to be able to militarily achieve their objective of destroying Hamas. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1050.8s)]
*  Admiral Kirby, who's the Pentagon spokesperson, even said that the other day, which was a pretty [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1056.8799999999999s)]
*  amazing admission. At the same time, Israel is creating a huge humanitarian crisis in Gaza, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1061.2s)]
*  something like over 20,000 Palestinians have already been killed, over 50,000 wounded, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1067.36s)]
*  something like 1.8 million of them have been displaced. And it doesn't look like it's going [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1074.08s)]
*  to let up anytime soon. As a result of this, Israel is facing, I think, a huge amount of condemnation [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1078.32s)]
*  internationally. It is becoming a bit of a global pariah. So that is not going well for America and [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1086.6399999999999s)]
*  the West. And then you're going to have a whole bunch of elections this year, both in the US and [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1093.6s)]
*  in Europe. I think that there's going to be tremendous disruption. Things are really not [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1100.56s)]
*  going well in Europe right now. Large parts of Europe are in recession as a result of losing [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1107.84s)]
*  cheap Russian gas. This is particularly true of Germany. And I think there's going to be some big [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1114.8s)]
*  shakeups in the European Parliament. And I wouldn't be surprised if there was [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1120.08s)]
*  some more shakeups in the US election as well. All right. And I picked for my biggest political [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1125.28s)]
*  loser. I was going to go with the American voter, but I'm hoping that the American voters make [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1129.6799999999998s)]
*  better choices. And maybe we see some alternative candidates, as we said in the last one. And I went [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1133.1999999999998s)]
*  with Netanyahu here. I think, and again, this is just my assessment. This isn't what I want to occur [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1137.76s)]
*  in the world, obviously. But every major Israeli poll is just suggesting that they want him out. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1143.1999999999998s)]
*  And they put the odds of Vox puts the odds of his ouster at 75%. And obviously, yeah, Gaza is not [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1148.64s)]
*  going well. And it feels like there is a massive shift in terms of what was early support. And [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1155.5200000000002s)]
*  obvious support for the terror attacks that occurred on 10.7. And any reasonable person [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1162.4s)]
*  would be supportive of that too. Hey, maybe what's happening in Gaza is not helping the situation and [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1166.5600000000002s)]
*  needs to be resolved and maybe a different approach has to occur. And so I think Netanyahu's [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1173.92s)]
*  going to be the biggest loser in 2024. All right, let's go on to the biggest business winner of [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1178.56s)]
*  2024. Back to business. Last year, last year, in 2023, I predicted laid off tech workers starting [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1184.72s)]
*  startup companies would be the big winner. Chumup, you predicted relativity space 3D printing [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1193.2s)]
*  rocket company. And Sachs, you picked America's natural gas industry, Freiburg, OpenAI. Wow, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1198.48s)]
*  a lot of good choices there. I think OpenAI was a huge winner in 2023. Yeah, Freiburg. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1203.6s)]
*  Even with the cash. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1209.52s)]
*  I would say so. I would say so. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1210.32s)]
*  That was a good pick. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1211.52s)]
*  Massive revenue. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1212.1599999999999s)]
*  The highest market cap gain of the year, probably. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1212.9599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, 30 to 90 billion. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1215.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1217.76s)]
*  American natural gas industry that really actually cooked in 2023. Yeah, Sachs. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1218.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it has new records. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1223.76s)]
*  Good prediction. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1225.6s)]
*  That was a good pick. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1226.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, good pick. All right, so let's go right to 2024 predictions. Freiburg, you haven't let us [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1227.1999999999998s)]
*  off yet, so you're going to be the leadoff batter here. What do you got? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1232.96s)]
*  I'm going with commodities businesses, which I know isn't speaking a specific business, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1236.72s)]
*  but there's a lot of ways to play it. And I think there's a big commodities boom that's coming back [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1240.96s)]
*  in 2024. There's been a lot of underinvestment relative to demand over the past, call it 18 to [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1244.88s)]
*  24 months, coming out of COVID and with rising interest rates. A lot of folks have been selling [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1252.16s)]
*  down inventory and there now needs to be a build back up on inventory and supply. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1259.04s)]
*  There's also a bunch of cash coming into the commodities markets that was sitting [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1264.56s)]
*  in treasuries as yields go down and that cash is coming back. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1269.04s)]
*  So building the base back up, rebuilding stockpiles and supplies coming out of the [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1272.8s)]
*  past 18 months. Obviously, economic activity is strong and robust. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1276.6399999999999s)]
*  So commodities businesses are going to see a killer 2024. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1280.8799999999999s)]
*  Chamath, what do you got? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1284.48s)]
*  I think the biggest business winner in 2024 is going to be the bootstrapped startup and [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1285.44s)]
*  or the profitable startup, but the best will probably be the bootstrapped profitable startup. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1294.0s)]
*  And I think the reason is that we are underestimating how cheap it's going to be [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1300.8s)]
*  to copy an existing business in 2024. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1310.8s)]
*  And so if you assume that these models are going to get 10 and 100 times better [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1315.04s)]
*  and you assume the cost of compute is going to get 10 and 100 times cheaper, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1319.84s)]
*  and you assume the cost of energy is going to get 10 times cheaper, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1324.64s)]
*  you're no longer measuring in decades when a company will be subject to disruption. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1330.24s)]
*  I think you're measuring it in frankly months. And so I think you're going to be able to create [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1334.48s)]
*  these companies for very cheap and essentially have them attack an existing business which has [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1339.2s)]
*  upside on economics because they have just a lot of people and a lot of processes that these [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1346.48s)]
*  GPTs can replicate for essentially free. So if you're profitable, you have the chance to survive. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1352.64s)]
*  And I think if you are unprofitable, I think that you're going to be under a lot of pressure. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1357.68s)]
*  I think it's a great pick. That's exactly what I'm seeing on the field in the early stage. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1363.44s)]
*  Sax, who's your prediction for a biggest business winner of 2024? Who do you predict is going to be [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1368.72s)]
*  the biggest business winner? I'm predicting Andrel for its Roadrunner product, which it announced [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1372.8s)]
*  last year. And this is a drone interceptor. So it basically intercepts drones is built for ground [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1379.36s)]
*  based air defense. And the reason I say this is because if you saw recently what was happening [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1388.48s)]
*  in the Red Sea with the Houthis, the US was having to use $2 million air defense missiles [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1394.4s)]
*  to shoot down $2,000 drones. And that is not sustainable. So right now, we have a huge problem [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1400.5600000000002s)]
*  with asymmetric warfare where our adversaries are using very cheap missiles, very cheap drones, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1407.92s)]
*  swarms of them. And they force us to exhaust our air defenses, which are just way too expensive [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1415.2800000000002s)]
*  on a unit basis. And these cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, do you think? Yeah, I think [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1422.56s)]
*  that's right. I think the Roadrunner system costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, but it's reusable. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1425.6s)]
*  So it's not like you just send one up to take out one drone. Reusable if it doesn't blow up. If it [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1430.32s)]
*  does blow up, I don't think you can reuse it. It basically takes off. It loiterers. This is basically [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1434.48s)]
*  an AI system where it's self-driving, I guess you will. It has operators. And then it returns back [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1441.36s)]
*  to its base station after it's used. It's not like a kamikaze type drone. It's actually a drone [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1447.28s)]
*  killer. Oh, really? I think it is. I think it can do dual purpose. It can either intercept and blow [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1453.36s)]
*  something up or it can return back to base. But we'll have to check in on that. Hey, and shout out [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1457.6s)]
*  to our friend Palmer Lucky. Come back on the program anytime. We miss you. Shout out to our boy. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1461.36s)]
*  Are you an investor, Sax in Andrew? No, I'm not. I'm not an investor, but I think I would be. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1465.84s)]
*  Yeah. You know, so Palmer. They raised a ton of money. Palmer. Great job. Yeah, no, Palmer. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1470.8s)]
*  Actually, I'm building a position right now. I've been buying secondary in Andrel. And for me, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1476.24s)]
*  I was going to go with startups again. Are you really buying secondary shares in Andrel? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1482.72s)]
*  I've been building a large position in Andrel. Yes. I'm trying to get to a 2% ownership position [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1486.72s)]
*  so I can join the board. So I've been using. So shout out to my guy, Palmer Lucky. I am going [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1490.96s)]
*  to go with for my biggest winner in 2024, training data owners like the New York Times, Reddit, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1498.56s)]
*  X, Twitter, YouTube, etc. I think what we learned in 2023 was that the language models are starting [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1504.64s)]
*  to hit parity very quickly. And that the real value is going to be in and it may even become [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1510.96s)]
*  commodities and open source may win the day. So then I think the winner is folks who have the [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1517.5200000000002s)]
*  training data. And I'm actually proposing a new business model for these language models. I think [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1522.24s)]
*  now that we've seen this New York Times, an open AI lawsuit, I think there's a really great outcome [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1528.3200000000002s)]
*  here, which is a market based solution where if you have a chat GPT account, you can log in and [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1533.92s)]
*  federate with your New York Times subscription, or you know, any other subscription, and then it [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1540.64s)]
*  gives you the tier of chat GPT four with the New York Times. And so that could be a win win for [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1546.3200000000002s)]
*  everybody, or they can obviously pay a licensing fee. And so I think this is going to be an amazing [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1551.8400000000001s)]
*  turnaround for the entire content industry. If the language models respect copyright owners, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1556.24s)]
*  and come up with a sustainable system where every year copyright holders can get some money in [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1563.12s)]
*  exchange for using their training data, whether it's on images or content. So I'm very bullish on [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1567.6799999999998s)]
*  accumulate a 2% position in open AI through secondary purchases and get them to do that on [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1573.4399999999998s)]
*  the board. Only two billion. Yeah. No, I think yeah, I mean, we didn't bring this up because [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1578.8799999999999s)]
*  it's broke over the the holiday break. But I think Sam Altman is doing a great job of telling [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1583.04s)]
*  people he wants to do the right thing. And we discussed previously the licensing deal they did [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1588.32s)]
*  with Business Insider and the parent company of it. Axel Springer, what do you think the deal with [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1592.16s)]
*  New York Times will look like? I think it's going to be a nine figure settlement for previous stuff. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1597.0400000000002s)]
*  And then an ongoing licensing fee in order to have the New York Times in their training data. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1602.0s)]
*  And then you'll be able to say, Hey, what does the New York Times think of this, right, you could [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1606.72s)]
*  actually do queries about the New York Times in it. And I think the New York Times will come up with [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1612.0800000000002s)]
*  a license that everybody can use their data if they pay this yearly fee. If you stop paying the [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1616.88s)]
*  yearly fee, then you can't train on it. And we're in uncharted territory. You're saying there's [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1622.0s)]
*  going to be a New York Times model and a non New York Times model? Well, I think you could do two [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1627.04s)]
*  different things. One you could do New York Times can make their own model, right. But they could [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1631.92s)]
*  fork their model or just to the user interface, say if you want to query New York Times information [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1636.48s)]
*  and have that as part of your results, you have to have a New York Times account, right. So if you [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1641.28s)]
*  say I want the best coffee machines or what's the best coffee equipment, it says, oh, if you had wire [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1646.0s)]
*  cutter, and the subscription to New York Times, we would include the wire cutter results. And this [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1651.84s)]
*  idea that technologists can't do citations has been proven absolutely incorrect. There are language [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1657.28s)]
*  models out there that are using citations all the time. Open AI, I think will wind up losing the [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1662.48s)]
*  case if it goes to the mat. I think they're going to pay a big licensing fee to your question, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1666.8s)]
*  Chema. My prediction then is that if this happens, this is not my pick, but I'm just going to tell you, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1670.32s)]
*  I suspect that what happens is you'll get these yearly licensing fees, and then one year, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1676.3999999999999s)]
*  the New York Times just falls off a cliff. And when it comes time to renegotiate, then Open AI [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1681.5200000000002s)]
*  says no, and they won't have a choice. Well, I mean, it's possibility. But if you think about [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1686.72s)]
*  the Disney characters, you know, let's I don't know if you saw Nintendo and Disney characters, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1692.24s)]
*  you know, making stuff on Dali or other things. If you make derivative works on that, and you want [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1697.1200000000001s)]
*  to have that feature as part of your image creator, you just have to have a licensing fee. And so [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1702.3200000000002s)]
*  I think that there's a win win here to be had. And I am really interested to see the market [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1707.2s)]
*  based solution. Because I don't think this is a Napster situation where like Open AI gets shuts [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1711.04s)]
*  down. Because opening eyes too savvy. I bet you the big difference between NAPS from this is there, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1714.56s)]
*  the content universe was limited, and small here, it's infinite and unlimited. And so how do you pay [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1719.6s)]
*  anything to anybody without? I just think it's like without direct attribution of revenue, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1725.76s)]
*  which is basically impossible. You're kind of making a value judgment, which I don't think [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1730.08s)]
*  makes any sense. I think I think doing a revenue licensing deal is impossible when you get into [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1734.48s)]
*  the weeds when these business people sit down and actually start to try to figure out the bid ask. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1740.48s)]
*  I don't know as a rational, coherent business person, what you would model in order to present [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1745.76s)]
*  the number. Yeah, so one suggestion would be what percentage of the models creation was using the [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1752.08s)]
*  New York Times data. And I think people say one to 2% of the original chat GPT was built off a [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1758.96s)]
*  trading data was New York Times. And then if they weighted that heavily, Cheimoth, like let's say [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1764.4s)]
*  they said, New York Times is an authoritatively five times more important than these other sources. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1768.4s)]
*  That could be upwards of five to 10% of the authority of that model. Yeah, but I just, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1773.76s)]
*  yes, it's not easy. But what's the cause? Yeah, but what's the cause for the are you telling me [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1777.8400000000001s)]
*  that like an AI model? The music industry has this. The music industry has this. But what is it? It's [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1782.64s)]
*  going to be like a 30 40% cost of goods. You could say that chat GPT or let's say Apple, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1785.52s)]
*  I predict Apple will do this right, they'll do a language model where they say 50% of the revenue [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1791.2s)]
*  that we generate from queries or subscriptions to this goes to the people we built it off of [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1795.68s)]
*  are the licensees. Sure, why not? Why not? They're already the music industry already does that would [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1801.04s)]
*  guarantee the death of the startup ecosystem. And it would guarantee the lock in a big tech. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1805.3600000000001s)]
*  No, I don't think so. You could build models that don't have the data and you can build models with [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1812.88s)]
*  it. So it'll be a choice by the person who builds the model and synthetic data might make it. So you [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1816.64s)]
*  don't need the New York Times from off its early days for synthetic data. I don't have an opinion. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1820.48s)]
*  I'm just reacting to this idea that 50% of cogs, then all of a sudden, these aren't software [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1824.72s)]
*  companies, you know, these software companies will have a gross margin of like 30%. Yeah. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1829.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, what does Spotify pay for music? You know, so the same argument is made for Spotify, you know, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1833.44s)]
*  or Netflix, when they were licensing Jason, that's the difference. It's limited in scope, meaning [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1838.0s)]
*  there's there's only ever one hit song from Rihanna that matters, or Jay Z or whomever, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1842.08s)]
*  pick Taylor Swift. And so it's a very scoped content universe. And so you can describe value [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1847.84s)]
*  much easier, because then the user goes and actually listens to that song over another, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1852.56s)]
*  this is about something that's happening under the waterline, where you don't know how the iceberg [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1857.1999999999998s)]
*  is built. There are things under the model that do it. And then there's also quoting stuff. And [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1861.76s)]
*  that's really where the New York Times got their cotton with their hand in the cookie jar, is that [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1866.08s)]
*  when it was regurgitating information and giving the results, it was quoting deeply New York Times [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1870.08s)]
*  proprietary content. And so that's, that's where there's like, you're right about the training data, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1875.2s)]
*  but you might be wrong about the [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1880.24s)]
*  Yeah, but that could be fixed. Right? They could train models, and they could, they could exclude [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1881.92s)]
*  storing any proprietary data, you can create a filter that says the model can't store any of [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1887.2s)]
*  this data. But it can still be trained on [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1891.6000000000001s)]
*  or can't use it, right? So if you say what's the best coffee machine, it can't use the New York [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1893.68s)]
*  Times wire cutted data. And I bet you that Sam Waltman has already built a model without it. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1897.8400000000001s)]
*  I guarantee you they've already built a for an emergent press here in case of emergency. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1902.88s)]
*  Here's the 4.5 model in case they got an injunction, which would be highly unlikely. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1907.92s)]
*  But if they did get an injunction, they just say, okay, here's 4.5. It doesn't use the New York [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1911.2s)]
*  Times training data. So this is all uncharted territory, as we all know, I think we got [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1915.2s)]
*  everybody's business predictions, okay, and roll commodities, training data, and bootstrap profitable [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1921.1200000000001s)]
*  startups with a great cohort there. Let's go on to biggest business losers in 2024. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1926.64s)]
*  2023. Chamath said Google search as measured by profitability engagement. SAC said the consumer. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1932.16s)]
*  Freberg said capital intensive series BCs and D growth companies. That's pretty, pretty good [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1940.96s)]
*  winner there. And I said white collar workers without hard skills, also known as surplus elites. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1946.24s)]
*  Any feedback on those boys as your winner? I'll give you my prediction for 24. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1953.68s)]
*  Please. Yes, go ahead. Vertical SaaS companies, I think, are going to get [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1958.0s)]
*  smacked this year. And I mentioned this, I think we talked about this off the show. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1963.1999999999998s)]
*  Or if we talk about on the show, I apologize. But like I think these tools to write code, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1969.6799999999998s)]
*  no code tools, co-piloting tools, and the ability for engineers to get 20, 50, 100x more productive [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1974.56s)]
*  to build custom applications for their enterprise are so incredibly powerful. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1983.2s)]
*  I mentioned this to you guys, I know of a couple vertical SaaS businesses that some of my companies [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1987.8400000000001s)]
*  use the software, and they're getting off the software because they've built homegrown solutions [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1993.76s)]
*  in a very low cost, very low touch way. And I'm seeing that so frequently now. I think this is a [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=1999.2s)]
*  real threat to vertical SaaS businesses that can charge thousands of dollars per seat per year that [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2005.3600000000001s)]
*  are getting disrupted by the ability for companies now to very cheaply and quickly build homegrown [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2010.16s)]
*  solutions using a lot of the generative tools that are out there. Sax, your prediction. My [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2015.3600000000001s)]
*  prediction for biggest business loser in 24 is actually the German economy. There's two big [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2019.68s)]
*  problems there. First is that the loss of cheap Russian gas has really cut the legs out from under [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2025.8400000000001s)]
*  the German industrial model. Their entire economy is based on industrial output. And cheap Russian [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2031.92s)]
*  gas was sort of at the foundation of that. As you guys know, someone blew up the Nord Stream pipeline. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2038.8s)]
*  I think that has really hurt the German economy. And then second, the German car industry has been [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2045.2s)]
*  massively impacted by a sudden glut of cheap cars coming from China. So if you look at the Chinese [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2052.88s)]
*  automotive industry, it's really exploded in the last few years. And auto exports is one of the [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2060.16s)]
*  biggest products that Germany manufactures. And with German costs going up and Chinese costs coming [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2066.88s)]
*  down, that's just not a very good place for them to be. So I think double whammy for Germany. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2073.84s)]
*  Chamath, do you have the biggest business loser in 2024? I am going to say that 24 [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2079.84s)]
*  is the peak in terms of valuations of professional sports. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2087.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, and I will give you four examples in 2023 that I think were in some very concerning [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2093.12s)]
*  or pro sports franchise values. As of today. The first was you had an upstart competitor to a league [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2103.04s)]
*  that came out of nowhere, used money to overcome the ability to attract stars. I'm talking about [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2111.36s)]
*  I'm talking about the live tour versus the PGA and then essentially forced the PGA into merger [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2118.96s)]
*  talks with them. The second was you had a country use their balance sheet to basically try to [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2125.36s)]
*  jumpstart their own professional sports business. In this case, it was soccer. The country was [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2132.32s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and the players were Ronaldo and Messi. They got one, but not the other. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2138.4s)]
*  The third was the explosion of NIL inside the NCAA. You have people in college now making more [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2142.64s)]
*  in some cases than the same player in a professional sports context. So they're making millions of [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2150.72s)]
*  dollars to be in college. And then the fourth, which may not seem like it's related, but there [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2156.16s)]
*  was an article in the Wall Street Journal, I think recently about a meaningful uptick in churn [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2162.56s)]
*  amongst all the streamers, Netflix, Hulu, all of these companies, Amazon, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2168.08s)]
*  Coir, the only folks with in a position to actually have the balance sheet to keep paying a premium [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2174.0s)]
*  for professional sports rights. So I think when you put that all together, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2180.3999999999996s)]
*  you can start to see that there's been a tipping point in enterprise values. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2185.04s)]
*  The acceleration we've seen over the last decade has slowed down. So I would say that 2024 is going [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2191.9199999999996s)]
*  to be the year of peak pro sports values. Okay, starts to come down. And I went with smart phones, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2197.52s)]
*  smartphone manufacturers are facing a major slowdown. Consumers obviously love their phones and [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2204.56s)]
*  use them constantly. But people are skipping a generation of phones. And if you look at [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2209.44s)]
*  Apple's revenue, they're having a very hard time getting people to upgrade. And so I think that's [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2214.16s)]
*  going to flatten out, they will keep trying to squeeze money out of it. I don't know what you [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2218.96s)]
*  guys spent on your iPhone 15 if you got it, but I, I always buy the top of the line. And I think [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2223.04s)]
*  it was 14 or $1,500 this time. And when I got the accountants, they said, Oh, is this a new laptop? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2227.2799999999997s)]
*  I said, No, it's a new phone. But I think this is going to slow down and people will [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2233.84s)]
*  during austerity, they're going to skip two or three versions of it. I know I skipped for the [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2238.72s)]
*  first time I skipped the 14 this time around. So I'm going with smartphone manufacturers and [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2242.08s)]
*  Apple would be obviously the tip of that spear. Let's keep moving our next prediction. Biggest [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2246.96s)]
*  business deal of 2024. Biggest business deal of 2024. I went with last year, my prediction was [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2251.92s)]
*  Amazon getting into healthcare, maybe they buy Peloton or Roman hymns. And they have been getting [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2259.36s)]
*  into healthcare a bunch more. And my my wildcard was a CCP divesting and tik tok that didn't happen. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2264.2400000000002s)]
*  Chamath you went Starlink goes public in a spin out from SpaceX at 75 billion that didn't happen. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2270.7200000000003s)]
*  But Starlink is doing fantastic. Sax you said a deal between Putin and Xi. And then Freiburg, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2275.76s)]
*  you said, Petro for one trade, the Saudi China trade. Any thoughts on the predictions there? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2283.28s)]
*  Doesn't look like anybody nailed it. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2289.36s)]
*  Well, no, actually, Putin and Xi did make a deal their ties have never been stronger. And the trade [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2291.5200000000004s)]
*  between those two countries keeps increasing as a result of the fact that we pushed Russia into [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2296.0s)]
*  China's arms. So that absolutely happened. And what's your prediction this year, Sax? Biggest [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2300.7200000000003s)]
*  business deal. Sax, what do you got? My biggest business deal is whatever the Fed decides to do [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2304.8s)]
*  to replace or extend BTFP, the bank term funding program. Remember that the BTFP, which is what the [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2310.7200000000003s)]
*  Fed used to bail out the regional banking system last year, and was like March or April, it was [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2318.6400000000003s)]
*  only supposed to last for one year, it's supposed to be a temporary program. But I do not think that [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2324.6400000000003s)]
*  the balance sheets of regional banks are healthy enough to survive without this continued liquidity [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2329.2s)]
*  from this program. So I think the Fed's gonna have to do something to either replace the program, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2336.0s)]
*  extend the program. They're gonna have to do something. And I think that regional banks are [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2340.96s)]
*  still in pretty bad shape with, you know, impaired commercial debt portfolios. And they need this [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2346.72s)]
*  liquidity as long as the yield curve remains inverted. So I think the Fed is going to try [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2354.48s)]
*  and somehow figure out a program to keep these guys liquid until they can de-invert the yield curve. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2360.64s)]
*  And I think the Fed's trying to massage all of this into place without there being a recession. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2371.92s)]
*  Seems like they'll be able to do it. Jamath, what do you got? I'm going to go with the same thing. I [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2376.48s)]
*  think I was just off by your Starlink will go public. Fascinating. I like it. And I had a similar [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2380.56s)]
*  theme. My wildcard last year that the CCP would divest of TikTok, I'm going to say this year [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2389.7599999999998s)]
*  that I think TikTok goes public and they'll be under pressure from different political [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2396.4s)]
*  factions to get the CCP off the board. So I'm going to go with By Dance taking, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2402.32s)]
*  going public or TikTok spinning out and going public. Some version of that. Freeberg, what do [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2407.04s)]
*  you got for this year? We've got some continuation bets here from Jake Allen. Yeah, I would keep [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2411.28s)]
*  going with my Petro-Yuans trade bet. I don't think that the US is going to let Saudi become [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2415.28s)]
*  a nuclear power, but so maybe leave that one outstanding. But I think rights holders getting [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2420.32s)]
*  licensing deals for generative AI, or there's going to be a couple of blockbuster deals this year. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2426.16s)]
*  Great. Where you'll see like Disney license out a chunk of their library [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2430.72s)]
*  so people can generate on demand video games or content or I don't know. You guys remember this [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2435.52s)]
*  company in the early 2000s called Zazzle? Do you remember that company? Yeah. What was that? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2440.88s)]
*  Printed stuff on mugs. Yeah. And they had a big deal with Disney where the idea was you could [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2445.36s)]
*  put any character in any way you want on any piece of like t-shirt or mug or whatever. Merch. Yeah. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2451.52s)]
*  And it was like Merch. And it was a big deal. I think we see that again with generative AI this [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2458.16s)]
*  year where you can take for example, a character from a movie and generate them in an image. So [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2462.16s)]
*  anyone that has an interesting content rights will start to license it out and get a lot of [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2467.12s)]
*  value from it. Absolutely. Because a couple of big deals like that this year. Okay, most [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2472.16s)]
*  contrarian belief of 2024. I went American exceptionalism source. I think I like that [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2476.3999999999996s)]
*  prediction from last year ahead. Chamath, you said inflation doesn't fall off a cliff as fast as [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2482.48s)]
*  people want. Saks says the bromance between Biden and Zelensky comes to an end. Freeberg, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2487.2s)]
*  you said 2023 marks the beginning of the end of the US dollar as the global reserve currency. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2492.3999999999996s)]
*  I nailed that one. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2497.68s)]
*  It didn't fall off a cliff? It didn't. What was inflation in the first quarter of 2023? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2501.8399999999997s)]
*  Just kidding. It fell off a cliff. Oh, I'm like, yeah, I'm like, wait a second. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2507.6s)]
*  It's like, what the f*** are you talking about? Yeah, sorry, you're confusing me. I'm like, really? [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2512.64s)]
*  Wait a second. I think you get the Jim Kramer or the Professor Galloway moment for that prediction. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2516.64s)]
*  Yeah, I think you might have missed that one by a bit. All right. What do you got? Chamath for [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2522.24s)]
*  this year? What do you got? Most contrarian belief of 2024? I think the enterprise value of open AI [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2527.52s)]
*  goes down. Okay, I don't think it has anything to do with open AI. I think it has everything to do [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2532.0s)]
*  with the rest of the industry. I think I think there's a couple of factors at play similar to [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2539.2799999999997s)]
*  what I just said earlier. But if you actually try to use these tools, which now I have been [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2544.24s)]
*  in my sort of day job as CEO, I've been trying to build models, Sunny's been helping me. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2551.44s)]
*  My takeaway are two things. Number one is the latency right now amongst all these AI tools [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2556.7999999999997s)]
*  makes building production quality code absolutely impossible. So you can't have [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2563.6s)]
*  APIs where you take 30, 40, 50 seconds in between a request to get data back. That's [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2568.32s)]
*  ridiculous. These need to be non-starter. Yeah. 50, 30, 40, 70 milliseconds. Second is the actual [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2574.7200000000003s)]
*  cost of a million tokens on any of these platforms is economically untenable if you're trying to [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2582.56s)]
*  build something. So whether it's Amazon, whether it's together AI, whether it's open AI, it's [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2591.7599999999998s)]
*  extremely, extremely expensive. So I think that capitalism would tell you that if these two things [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2598.8799999999997s)]
*  are true, you should expect people to arbitrage that opening. And so if you see cloud services [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2605.2s)]
*  come out that allow you to basically get millisecond latency batch size one on the one hand, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2614.08s)]
*  and second, where you have pricing for a million tokens that sort of 10, 20 cents, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2620.0s)]
*  those folks, and they'll need to build their own custom hardware to do it. But those folks [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2626.16s)]
*  will multiply the capability of this market by a thousand X. And I think when that happens, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2631.12s)]
*  the open source models really proliferate, proprietary models and closed models go under [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2638.16s)]
*  pressure. And the existing economics of how you make money today will get reallocated to those [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2643.2s)]
*  different players. And I think in that it's going to be very hard for existing folks. I would say [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2648.8s)]
*  the same is probably true for Nvidia. The folks that have won up until today to maintain a multiple [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2653.84s)]
*  of market cap in this next year that happens. And so my prediction is that will happen. And as a [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2660.8s)]
*  result, the enterprise values of those companies and I think opening up will be the most obvious [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2666.2400000000002s)]
*  will go down. People buying secondary at 90 billion right now will be underwater next year. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2670.6400000000003s)]
*  Again, they have to believe that the revenue composition today is sustainable. And if you look [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2675.76s)]
*  under the hood, half the revenue is consumers paying subscriptions. The other half the revenue [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2682.2400000000002s)]
*  are enterprises paying for essentially some version of AWS. Yes. But the problem is that version of [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2687.44s)]
*  AWS is economically non functional. It's unsustainable. It's way too expensive and it's way too slow. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2693.6800000000003s)]
*  And by the way, that's just not an open AI problem. It's an entire industry problem. And so if this [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2702.8799999999997s)]
*  industry is really going to be real, it needs to be literally dirt cheap and as close to zero as [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2707.7599999999998s)]
*  possible. The minute that that happens, that revenue goes away. So then they just left with [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2712.96s)]
*  the subscription. And by the way, the people that provide that will be the ones that have the [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2717.2s)]
*  hardware to enable that thousand Xing of the cost, which is Azure, AWS. No, no, no, no. I think these [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2720.72s)]
*  are startups that are building proprietary hardware. Oh, okay. Wow. So there's another [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2728.64s)]
*  prediction. Freebird, what do you got 2024 prediction? Most contrarian belief. Okay. So [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2732.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't think we're past the conflict escalation stage. I think things are only going to [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2737.68s)]
*  continue to mount. So a lot of the theater that we see on a global stage is more fundamentally driven [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2742.96s)]
*  by these big cycles that we're in. So I think a big one and a kind of tactical one, I think the [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2751.6s)]
*  big one that's contrarian is that there's an increased probability of a nuclear weapon being [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2758.96s)]
*  used for the first time in conflict. And I think that that's conditioned on the fact that there are [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2763.92s)]
*  declining military supplies. There's declining appetite and capacity to support traditional [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2770.64s)]
*  conflict meat grinder type conflicts that we're seeing spread up everywhere right now. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2778.08s)]
*  And it worked not everywhere, but in a lot of places. And you could see a moment where, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2783.52s)]
*  as I mentioned in the past, someone gets backed into a corner and a tactical low yield nuclear [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2788.08s)]
*  weapon gets used. And I think that when you do that, it opens up the gates to hell. So it's a [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2792.24s)]
*  little scary. That's why, you know, we all joking aside. That's why you bought the radiation suits. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2796.24s)]
*  And by the way, I don't think this is a high probability. And I'm not joking. I don't think [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2801.92s)]
*  it's a high probability. I think it's like, you know, call it one to 2% chance something like [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2805.28s)]
*  this happens. But it's 10 X where it was five years ago. And so that's my outcome of this is [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2808.7200000000003s)]
*  terrifying. Yeah, it's such a significant event that it's definitely one to kind of be thoughtful [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2815.28s)]
*  about. And then the other one that I kind of said was tactical is I think there's a risk that [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2819.92s)]
*  Turkey gets challenged to leave NATO that a lot of what's going on right now where Turkey is siding [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2824.32s)]
*  with Hamas. This has obviously been talked about and rumored about for a long time. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2831.6s)]
*  There's no real mechanism, by the way, for kicking a member out of NATO. But I'll share with you guys, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2835.7599999999998s)]
*  there's a lot of political commentary that Turkey cannot be a trusted ally. And obviously that now, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2840.64s)]
*  you know, Turkey is siding with folks who are actual threats to the West. The US incentive is [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2845.44s)]
*  you don't want to see Turkey with the biggest one of the biggest armies in Europe, run into Russia's [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2850.88s)]
*  arms. You're going to try to keep them in NATO, but there is a real risk that you start to see the [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2855.12s)]
*  first fracturing of NATO happen with Turkey being asked to leave or some negotiation on something [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2860.24s)]
*  that happens this year. So that's one that I keep an eye on that is certainly not top of anyone's [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2865.52s)]
*  mind, but it certainly begins to beg the question of the importance of NATO. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2870.64s)]
*  Aaron Norris What do you got, Sax? Your most [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2876.16s)]
*  contrarian belief? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2878.3999999999996s)]
*  Sacks Well, can I first just make a comment on last year's pick? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2879.2s)]
*  Aaron Norris Yes. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2882.08s)]
*  Sacks If it's okay. So I, you know, last year, I felt like I was going out on a limb predicting [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2883.04s)]
*  a rift in the bromance between Biden and Zelensky because that relationship seems so tight. And with [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2887.44s)]
*  about four days left in the year, there was this article that came out in Politico that says the [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2893.76s)]
*  Biden administration is quietly shifting its strategy in Ukraine. The article basically says [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2899.12s)]
*  that the administration wants to go on the defensive. And I think pretty clearly it wants [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2903.12s)]
*  to cease fire and a frozen conflict. It wants to get this conflict sort of out of the way, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2907.36s)]
*  swept under the rug before the election season really cranks into high gear. And the problem they [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2913.68s)]
*  have is that Zelensky does not want to negotiate a ceasefire with Russia that would involve Ukraine [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2919.04s)]
*  losing territory. So there is now a rift between maybe not Biden himself, but let's say Biden [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2926.64s)]
*  operatives, the Biden administration, and what Zelensky wants. And I think this will be a theme [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2933.12s)]
*  in 2024 is how do you rein in Zelensky after you've been telling the public for the last two years [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2939.2s)]
*  that our job is to support whatever Zelensky wants. And your prediction for this year? So my [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2946.56s)]
*  prediction for this year is that the soft landing gets very bumpy. I think that over the last two [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2951.2s)]
*  months of the year, I think markets got super optimistic. They started pricing in big Fed rate [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2957.2s)]
*  cuts, you know, let's call it one and a half percent. So we had this huge stock market rally [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2962.48s)]
*  in November, December, and I think there's generally a very strong belief that the Fed [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2967.2799999999997s)]
*  will be able to pull off the soft landing. I'm not necessarily saying that there's going to be a [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2971.7599999999998s)]
*  recession. I just, you know, I feel like I predicted 10 of the last two recessions. So [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2976.56s)]
*  I keep basically predicting recession when there's not one. But I do think that there's just been too [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2982.3999999999996s)]
*  much too soon of this euphoria. And I just think that this year is going to be a lot bumpier than [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2987.8399999999997s)]
*  that, both politically and economically. So I think there's just a little bit too much [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=2994.48s)]
*  euphoria and over optimism right now. I've attempted to go again with American exceptionalism. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3000.48s)]
*  I think I nailed that last year. America just had an amazing year in 2023 while Xi Jinping made [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3005.28s)]
*  unforced errors and getting rid of capitalism in his country and nobody starting companies there [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3011.6s)]
*  on stock market falling apart, real estate falling apart. And now he's coming back to America, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3016.4s)]
*  as we saw when he had a summit with Biden, asking people, please come back and invest again. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3020.0s)]
*  Huge unforced error. And I think Russia with the huge unforced error of losing hundreds of [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3024.72s)]
*  thousands of their citizens, their young people to a senseless war for no reason, and losing [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3029.44s)]
*  customers in the West like Germany, as you pointed out, sacks, I think American exceptionalism will [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3035.44s)]
*  continue to soar. But I don't want to predict take the same prediction. So I also consider two other [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3040.8s)]
*  options, Apple making huge gains in generative AI and then streaming services, right sizing and [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3047.36s)]
*  becoming highly profitable and having a rebound between those two. I think I'm going to go with [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3052.88s)]
*  Apple as my contrarian belief, I think Apple is going to become a player in AI. The end of the [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3057.28s)]
*  year, maybe they reboot Siri, but they're going to figure something out. And I think they're not [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3063.12s)]
*  going to remain on the sidelines when it comes to AI. So I'm going to go with Apple making huge gains [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3067.6800000000003s)]
*  in generative AI or AI in general, maybe a new Siri coming soon. Best performing asset of 2024. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3074.48s)]
*  In 2023, I went with seed stage investing, I think I'll be proven right in five years. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3081.2s)]
*  But that's kind of hard to prove in the short term. Chamath, you said cash and the front [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3086.0s)]
*  end of the yield curve, Saks you went with short term T-bills as well. And Freberg, you went with [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3089.68s)]
*  semiconductor capital equipment, oil gas services, pharma infrastructure. Anybody have thoughts on [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3095.2799999999997s)]
*  their predictions from last year? Saks was pretty good at 5%. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3100.64s)]
*  No kidding, right? As good as it gets. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3103.92s)]
*  This is not a lot of innovation to enter the markets when you're [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3106.24s)]
*  burning five, five and a half percent risk free. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3109.36s)]
*  Okay, so let's do our 2020 cap equipment up 60%. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3111.52s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3115.2000000000003s)]
*  It's a good year. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3116.0s)]
*  Good year. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3116.56s)]
*  Freberg, what do you got? What's your prediction for best performing asset of this coming year? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3117.44s)]
*  Oh, I took the uranium ETF, URA, easy money. Whether it plays out in the next 12 months or over time, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3121.52s)]
*  I'm not sure it's just an inevitability. A lot of folks have this bet on this trade on it. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3129.1200000000003s)]
*  Explain the trade? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3134.88s)]
*  Explain why. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3136.0s)]
*  It's an index on businesses that benefit from mining and producing nuclear power, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3138.88s)]
*  mining uranium producing nuclear power. China is building up 450 nuclear power stations, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3144.4s)]
*  as we talked about. There's a lot of ESG driven demand and a lot of conflict driven demand, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3148.8s)]
*  a big shift underway. A lot of deregulatory effort underway globally to try and get nuclear [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3152.8s)]
*  back on track, nuclear power back on track. So these companies are going to benefit from [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3159.52s)]
*  this big macro cycle. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3164.0s)]
*  So it's a... [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3165.04s)]
*  And this is an existing ETF where you're saying you roll one. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3165.76s)]
*  No, it's called uranium. It's uranium tracking ETF. URA is the ticker. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3169.12s)]
*  I like that a lot and sentiment has changed. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3174.88s)]
*  I do a lot of esoteric general statements. This one I thought I'd go a little specific. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3177.36s)]
*  I like it. I mean, it's a great prediction and sentiment has certainly changed here in the US. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3181.76s)]
*  By the way, that trade has been on, right? So since I'll just tell you guys, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3187.2s)]
*  it bottomed out in March of this year at 19 bucks. It's up 50% since then. And in the last five years, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3190.56s)]
*  it's up 2X, but plenty of room to run if you look at the underlying assets that ETF tracks. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3198.64s)]
*  Chamath, what do you got? Best performing asset of 2024. What's your prediction? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3205.28s)]
*  I have to do it with the worst performing asset of 2024 because it's a bit of a spread trade. So [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3208.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm going to take the public software index, tech stock index, and my short is going to be the [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3213.44s)]
*  private tech software companies, the late stage, mostly SaaS companies. And I think we've all [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3220.7200000000003s)]
*  talked about the reasons why, but I think that the terminal valuations are getting [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3227.52s)]
*  reset in the public markets. I don't think the growth rates are there in the private companies. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3231.28s)]
*  The problem is you will have taken another 30% dilution between now and then because of all the [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3236.48s)]
*  stock-based comp that these private companies give out. So long the public tech cycle, short [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3242.56s)]
*  the private late stage tech cycle, expecting a very high value. And then the problem is you [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3248.72s)]
*  will have to take a very long time to get to the point where you're going to have to take a very [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3254.56s)]
*  long time. Long the public tech cycle, short the private late stage tech cycle, expecting a [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3260.16s)]
*  valuation contraction in the latter. What do you got, Sacks? What do you think's going to be the [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3265.92s)]
*  best performing asset of 2024? Well, I'm really not sure about this, so I would urge nobody to [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3269.28s)]
*  actually trade on this. But this is not investment. It would be clear. None of this is investment. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3276.16s)]
*  But yeah, I'm not. I'm not trading on this on these predictions, so you shouldn't either. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3282.24s)]
*  there. My guess here, just a guess is energy, is energy stocks, energy prices could be among [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3285.68s)]
*  the top performers of 2024, just because there's so much risk of conflict breaking out now [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3293.8399999999997s)]
*  and escalating. So I agree with Freeberg that there are huge risks of escalation in the [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3300.56s)]
*  Middle East, the Ukraine war is still going on. I think not enough attention is being [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3305.68s)]
*  paid to what's happening between Venezuela and Guyana. Venezuela is basically attempting [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3309.68s)]
*  to annex Guyana's offshore oil reserves, which are huge. This is basically just pure theft. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3316.7999999999997s)]
*  Ethiopia also has tense relationships with a few of its neighbors and I could easily see there [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3323.9199999999996s)]
*  being a war that breaks out between Ethiopia and Egypt or Ethiopia and Eritrea. And then that [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3331.04s)]
*  could spill over and create further disruption in the Red Sea. We also still have this unresolved [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3339.44s)]
*  issue of the Houthis. And of course, you have neocons braying for war with Iran as they always [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3343.76s)]
*  do. John Bolton just published another piece saying that we had to go to war with Iran. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3348.8s)]
*  So there's just so many ways that the conflict could escalate and create, I think, a spike in [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3352.7200000000003s)]
*  the price of oil. All right. I'd love to, in my heart of hearts, I believe the best performing [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3360.08s)]
*  asset will still be seed stage startups. But I'm going to go with consumer comfort services. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3366.0s)]
*  I think as austerity measures and this, whether we have a soft landing or a recession, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3373.52s)]
*  it's clear the consumers have spent all their money. So they're going to go for small [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3379.36s)]
*  luxuries like DoorDash, Airbnb, Uber, small things to have great experiences. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3383.12s)]
*  And I'm talking my book in two out of those three, which I own shares in. But I think [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3390.0s)]
*  consumers are going to keep treating themselves to getting some DoorDash or getting an Airbnb [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3394.32s)]
*  and going to Japan or whatever it happens to be. So consumer comfort services is my pick for the [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3400.2400000000002s)]
*  best performing asset of 2024. Worst performing asset. Let's go right on to worst performing asset. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3404.4s)]
*  We're cooking with oil. Worst performing asset, I went with energy, Chamapo and tech, energy, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3410.4s)]
*  junk debt. Saxo went with office hours in San Francisco. And Freberg went with consumer credit. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3415.6000000000004s)]
*  Wow, I think we nailed it in almost all those cases here. What do we got for 2024? Saxo, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3420.72s)]
*  you got a 2024 prediction of worst performing asset. Again, this is not investing advice. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3427.52s)]
*  Yeah, so I'm not going to trade on this. So just take it with a grain of salt. But I would bet [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3432.3199999999997s)]
*  against the magnificent seven, just because I believe that what goes up must come down. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3437.68s)]
*  And the hotter they are, the harder they fall. I'm not saying that the magnificent seven are [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3443.04s)]
*  actually going to go down. I'm just saying that the S&P 493 are going to catch up a little bit. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3447.84s)]
*  So I would book this as a spread trade, where I would bet on the S&P 493 over the magnificent [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3453.6000000000004s)]
*  seven, because again, I just think that there's got to be some catching up here. And the huge gains [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3461.1200000000003s)]
*  made by the magnificent seven were really based on story, you know, based on AI. And I don't see [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3468.0s)]
*  why those gains should be limited to the magnificent seven if AI is going to play [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3476.24s)]
*  such a big role in the economy. Chema, I too, what you predicted earlier about OpenAI losing [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3482.16s)]
*  some value, my worst performing asset in 2024 is LLM startups, I believe they've been massively [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3489.12s)]
*  overvalued. And I believe open source is making an incredible run at them. And I think they're [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3494.24s)]
*  going to hit parity. And there's too many players. This is like having 15 search engines or 20 Amazons. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3499.12s)]
*  There's just too many players and there's too much parity. The prices make no sense. And I [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3504.72s)]
*  think they're all going to come down by, you know, 50, 60, 70, 80% in terms of their valuations. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3509.12s)]
*  That won't get marked in their books. But that will be the reality of where their stocks will [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3515.68s)]
*  trade on the private markets. Freeberg, what's your worst performing asset? [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3519.4399999999996s)]
*  Worst performing asset? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3523.8399999999997s)]
*  Just based on what I shared earlier, I would go short vertical SaaS, vertical software companies [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3524.64s)]
*  and long cloud providers that have AI tools and platforms that will allow enterprises to build [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3531.2s)]
*  custom applications in a low cost, low code way. And so you can obviously pick the companies that [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3538.64s)]
*  would go in that bucket, go along those cloud bucket and go short the vertical bucket. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3545.2799999999997s)]
*  Is there like a per seat price threshold that you think would kind of demarcate the companies [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3549.4399999999996s)]
*  that you think are at risk? In other words, like I invest in plenty of SaaS companies [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3556.32s)]
*  that sell seats at five, 10 bucks per seat per month. I'm just like very skeptical. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3561.1200000000003s)]
*  They're not going anywhere. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3566.8s)]
*  They're not going anywhere. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3567.52s)]
*  Yeah, that is worth an enterprise's while to recreate that software. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3568.0800000000004s)]
*  No. And so I'll give you an example that there's a vertical software provider. We're paying [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3571.04s)]
*  five grand per seat per year right now. And we look at that and we're like, okay, it's basically [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3577.3599999999997s)]
*  a data management tool for our particular vertical. Let's just go recreate that and did it very [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3586.08s)]
*  quickly, very low cost and we're going to replace it. Cut that out. I don't want to say that, but [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3591.12s)]
*  yeah. So it's like, you know, very specific, very expensive, but I mean, sacks, you can probably see [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3595.52s)]
*  the same thing happen in sales CRM type tools that are obviously also very expensive. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3604.16s)]
*  And how much is it data? How much do you pay? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3608.96s)]
*  Five grand per person. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3612.3999999999996s)]
*  Five grand per year. So that's basically over $400 a seat per month. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3614.3199999999997s)]
*  We have like a hundred employees. So we're paying like 500 grand. And so one of our software [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3619.6s)]
*  engineers is like, this spins up a replacement for it. We're going to roll it out in Q1. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3624.24s)]
*  Okay. So is there, is there like a per seat per month price that you think [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3629.68s)]
*  starts to where it doesn't work? Is it 50 bucks? What is the number? [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3634.0s)]
*  I mean, I do the math, but yeah, it shouldn't be in the range that it's at for sure. But a lot [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3637.7599999999998s)]
*  of these guys, where they had a monopoly and it wasn't worth the company's time to try and invest [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3641.44s)]
*  in software at the price point that they were charging, they found a market. Now the market [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3645.6s)]
*  has to compress. So I'm not saying that the companies go away, but I do think pricing [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3650.0s)]
*  compression is going to hurt these businesses a lot. If you pay, could pay 50,000 for the same [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3653.3599999999997s)]
*  software instead of 500, you would not have spun it up yourself. So there is a reasonable number [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3657.52s)]
*  between those two and that reasonable number might be 250 or something. Yeah. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3662.16s)]
*  But here's the thing that we need to also factor in, which is that Freeberg's companies, that [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3666.0s)]
*  engineer could also then just release that product for everybody else to use at 10 search and [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3670.32s)]
*  everybody else will then use it because it'll be good enough. And that, and that 80% solution [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3677.68s)]
*  will take over the, we'll take over the market. Yeah. That's my point. There's going to be pricing [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3682.96s)]
*  compression. This is the thing like, I think that people underestimate how deflationary this [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3686.48s)]
*  whole thing is. If it's like, it's like two out of three orders of magnitude, more deflationary [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3689.76s)]
*  than people have any inkling of. Yep. Interestingly, I had a Dave and Hanmer Hansen [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3694.4s)]
*  on this week in startups and they're releasing something called once.com where they're going to [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3699.84s)]
*  charge for software one time like we used to do. And their first product is a Slack killer. And [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3703.84s)]
*  so the idea of paying per seat for Slack, what they're planning to do is just charge you, you [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3709.12s)]
*  know, 895. No, you find a hosting company. So you host it. Okay. So it's like old school. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3714.32s)]
*  It's old school. It's old school on-prem software. On-prem. And then you pay an upgrade fee when you [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3720.7200000000003s)]
*  upgrade the software, basically. I think they're going to probably do. You're going to pay them [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3725.6800000000003s)]
*  like a maintenance percentage. That's the way it always works. Old school enterprise software, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3729.04s)]
*  right? The pricing model was, the revenue model was always built that when you did a sale, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3733.2000000000003s)]
*  you would make on average 20% of the revenue per year in update fees. And so that, and then [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3737.84s)]
*  everything switched to SAS, which would just continue to support maintenance, all that kind [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3744.16s)]
*  of stuff. So it's never, they say it's one time. It's one time for the software, but if you want [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3748.24s)]
*  to stay up to date and get support and patches and all that kind of stuff. Yeah. And the old school [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3752.72s)]
*  enterprise software model was always like figure 20% of the install cost. Right. And by the way, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3758.16s)]
*  this is one of the reasons why Oracle made so much money is they did a roll up of all these old school [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3764.0s)]
*  on-prem software companies that weren't growing, but the maintenance fees were just rolling in [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3769.44s)]
*  forever. Yep. And they rolled all that stuff up. And then probably raised the fees. I mean, for me, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3774.4s)]
*  you know, when you have a 20 person company, 50 person company, the Slack fees don't seem [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3779.76s)]
*  like a big deal, but when you get to, you know, when you're spending 500,000 or a million dollars [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3783.6800000000003s)]
*  a year on something like Slack, you know, then maybe you would consider other options. And I know [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3788.56s)]
*  people at large organizations that have done that because there's an open source competitor to it. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3792.7200000000003s)]
*  So that does exist in the world. Okay. But what Freeberg is bringing up is like, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3797.2799999999997s)]
*  why would you support 500,000 to million dollar a year OpEx for software? I mean, can you really [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3800.8799999999997s)]
*  put a model together that shows that that's somehow a creative team, especially if you're [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3810.0s)]
*  a money losing startup? It just doesn't make any logical sense. I understand that it happens. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3814.3199999999997s)]
*  And the fact that that software SaaS companies have been able to make 80 to 90% margins and [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3819.04s)]
*  grow on that, it has created the best business model in history. But I think what may become [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3823.76s)]
*  apparent now is that the SaaS business model is really a temporary phenomenon that existed [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3828.4s)]
*  between ubiquity of the internet and the development of AI and low cost, low code tools [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3834.2400000000002s)]
*  for developing software. Yeah. It was an arbitrage of the dearth of engineers. It was the gross [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3840.0s)]
*  margin that was correlated to the lack of engineers. And now that the work that software engineers [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3844.7200000000003s)]
*  could have done has been automated into software itself, you are going to see a lot of that [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3849.68s)]
*  arbitrage say differently. Freeberg, you could say like the number of engineers has now [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3855.2s)]
*  multiplied by a million fold. That's right. And now everyone has them available. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3860.24s)]
*  So then the gross margins were not going to be 90%. The gross margins may be 30%. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3864.8799999999997s)]
*  So everything gets competed away and pricing goes down, pricing gets compressed. And that's why [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3869.12s)]
*  this is a big macro trend for me. And I'm just seeing it across every company. Everyone's [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3873.3599999999997s)]
*  rethinking whether or not to pay the seat fees for all different types of software tools. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3877.52s)]
*  By the way, the part of that, which is economically true, is if you look at every other category in [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3881.36s)]
*  the economy, and you look at the gross margin profile of businesses that are not pure play tech, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3886.96s)]
*  we have grown up and we've monetized this belief that tech companies not only can start at 80 to 90%, [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3893.04s)]
*  but stay there indefinitely. Stay there. Yeah, they should be at 40%. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3899.92s)]
*  Not even every other market can start off in the 50, 60, 70% when they're nascent, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3903.36s)]
*  but capitalism competes away those margins down to 30 to 40%. And a best in class business generates [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3908.1600000000003s)]
*  20 to 25% EBITDA margins on a sustained basis. So if you believe that the average best run company [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3915.04s)]
*  is a 35% gross margin business with 20 to 25% free cash flow margins, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3922.32s)]
*  tech stocks have a long way to go down. Exactly. Exactly. Software companies. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3927.6800000000003s)]
*  Software companies. But if it's priced below the cost of you rebuilding it, then you're not, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3933.2000000000003s)]
*  you're just, it's a buyer. No, no, no. But Jason, the point is, the point is like when somebody does [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3938.8s)]
*  that, so Friedberg's company did that work, he doesn't even need to want to make a profit from [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3943.36s)]
*  that software to just say, anybody else can use this. I have an auto GPT that will basically [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3948.6400000000003s)]
*  configure myself to you if you want to use it. And now that N plus first company who's starting up [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3954.32s)]
*  with two or three people can now raise an order of magnitude less money and will write the GPT [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3960.64s)]
*  that connects to his and now has this. So this is my point where like it just, it's, it's, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3966.48s)]
*  it's just a race to the bottom. Yeah. All right. Last year for our most anticipated trend, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3972.0s)]
*  Chamath and I both picked austerity. It feels like that came to fruition. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3978.16s)]
*  You're kidding, right? We did not see any austerity. We added like two trillion to the debt. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3984.3199999999997s)]
*  I was talking about consumers and companies and individuals. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3991.52s)]
*  Well, consumers didn't, didn't cut either. I mean, they kept spending and in fact, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=3994.7999999999997s)]
*  credit card debt is now at the highest level it's ever been. So where's the austerity? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4000.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, I think it's happening right now where people are maxed out. You're already starting [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4004.48s)]
*  to see it happen with travel and some of those areas, but yeah, we could be off by six months [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4009.04s)]
*  on this one. Saks, you said Trump's influence in the GOP wanes. That was definitely wrong. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4013.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. That was wishful thinking. Freberg, cell gene therapy. Wishful for you. Wishful for you [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4018.32s)]
*  too. You don't want him as your candidate. Well, I can explain that. I mean, at the end of 2022, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4024.56s)]
*  we had that election that was supposed to be a red wave and it turned into a red puddle. Remember [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4032.0800000000004s)]
*  that? And it was a big loser for the GOP and a lot of the candidates, I'd say in particular, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4035.76s)]
*  the candidates who had been endorsed and supported by Trump ended up losing and not doing very well. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4042.96s)]
*  And then by contrast, it seemed like the one part of the country where the Republicans had done [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4048.72s)]
*  incredibly well was in Florida, where obviously DeSantis won by like 20 points and added seats [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4053.36s)]
*  to their majority in the legislature. So it seemed like going into the year that [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4059.84s)]
*  DeSantis was kind of the heir apparent and Trump's influence would wane. But like you said, [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4065.68s)]
*  that may have been wishful thinking. That's clearly not what's happened. But a big part of [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4070.08s)]
*  the reason why Trump's influence is greater than ever is because of all this lawfare, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4073.84s)]
*  all these indictments against him and this prosecution and persecution of him by Biden [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4079.76s)]
*  and his minions. It's really, I think, galvanized the base to support Trump. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4085.76s)]
*  Freeburg, last year you said cell gene therapy becoming more mainstream. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4090.0s)]
*  How did that one pan out, your prediction? Most in Pistachian? [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4095.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't know about mainstream, but I mean, we've seen more approvals this year. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4099.4400000000005s)]
*  It's been good. I mean, steady, steady pace of progress. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4103.4400000000005s)]
*  We saw the Sickle Cell product come out. Sickle Cell came to market. Yep. There's a few more [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4106.88s)]
*  that got approved. So in cell therapy, so it's great. Yeah, we're seeing good progress there. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4110.400000000001s)]
*  And I remember there's like over a thousand in clinicals. So there's this tidal wave coming to [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4115.52s)]
*  market soon of cell and gene therapies. They're going to have a profound effect on a lot of [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4119.92s)]
*  disease conditions. So really exciting. Freeburg, you want to continue and tell [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4124.56s)]
*  us what you're most anticipating? Oh, so this year I'm really excited based on the [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4128.08s)]
*  progress we've seen in 2023 of predictive models, AI-driven discovery of novel molecules, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4132.0s)]
*  materials, and methods of production in biopharma, in chemical engineering, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4141.12s)]
*  lots of new materials and new drugs that are actually coming out of software, not coming out [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4148.72s)]
*  of brute force, wet lab discovery processing. And then we're also seeing these really amazing [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4154.56s)]
*  generative systems on production processes in chemistry that are going to unlock all of [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4160.08s)]
*  these new products and grow up costs. Going back to the deflationary point, not only does [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4165.6s)]
*  this introduce new products into the world that are going to benefit humanity, but it reduces the [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4169.36s)]
*  cost of making them and reduces the footprint of making them. So there's a lot of great [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4173.68s)]
*  benefit coming from these predictive modeling tools that's starting to percolate its way [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4178.0s)]
*  into these industries. So I'm excited about seeing what comes to market this year. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4181.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm sure we're going to have the science corner at some point this year that says, [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4184.5599999999995s)]
*  look at this amazing new thing that was discovered in software and it works. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4187.6s)]
*  And it's going to be really cool. Okay. What do you got your mouth for your [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4191.200000000001s)]
*  most anticipated trend of 2024? What are you most anticipating? I think this is the most important [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4195.68s)]
*  year for Bitcoin that has ever existed. We are probably days away from a series of ETFs being [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4200.8s)]
*  approved. And so this is the moment for Bitcoin to use that old term, cross the chasm and really [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4210.64s)]
*  see mainstream adoption where our parents and our grandparents understand what it is, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4220.72s)]
*  can buy it, and then do buy it. And I think that if all of this comes to pass, Bitcoin will be a [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4227.68s)]
*  part of the traditional financial lexicon by the end of 2024. So that is my most anticipated trend [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4234.72s)]
*  of the year. What do you got, Sax, for your most anticipated trend of the year, Sax? [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4241.68s)]
*  What Jamal said is a pretty good one. I think there's a version of that same thing in AI. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4246.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to know exactly what all the advancements are going to be in AI, but [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4250.400000000001s)]
*  when we look back on it in five or 10 years, it's going to be pretty clear that the exponential pace [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4255.92s)]
*  of advancement in AI continued. And so I can't say exactly what those breakthroughs are going to be [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4262.240000000001s)]
*  this year, but there certainly are going to be some. And I think we'll see those innovations [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4268.320000000001s)]
*  continue to percolate down to more and more of the average sort of mainstream consumer. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4273.84s)]
*  Saks, once again, you and I are simpatico. I picked my most anticipated trend of 2024 as [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4278.56s)]
*  efficiency in the form of AI advances and outsourcing. Basically, a lot of Americans [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4285.52s)]
*  don't want to work or they want to work from home or they want high salaries. We have record low [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4292.0s)]
*  unemployment. Thanks to Biden. I'm joking. But all of this is forcing people to build robots, AI [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4296.240000000001s)]
*  and software to route around and make things more efficient. And I think the number one trend I'm [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4304.96s)]
*  seeing from startups and they tend to adopt this stuff early is outsourcing to all other [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4312.32s)]
*  geographies around the world for work because it's so easy once you have a work from home [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4317.84s)]
*  philosophy or paradigm at your company. Well, adding somebody from Portugal, Manila, Argentina, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4323.92s)]
*  Canada is the same as adding somebody from outside of New York City or Silicon Valley or LA, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4330.32s)]
*  but you can do so at a third of the price for somebody maybe who really wants the work. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4335.679999999999s)]
*  And so I think efficiency is my most anticipated trend, but in the form of AI and outsourcing. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4341.76s)]
*  Okay. Now, media, everybody loves when we do our most anticipated media for 2024. For last year, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4348.16s)]
*  I had Oppenheimer. Wow, that was great. Chamath, you had Dune Part 2, that was delayed. Saks, [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4359.12s)]
*  you also had Oppenheimer. What did you think of Oppenheimer, Saks? Did it deliver for you? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4364.24s)]
*  Have you seen it? I thought it was good, not great. It was very long. It kind of went on and on. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4368.08s)]
*  It's not a movie I need to see a second time. Let's put it that way. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4374.16s)]
*  Okay. And Freeberg, you said generative AI based media. For this year, I have to confess, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4376.88s)]
*  I have inside information. So my prediction is going to be the winner. It turns out our favorite [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4383.12s)]
*  DJ is dropping a new album in 2024. And I got a release track. So my most anticipated media, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4390.96s)]
*  I'll just play the unreleased track here. What is this? According to NASA, [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4400.0s)]
*  there's a new look at Uranus. Uranus. Uranus. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4404.24s)]
*  Uranus. Uranus. Is this Young Spielberg? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4410.080000000001s)]
*  This is Young Spielberg. Coming at you. The summer jam of the year. Uranus. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4418.72s)]
*  It's a banger. There it is. Talk about my anus. Coming at you. That was a banger. He obviously [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4427.68s)]
*  likes the deep bass of my voice. He does like the deep bass of your voice in his anus. Yes. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4434.4s)]
*  So that's a banger. That's going to be, I think that that's going to carry, it's going to be the [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4440.24s)]
*  summer anthem. The new album from Young Spielberg dropping. That's the lead title track. Uranus. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4443.679999999999s)]
*  Coming at you. I also am looking forward to Gladiator 2 is coming out. Really, Scott. Lucius, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4450.0s)]
*  the nephew of Commodus is a grown man. It's going to be awesome, I hope. And Netflix's three body [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4455.839999999999s)]
*  problem. If you haven't read the books, they're great. And that's being done by the Game of Throne [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4461.2s)]
*  guys. That's going to come out in March. And that's going to be awesome. D&D. Anyway, three body [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4465.36s)]
*  problem. Gladiator 2 for me. Once the books ran out, they were kind of, they were kind of on their [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4472.96s)]
*  own there and the show kind of declined. It was a terrible last season. In this case, the three body [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4478.0s)]
*  problem is a complete series and it's mind blowing in terms of its epicness. Sax, what's your most [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4483.92s)]
*  anticipated media of 2024? Is there a Putin biography coming out? Is it Alex Jones's [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4489.04s)]
*  biography 10 part series on Netflix? What do you got? None of that. What are you looking forward to? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4496.0s)]
*  Well, I agree with you about Gladiator 2. We actually have similar chase in movies. I'm also [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4500.4s)]
*  looking forward to House of the Dragon season 2. Oh, yes. But one project I will give a little plug [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4504.96s)]
*  to is Jimmy Sony's book, The Founders, which is the story of PayPal and the entrepreneurs who shaped [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4510.88s)]
*  Silicon Valley. This is a book that came out in 2022. The reason I'm mentioning it is because [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4516.96s)]
*  I optioned this book along with Jack Selby, who's another PayPal mafia alum who has a film company. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4522.32s)]
*  And so we've optioned this and we have just made a deal with Drake's company called Dream Crew [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4529.28s)]
*  to turn this into some sort of television series. Could be done as a docu- [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4534.64s)]
*  Wait, did you say Drake, the musician Drake? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4539.28s)]
*  Yeah. He actually has a very successful production company called Dream Crew. They're the producers [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4541.28s)]
*  of Euphoria, which is this huge hit on HBO. Terrifying. So they've decided to- it is kind [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4546.4s)]
*  of a terrifying show. If you have kids, it's terrifying. It is terrifying. Incredible show, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4552.16s)]
*  terrifying. It's an incredible show, but terrifying and yeah, it is scary. In any [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4557.04s)]
*  event, it's a big hit. So they produce a lot of not just music, but television content. They're [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4560.799999999999s)]
*  very interested in the story. And so we're partnering with them to create a TV show. So hopefully that [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4567.36s)]
*  comes together this year. Are you in production this year on it or is it- [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4572.16s)]
*  No, it's going into development this year. Hopefully. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4574.96s)]
*  You get an EP credit tax? [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4577.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4579.68s)]
*  Oh, how much does it cost for the rest of us to get EP credits? [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4580.24s)]
*  50 grand. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4583.92s)]
*  Yeah. Is it a 50 grander or is it- [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4584.8s)]
*  No, it's 50. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4588.0s)]
*  Take a little. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4589.04s)]
*  This is going to be an expensive one. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4589.68s)]
*  Oh, really? Well, who's your dream? Is it HBO? Is it Dream or Netflix? [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4592.64s)]
*  Yeah, who funds production? [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4596.24s)]
*  Ultimately, a studio would make this. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4597.68s)]
*  Right. You would want HBO or Netflix, I take it. Those are the top two in terms of making high [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4599.28s)]
*  quality stuff. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4603.76s)]
*  They would be really good. Yeah. It doesn't have to be those two, but they'd be good. It could be [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4604.400000000001s)]
*  Amazon Prime. I mean, there's a lot of these. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4607.6s)]
*  And who are you hoping plays a young sax? Who would play a young sax? [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4609.280000000001s)]
*  Good question. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4614.24s)]
*  That's a good question. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4615.04s)]
*  Who would play a young David Sax? [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4616.16s)]
*  What's the name of the guy that's dating Zendaya? What's his name? Tom Holland. How about that? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4618.88s)]

*  Peter Parker. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4624.96s)]

*  Only one guy can play a young sax, that it would be Ryan Gosling. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4629.04s)]
*  Well, you guys are really shooting the moon with us. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4632.5599999999995s)]

*  Jake L is busy on the internet right now. He's going to give you a... [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4637.28s)]
*  No, I'm looking. I'm looking on the internet for a young actor to play a young sax. Well, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4639.36s)]
*  let the audience come back to that. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4643.2s)]
*  Let the audience decide who plays a young sax. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4644.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Chabath, you looking forward to anything in media in 2024? [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4647.2s)]

*  Jimmy Donaldson, MrBeast, added 100 million subscribers on YouTube in 2023. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4654.08s)]
*  More than two times the next largest channel. And if you watch his content, MrBeast channel, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4659.36s)]
*  it's incredible. And that has become event-based viewing now for hundreds of millions of people. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4666.32s)]
*  So I am really excited to see what production value gets cranked out in 2024 from these guys. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4673.759999999999s)]

*  I mean, I put AI generated news, which I think has become like an interesting... Have you guys [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4692.72s)]
*  seen these where there's like a broadcaster that just tells you the news and they're like naked? [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4697.84s)]
*  I haven't seen that. No. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4703.12s)]
*  That was the thing in the early days of the internet, right? Wasn't there like [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4704.400000000001s)]

*  It was like naked news. That was like naked news where like these people would be like in [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4710.4800000000005s)]
*  the process of undressing as they like read the news. It was so stupid. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4714.24s)]
*  Oh, really? It was really dumb, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4720.16s)]
*  but it did capture people's imagination. Naked news. You could basically watch newscasters, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4722.0s)]
*  naked, read the news. I do think you're going to see a lot of [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4727.36s)]
*  this real-time generative video that's going to take as its input news feeds and develop some [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4729.44s)]
*  understanding and then present it back to you in whatever visual format you want. And so you'll [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4736.88s)]
*  have your own personal newscaster presenting you the stuff that's interesting and be like, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4741.76s)]
*  no, no, no, tell me less about the Middle East. Tell me more about Wall Street. Tell me more [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4744.96s)]
*  about tech. And you can basically interact with it and curate your own personal newsfeed, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4748.320000000001s)]
*  whether that's through video or through text or through audio, you can have it [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4753.280000000001s)]

*  So I don't have to do scroll through Twitter all the time to get news. And I can have [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4760.0s)]
*  a personally curated newscaster. To your point, one of the things that... [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4764.400000000001s)]
*  One of the tasks that I had this year was to kind of like take a model and learn how to fine tune [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4769.84s)]
*  it. And Sunny and I, we took stable diffusion and there's a mod to it called Juggernaut XL, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4774.0s)]
*  which basically produces the most beautiful people you've ever seen. Like under any boundary [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4780.56s)]
*  condition, it doesn't matter what prompt you give. The people that it generates are the most [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4785.84s)]
*  stunningly symmetrically beautiful people. And all it's going to take to your point is to just [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4791.2s)]
*  put this stuff together next year and you'll have these people that capture your attention [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4797.28s)]
*  and can keep your attention and they'll tell you the news or whatever. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4802.32s)]
*  And you can just say skip. You can say, tell me more. You can say, go back. You can say, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4805.599999999999s)]
*  hey, I want to hear more. Like double click on that story and interact with it. It's going to [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4809.92s)]
*  be incredible. I do think it's going to happen in 2024 where a series of products will come out that [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4813.84s)]
*  start to look like this and it'll get... In terms of objective news, if that, as they're [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4818.639999999999s)]
*  telling the news, you can have another agent that's basically scoring it and telling you how [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4823.52s)]
*  biased it is. By the way, I'll tell you a crazy story. Yesterday, after Jason took Nat and I out [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4827.52s)]
*  yesterday, we had an epic day. It was incredible. It was fun. Good times. I was totally gassed, [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4834.88s)]
*  skinked. And so I took a nap and I fell asleep for like 40 minutes and I woke up and I turned on the [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4840.080000000001s)]
*  TV and I watched CNN for 20 minutes. Have you guys watched CNN? I can't watch more than a minute. It [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4845.84s)]
*  is so bad. It is for stupid people. All network news. Yeah. All network news is done. No, it's [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4852.32s)]
*  really bad, Jason. Like how biased it is and just how inaccurate it is. If you were to watch it for [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4857.28s)]
*  an hour a day, you would have this totally lopsided view of what's going on in the world that is [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4863.92s)]
*  completely not accurate. But here's my point. There's nobody fact checking CNN, just like [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4868.719999999999s)]
*  there's nobody really fact checking Fox News. But my thought is these models and these AI tools [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4872.5599999999995s)]
*  should be the thing that presents objective news and then actually just tells the truth. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4877.12s)]
*  I disagree. I think what will happen is people will bias the delivery to what they want to hear [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4881.28s)]
*  and you'll end up having something that's going to become more of an echo chamber for you. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4886.4s)]
*  I want to hear more about how X, Y, or Z is so great. I want to hear less about the stuff that [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4890.32s)]
*  I don't agree with. And you're going to curate your news to exactly what's happened with social [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4894.16s)]
*  media. So I don't know if that's necessarily how this will evolve too much because people don't [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4897.92s)]
*  like to hear what they don't believe or what they don't already know. You mean they don't want to [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4901.5199999999995s)]
*  hear the truth? Yeah. They want to hear the truth that speaks to them, their version of the truth. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4904.96s)]
*  They want to be emotionally titillated. You know, it's about time I let you guys know that we ran [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4910.32s)]
*  an experiment right now, Chamath and Freberg. I did this with Sax's permission, but Sax's [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4915.04s)]
*  participation here today was actually his AI. This is an AI version of Sax that we programmed. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4919.92s)]
*  AI Sax, can you reveal yourself and what training data went into this version of AI Sax? Can you [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4925.360000000001s)]
*  give us something about your training data? AI Sax, what training data was used? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4932.24s)]
*  If this is a bit you want to do, you're going to have to give me more of a heads up. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4937.2s)]
*  That would be hilarious though if we actually trained like a Sax model and we had him come on [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4942.400000000001s)]
*  and we tried to fool the audience. Can we just do a quick round table? If you guys were to summarize [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4946.88s)]
*  your, in one word or two words, your emotional condition for 2024, what would it be? Like, [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4951.76s)]
*  how are you feeling going into 2024? Sax? Oh, I feel fine. But if I were to describe [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4957.84s)]
*  24 in one word, I would say the year's going to be turbulent. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4962.48s)]
*  Turbulent? But I feel level, it's not me, but I feel like the world's going to be very turbulent. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4966.08s)]
*  J. Cal? Kind of exhilarated, enthusiastic about 2024. It feels like a lot of the cleanup work [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4972.5599999999995s)]
*  that we had to do in 2023, 2022. I feel like a lot of that we've worked through it. And I'm finding [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4981.679999999999s)]
*  a lot of optimistic. So I guess that would be, you know, enthusiastic and optimistic about 2024. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4991.36s)]
*  I'm really excited to go to work and create. I want to create some new things in 2024. I feel [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=4996.48s)]
*  very creative, creative. Yeah. Yeah. Creative. I would say cautious and pensive. I think that [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5001.44s)]
*  just a lot of stuff is changing underfoot. And I'm personally not excited to make a bunch of decisions [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5008.799999999999s)]
*  because I worry that those decisions will have to be remade or unmade even nine or 10 months later. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5019.360000000001s)]
*  So I'm just kind of like very pensive. I'm like, wow, a lot of stuff can change, will change. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5025.92s)]
*  Even just like, you know, and then Freebird knows this, but like, you know, there's like some deals [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5037.6s)]
*  underfoot that like I think for the industry as a lot like as a whole are just really meaningful [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5040.8s)]
*  things. And so to do stuff right now, Freebird makes me very anxious. So, right. I'm really [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5045.6s)]
*  cautious and pensive. Right. Where are you at Freebird? I'm excited. I'm enjoying my new [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5051.280000000001s)]
*  job as CEO at Oholo. There's so much cool stuff happening. I'm personally excited about it. So [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5058.0s)]
*  this is the most excited I've felt in many years in terms of my work. And then I would, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5062.08s)]
*  and I'm really excited to share what we've done next year, which I'll, or earlier this year, [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5067.76s)]
*  I'll do it on the show first, obviously. And then looking outside of the world, I'm just [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5071.92s)]
*  a little cautious. I'm a little nervous. I think there's a like, there's still a lot of [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5076.48s)]
*  tinderboxes out there. So I mean, you guys know, like we joke about it, but I do think there's [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5080.0s)]
*  these like little mouse traps that can get set off and then they set up all the other mouse traps. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5085.12s)]
*  So there's a couple of those things out there that I'm a little nervous about. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5089.76s)]
*  But in the course of history, aren't there always conflicts in the world? And like, do you try to [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5092.32s)]
*  like put them on a spectrum of like, there's always going to be conflict, there's always going to be [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5097.2s)]
*  There's never been this much debt in the world. And that's what makes me so nervous. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5100.8s)]
*  Yeah, no. And I think they're related. So actual conflict relates to the debt load. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5104.72s)]
*  And that's why I'm so nervous, because we've never been, you can't keep your societal fabric [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5110.400000000001s)]
*  together. If you have a lot of debt, and you can't grow your economy. Those are two, that's a simple [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5115.76s)]
*  fact. And so that leads naturally to finding points of conflict with other nations and other [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5120.64s)]
*  places. Because, you know, you look for conflict elsewhere, there's a good chance that [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5126.16s)]
*  will the republicans will force some momentary temporary budget cuts in this next. Yeah. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5132.4s)]
*  Couple weeks. Shutdown. Yeah, a couple weeks. Yeah. 17. Two weeks away. Yeah. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5138.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty interesting. Under the terms of the debt ceiling increase that they [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5142.4s)]
*  agreed to last year, they're supposed to all agree on a new budget. And if they don't, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5146.96s)]
*  then there's a 1% cut across the board on discretionary spending that goes into effect. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5152.320000000001s)]
*  Right. If I were the republicans, why agree to a deal? You're never gonna do better than a 1% [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5156.88s)]
*  cut in discretionary spending. If you care about austerity, or just having any kind of reason in [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5162.16s)]
*  our spending, just take the 1% cut. Don't agree to anything. Agreed. That's the most likely path, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5168.0s)]
*  right? At this point. I hope so. And you know, 1% cut is a rounding error. But the [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5173.68s)]
*  Washington elites are gonna shriek like crazy over that. I mean, they're gonna squeal over [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5178.64s)]
*  this minuscule cut, like we were slashing their budgets. Right. But that's all we're cutting [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5183.84s)]
*  their arm and I think. Yeah, exactly. They're cutting their fingernail and they're crying. It's [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5189.04s)]
*  like just clip your toenails. They're gonna have to get off their arm when they got like a fingernail [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5193.280000000001s)]
*  clip. Yeah, it's nothing. All right, I gotta run. All right, everybody. What an amazing 2023 we had. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5198.08s)]
*  Here's to a great 2024. You got your prediction show and we'll be back with more news and a [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5204.24s)]
*  classic all-in episode next week. Have a great new year and we wish you all the best in 2024. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5209.28s)]
*  Love you, boys. Bye-bye. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5215.92s)]
*  I'm doing all this. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8T71m7Ics&t=5264.24s)]
