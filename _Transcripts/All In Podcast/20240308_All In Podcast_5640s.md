# E169 Elon sues OpenAI, Apple's decline, TikTok ban, Bitcoin $100K?, Science corner Microplastics
**All In Podcast:** [March 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo)
*  Chamath, who are you giggling with? Are you with your kids? What's going on here? You're [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=0.0s)]
*  making good I got it. I got a message from no, she's like, help me. No, no, I got a message [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3.6s)]
*  from that. She's so funny. So you know, I was like, blah, blah, blah. She did a Uranus [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=9.48s)]
*  joke into my chat. I lost it. It is like a free but I go it says that your anus is right [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=15.72s)]
*  there at the edge of the she's like, no, she's like, Are you hungry? I could eat a Uranus. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=24.48s)]
*  Oh, no, we could go to a great restaurant to Uranus. They have a great meal. They have [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=29.92s)]
*  a great chocolate lava cake. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  All right, everybody, welcome back to your favorite podcast of all time. It's Episode [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=38.32s)]
*  169 of all in with me again, the Chairman Dictator Chamath Palihapitiya, David Freeberg, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=60.84s)]
*  the Sultan of Science and the Rain Man. Yeah, definitely David Sachs has his Montclair [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=68.28s)]
*  hat back again. I guess they're back in stock. How we doing boys? Welcome back to the show. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=74.6s)]
*  Let's get to the docket here. Issue one Elon has sued Open AI begun the meme wars have [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=79.4s)]
*  after we finished the recording last week. The memes are incredible. After we finished [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=86.08s)]
*  recording last week, Elon sued Sam Waltman, Greg Brockman and the Open AI organization. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=91.2s)]
*  He's suing for breach of contract, fiduciary duty and unfair competition. And his argument [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=96.2s)]
*  is basically Open AI started as an open source nonprofit. As you know, he gave them something [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=101.44s)]
*  like 50 or 75 million for both those numbers quoted. And then of course, everybody knows [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=105.92s)]
*  opening I turned into closed AI that became a closed source for profit venture after the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=110.88s)]
*  tech was deployed. This enabled them obviously to benefit from tax, nonprofit tax breaks [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=115.68s)]
*  while building the tech. But they now have two corporate entities. There's this nonprofit [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=122.9s)]
*  called Open AI. There's a for profit. It's called Open AI Global LLC that was created [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=128.1s)]
*  in 2019. And there's all this funky relationship between the two. We'll get into that because [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=132.26s)]
*  it's kind of interesting actually. Elon said that if Open AI is allowed to do this, then [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=137.26s)]
*  it should be the standard for every company going forward. That's an interesting point. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=141.42000000000002s)]
*  You can start by donating money to a nonprofit and then make a for profit. It seems pretty [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=144.58s)]
*  capital efficient. So what does Elon want to get out of this? According to the lawsuit, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=147.70000000000002s)]
*  he wants Open AI to open source their models. By the way, that's what Facebook and Apple [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=151.84s)]
*  are doing right now. So that seems more than reasonable since that's how the company was [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=155.84s)]
*  formed. And he wants to make sure that shareholders receive no financial benefit from Open AI. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=159.96s)]
*  And we can get more into a bunch of the Open AI nonprofit status and their structure. It's [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=167.56s)]
*  super convoluted. But I want to just get your initial reaction, Sax. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=173.2s)]
*  I haven't read the legal filings, Jason. My knowledge of the case is just coming from [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=178.16s)]
*  following what's on Twitter. And the last time I commented on one of Elon's lawsuits [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=181.94s)]
*  on this pod, I ended up in six hours of deposition. So remember that was the whole Twitter lawsuit. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  In any event, my understanding of the case from the tweets that are flying back and forth [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  is I think Elon is making two points. One is that when Open AI was set up, it was set [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=202.52s)]
*  up to be a nonprofit and to promote AI as an open source technology that everyone could [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=209.08s)]
*  benefit from and no one large tech company would control. In that case, Elon was primarily [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=215.76000000000002s)]
*  concerned about Google. I think now he's more concerned about Microsoft. Nonetheless, the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  idea was that this would be open source. So I think point number one is Elon feels like [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=226.68s)]
*  the rug was pulled out from under him after he donated 40 something million dollars to [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=232.52s)]
*  this. They completely changed what it was going to be. And I think he's used the word [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  swindled before. He feels like he was cheated. And I think usually when there's a lawsuit [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  like this, it's usually because somebody does feel fundamentally cheated by what happened. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  So I think that's the first point. The second is that I think that Elon's making is, well, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=252.34s)]
*  wait a second. If you can start a company as a nonprofit using pre-tax dollars and then [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=256.6s)]
*  all of a sudden convert to for-profit, then why wouldn't everybody do this in order to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=263.48s)]
*  circumvent paying taxes? And I think that's another, I'd say, valid and interesting point [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  that he's made. Now, Open AI has responded to this by publishing some of Elon's emails [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=271.8s)]
*  to them and they think that they have a smoking gun here because apparently Elon told them [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=277.76000000000005s)]
*  they need to raise far more money in order to have a chance of taking on Google slash [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=283.48s)]
*  DeepMind. I just don't know whether that's the smoking gun they claim it is, but that's [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=288.56s)]
*  basically what they're putting out there. And then to add fuel to the fire, you've got [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=292.56s)]
*  VCs coming over the top debating different aspects of this. You've got Vinod defending [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=297.8s)]
*  Open AI. He was the first VC investor in it. And so he's been out there attacking Elon. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  I think Mark Andreessen is responding to Vinod and maybe I don't know if he's exactly defending [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=309.0s)]
*  Elon. Anyway, it's turned into a whole maelstrom on X and then everyone else is starting to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=316.6s)]
*  put out a whole bunch of crazy memes. So I don't know who's going to win this case in court, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=323.32s)]
*  but the memes are definitely lit. And maybe the funniest one is that Elon has said that [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=328.36s)]
*  if Open AI will simply change their name to closed AI, he'll drop the lawsuit. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=336.6s)]
*  I think he's serious about that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=340.36s)]
*  I think he is serious about it. But I think he's making his point, which is you ended up doing [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=342.20000000000005s)]
*  something different than what you told me when you got me to write this big donation and when [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=348.04s)]
*  we co-founded this thing together. So I think that sort of sums up Elon's position on this. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  Chamath, a year from now, where do you think we'll be with this? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=360.68s)]
*  Well, I think there's one more thing, which is that they used his name pretty aggressively [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=364.20000000000005s)]
*  to get more money. And he was very instrumental in getting some of the early critical hires, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=372.20000000000005s)]
*  particularly Ilya, which has been, I think, well documented Tsutskever to leave Google. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=378.20000000000005s)]
*  So that's probably, Sachs, where also some of this feeling that he was bamboozled comes from. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=384.20000000000005s)]
*  But I think that all of those emotions matter less than the rule of law, which is his second point, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  which is the important point. Irrespective of whatever one email says or another email, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=399.64s)]
*  it's not great for the US tax system if all of a sudden a big gaping loophole is identified and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=404.84s)]
*  taken advantage of. I think that there's a huge economic incentive for the state of California, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=411.4s)]
*  every other state where these Open AI employees lived and have gotten equity and now have gotten [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=418.03999999999996s)]
*  paid. There's an incentive for Treasury. There's an incentive for the IRS. It touches a lot of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=422.68s)]
*  aspects of very complicated tax law. And so I think that's why there will be a resolution to this case, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=430.04s)]
*  because I think that that answer is very important. And I think it will, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=438.36s)]
*  as he has correctly identified, motivate a lot of people's actions going forward. So independent of [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=442.12s)]
*  what the emotional situation is amongst all the actors in this play, the reality is he's identified [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=449.40000000000003s)]
*  a loophole and that loophole needs to get fixed. I'll give you a different example of this that's [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=455.88s)]
*  much more benign, but it dragged on for eight or nine years. At Facebook, there was a period where, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=460.28000000000003s)]
*  and this was public so I can tell you, we transferred a lot of our IP to Ireland at one moment, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=466.68s)]
*  and there was a transfer payment and whatnot. And then a few years afterwards, when everybody [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=474.12s)]
*  realized, including us, and we had miscalculated, but when everybody realized the value of Facebook, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=479.64s)]
*  that transfer payment did not seem correct. And it was a huge tax arb that we had facilitated, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=485.16s)]
*  because all of that IP sitting inside of Ireland gets taxed at a very different rate than that IP [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=492.12s)]
*  would have gotten taxed in the United States. And other companies had copied this. Long story short, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=498.68s)]
*  the IRS sued. Similar to you, David, I was in years of depositions and interviews and all of [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=503.24s)]
*  this stuff. So the point is that the government really cares about these kinds of things because [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=509.32s)]
*  so much money is on the line. And if OpenAI turns out to be this multi-hundred billion dollar behemoth, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=514.6s)]
*  this will get figured out in court because there's just too much money at stake. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=521.8s)]
*  Friedberg, any thoughts? And maybe Steelman, if you feel like it, OpenAI's position? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=526.28s)]
*  I think we're all ignoring the documents that OpenAI put out yesterday showing emails and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=534.04s)]
*  interactions with Elon, where Elon acknowledged and recognized the necessity of having a for-profit [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=540.04s)]
*  subsidiary that could pursue the interests of the foundation by raising billions of dollars [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=546.8399999999999s)]
*  of outside capital. I think it's a really interesting set of facts that [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=554.6s)]
*  provides a different light on the story. And it was really important that OpenAI released it. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=561.64s)]
*  I'm going to share a- Hold on, Friedberg. I did mention that. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=565.8000000000001s)]
*  Friedberg, I mentioned that too. My point is it doesn't allow you to break the law. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=569.16s)]
*  Yeah. So let me just tell you guys a little bit about another example. My sister works at [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=572.6800000000001s)]
*  a nonprofit called the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Cystic Fibrosis is an inherited disorder. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=579.1600000000001s)]
*  It affects the lungs and digestive tract. It's debilitating, really affects children. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=584.84s)]
*  There was a nonprofit called the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation established in 1955. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=592.2s)]
*  They did tons of work on drug development research, and it was a nonprofit for years [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=596.28s)]
*  until they realized that there needed to be a market-based system to create the necessary [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=599.88s)]
*  incentives to drive the capital needed to find a drug that could cure cystic fibrosis. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=603.72s)]
*  And in the year 2000, they invested out of their foundation endowment, $40 million in a company [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=609.32s)]
*  called Aurora Biosciences. Subsequently, it was acquired by Vertex, and they continued to [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=616.2800000000001s)]
*  invest another $60 million. So a total of a hundred million bucks in the lifetime of the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=620.9200000000001s)]
*  development of a drug that could cure this disease. In 2005, a drug was discovered, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=625.32s)]
*  and in 2012, the FDA approved it. The nonprofit then sold their rights, their interest [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=632.2s)]
*  in this for-profit entity for $3.3 billion. It was an incredible return. It was the largest [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=638.28s)]
*  investment return by a nonprofit in history. Who do they sell it to? Back to the company? [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=646.28s)]
*  I actually think they sold the rights to Royalty Pharma, who you and I know well. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=652.6s)]
*  And that $3.3 billion opened up this ability for them to continue to make investments. They now [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=657.3199999999999s)]
*  fund biotech VCs, and they make direct investments and other things. But it really set the benchmark [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=662.92s)]
*  for this concept of what's called venture philanthropy, where a nonprofit parent company [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=667.88s)]
*  can make investments in for-profits that can raise additional capital that's needed to pursue the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=672.36s)]
*  broad, difficult interests of the nonprofit. And I think that this argument really kind of ties into [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=678.68s)]
*  what happened with OpenAI. And you can see it in the email exchanges with Elon, where he was so [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=684.36s)]
*  prescient that I give Elon extraordinary credit for this, that he saw that this is going to take [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=688.92s)]
*  billions of dollars a year of investment to realize the pursuit that OpenAI was going after. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=692.84s)]
*  And there was no way that Elon was going to be able to generate that cash himself, or that Reed, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=697.5600000000001s)]
*  or others were going to just be able to pony up that money. They needed to have some sort of [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=701.5600000000001s)]
*  for-profit vehicle that would allow the market to work and allow capitalists to find their [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=705.24s)]
*  capital into this organization to make this investment interest. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=710.2s)]
*  So I think the real question with respect to is OpenAI in trouble as a foundation, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=713.48s)]
*  is does the nonprofit own a meaningful piece of the for-profit entity? And I don't know the [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=719.5600000000001s)]
*  answer to that. I don't know if you guys do. It sounds like it. I mean, yeah, it must, right? [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=724.92s)]
*  So if they do, then they have an investment interest. The second question is, does the [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=728.76s)]
*  nonprofit parent still do charitable stuff? Because if it doesn't, then there's a real [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=732.36s)]
*  question on the nonprofit status. I think you have to have a certain amount of your assets deployed [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=738.52s)]
*  every year in order to qualify for 501c3. So I think the test in the courts will likely end up [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=742.5999999999999s)]
*  being, look, it's totally reasonable to have a for-profit entity, to fund a for-profit entity. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=748.36s)]
*  Other nonprofits have done it, particularly when you need to attract billions of dollars [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=752.44s)]
*  of outside capital to make it work. The real question is, does the nonprofit still do nonprofit [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=756.0400000000001s)]
*  stuff? That's an interesting question because, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=760.12s)]
*  Friber, do you think that when they booted off the nonprofit experts from the board, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=762.5200000000001s)]
*  that they may have crossed a tripwire there? Yes. Yeah, I'm the lawyer. I'm the lawyer. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=771.0s)]
*  That's a great question. I did a little journalism and I talked to [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=775.6400000000001s)]
*  a couple of people who are in and around two other of these scenarios. One of the key issues here [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=778.92s)]
*  is that the IP, in your example, Friberg, it wasn't like that cystic fibrosis organization [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=783.56s)]
*  did the drug discovery, right? They didn't do it, correct? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=790.04s)]
*  Well, I think they handed over some research that was open to the public at the time, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=793.96s)]
*  and they funded an independent for-profit. And so what happened here was you had the [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=798.92s)]
*  IP and the employees of the nonprofit gifted, they were transferred over to the for-profit [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=804.52s)]
*  organization. And when the Mozilla Foundation did this and another company called Sama Source, [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=809.48s)]
*  and these both have two structures, a nonprofit and a for-profit. But in both of their cases, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=815.96s)]
*  they set up separate boards. And the two different boards answer to the for-profit concerns and the [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=823.0s)]
*  nonprofit concerns. They also didn't give huge chunks of equity to all of the employees, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=828.9200000000001s)]
*  which then sold them in secondary. So what's happened here is all of the IP in all likelihood [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=834.12s)]
*  has been, and the wealth transfer has gone to all these employees, they've now done a secondary. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=840.6s)]
*  And this actually triggers a lot of IRS investigations. The Mozilla Foundation, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=846.0400000000001s)]
*  which was making the Netscape browser, which many of you probably have used over the years, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=851.96s)]
*  they were making hundreds of millions of dollars a year, David, from advertising with Google. The [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=856.2s)]
*  IRS said, Hey, wait a second, you look like a for-profit to us. So they made a for-profit [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=860.04s)]
*  entity. And Mitchell Baker and the team over there set this up. So all the money went back [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=864.4399999999999s)]
*  into the Mozilla Foundation and their nonprofit efforts. And they just paid above market salaries. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=871.72s)]
*  But it was very important that these things be separated and that the employees not have equity [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=880.52s)]
*  and that all that money flowed back up. And I think this is where OpenAI is going to get super [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=885.16s)]
*  tripped up. And I think the IRS is going to have a field day here. Here's the Nick, can you please [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=888.92s)]
*  throw the image up? This is from the OpenAI website that explains their structure. So [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=893.64s)]
*  let's just speculate for a second because we're, we're just guessing, but [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=899.48s)]
*  it has been reported that Microsoft owns 49% of the entire company. And that's a lot. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=903.72s)]
*  So Microsoft owns 49%, right? That's the number of the for-profit. In this example, Microsoft, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=909.16s)]
*  where it says minority economic interest, that number there would be 49. And that's what they [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=916.68s)]
*  own of this OpenAI global LLC. And the majority owner is this holding company. Okay. So that [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=921.16s)]
*  means 51% is there, but it says here that that 51% is owned by a combination of the nonprofit, [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=928.2s)]
*  employees and investors. So the question is back to Sachs's question, we can know very precisely [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=935.24s)]
*  how much the, the nonprofit owns by just X-ing out the investors and employees. And I'm going to [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=941.72s)]
*  guess it's at least 30 or 40%. I think that that's probably a pretty reasonable guess. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=949.72s)]
*  So it means that the OpenAI foundation probably owns somewhere between five to 20%. Is that fairly [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=955.64s)]
*  reasonable guess at the maximum? That seems right. Yeah. And so I think that they're going [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=963.0s)]
*  to have to show that ownership structure and decompose all these entities and show the actual [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=970.04s)]
*  percentages. If it's a lot less than that, if it's say like a 1% thing, then it's a little bit more [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=975.08s)]
*  sketch, I think. But if it's really like 15 or 20%, they're still going to have to prove that all of [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=982.12s)]
*  this was done in a, in a clean way. Because the big thing that these guys did was because by [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=989.08s)]
*  creating this LPGP structure and these cap profits, it's clear that they were trying to avoid something. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=994.76s)]
*  And the question is, in the discovery, will everybody learn what it is that they were trying [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1002.12s)]
*  to avoid? Because I've been through this, I think Sachs, you've been through it, Freberg, you were [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1007.1600000000001s)]
*  through it. When you set up these large vehicles and pooled amounts of money, folks come out of the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1011.5600000000001s)]
*  woodwork with all kinds of convoluted structures. And the discipline is always to tell these lawyers [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1017.96s)]
*  and accountants no. And they'll be like, let's set up a master feeder, and you'll go through Bermuda [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1022.6s)]
*  and this and that. And, and it's so easy to say yes, because it's very seductive what they're [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1028.04s)]
*  selling you. But it's always about trying to avoid something. So the real question is, why this [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1033.24s)]
*  convoluted structure? What was it trying to avoid? And where did this IP come from? Like all that IP, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1038.3600000000001s)]
*  Sachs, came from a nonprofit, all those employees worked for the nonprofit, then they decided to go [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1044.6s)]
*  from an open source model to closed. And then by doing that, they capture all the value. And then [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1050.12s)]
*  it's gifted to these employees and this investor base. That's where I think something doesn't seem [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1056.1999999999998s)]
*  right. Well, it's important to remember the majority of the IP that exists at OpenAI today [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1062.6799999999998s)]
*  was generated after the for-profit was set up. The real question was, there a fair transfer at [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1068.1999999999998s)]
*  the time when it was set up a value into this for-profit entity. And my guess is that GP box [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1072.92s)]
*  that you just looked at, the compensation that they're earning through that GP box that the [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1078.28s)]
*  nonprofit earns is likely meant to be kind of a fair amount relative to what was contributed at [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1082.6000000000001s)]
*  the time. The real question for me still remains, what other nonprofit and charitable work does the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1089.5600000000002s)]
*  OpenAI 501C3 actually do? And if the answer is nothing, and it's just a shell nonprofit, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1095.8s)]
*  and under it, the only thing that it owns is a for-profit interest, then I think there's a [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1102.9199999999998s)]
*  real question on what's the activity. And I don't mean to speak out of turn on all this stuff. I [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1107.0s)]
*  don't know enough, but I think that's the only sort of lens I would kind of look at this stuff [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1110.9199999999998s)]
*  through. Sachs, you want to say something? Well, a couple of points. One is one of my contention [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1115.32s)]
*  has been never innovate on structure. All you do is create legal problems. There's a tried and true [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1120.6s)]
*  way of creating a startup, which is a C Corp. When you try to innovate on legal instead of product, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1126.12s)]
*  it almost always backfires. The second point here is I think OpenAI is a little bit of a damned if [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1133.08s)]
*  you do, damned if you don't situation. To go back to Freeberg's point about the nonprofits sitting [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1140.04s)]
*  at the top there, remember what created all the problems when Sam briefly got fired as CEO and then [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1145.72s)]
*  came back is they had these directors from the nonprofit world who didn't really seem to [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1151.56s)]
*  understand how startups work. And so either they fired Sam for no reason, which was kind of [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1157.24s)]
*  incompetent, or they had a really good reason but didn't communicate it properly, which was also [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1163.88s)]
*  incompetent. Either way, that whole thing was a spectacle. And it just kind of showed that there [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1168.52s)]
*  was this culture clash going on between the for-profit company and the standard way of [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1174.44s)]
*  running a Silicon Valley startup to maximize the outcome, and then this nonprofit board that was [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1180.28s)]
*  sitting on top of the whole thing. So I think that now they're in the situation where they've [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1185.72s)]
*  changed that nonprofit board, they've booted off the nonprofit people, and that may have been the [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1192.52s)]
*  right thing for the for-profit entity, but now it might get them in trouble because it lends [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1200.6s)]
*  credence to Elon's lawsuit that they've completely changed the original mission of this organization. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1206.6799999999998s)]
*  It was supposed to be open source, and it was supposed to be [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1216.04s)]
*  nonprofit, and now it's for-profit and closed source. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1219.9599999999998s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Think about this, and again, we are speculating here, but if the mission was [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1222.1999999999998s)]
*  to be open source, and then you realize you've got something super valuable, and you closed source [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1227.32s)]
*  it, create a for-profit, and then take all the employees and all the IP and put it into the [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1232.84s)]
*  for-profit, lock it down, break the original mission that, hey, this was going to help humanity [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1238.04s)]
*  because we're going to make it open source. So if you donate money here and we get the tax exemption, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1242.84s)]
*  humanity benefits because everybody gets to look at that code at the same time and work on it [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1247.48s)]
*  and iterate. Now they've just basically stolen all that in order to enrich themselves, and I think [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1252.36s)]
*  then you add to it Sam maybe doing some deal making, which seems to be one of the triggers, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1258.36s)]
*  according to reports, and this OpenAI Venture Fund, et cetera. Maybe that deal making made [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1262.6799999999998s)]
*  the nonprofit people say, hey, listen, you're doing even more for-profit stuff with the OpenAI name. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1267.56s)]
*  We're supposed to be a nonprofit here. Aaron Ross Powell What's the venture fund thing? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1272.1999999999998s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell He started a venture fund to invest in companies called the OpenAI Ventures [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1274.9199999999998s)]
*  Fund, and he was the sole owner of it, which they're saying now it's a clerical mistake or [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1279.16s)]
*  something, but he's invested in a bunch of startups that have unique access to the OpenAI, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1283.88s)]
*  you know, I think- Aaron Ross Powell [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1290.1200000000001s)]
*  So I mean, he's the GP on behalf of OpenAI. Aaron Ross Powell [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1291.3200000000002s)]
*  The OpenAI.Fund, yes. Aaron Ross Powell [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1294.92s)]
*  No, but he's the GP on behalf of himself or on behalf of OpenAI? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1296.68s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell The way the paperwork was done, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1299.96s)]
*  it was on behalf of himself. They're now saying that that was done in error. So okay, fine, maybe [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1301.4s)]
*  it was, maybe it wasn't, who knows. Aaron Ross Powell [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1306.52s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait, the OpenAI Fund. Aaron Ross Powell [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1308.2s)]
*  Yes. Aaron Ross Powell [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1311.56s)]
*  Whose money is that? Aaron Ross Powell [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1312.84s)]
*  Sam raised money to create an OpenAI fund to invest in companies using OpenAI software. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1316.04s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Okay, so that's a different kind of issue. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1321.6399999999999s)]
*  That's called a corporate opportunity issue where OpenAI's fund- [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1324.84s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Self-dealing. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1329.48s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Self-dealing. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1330.04s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell It's basically a conflict of interest where [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1330.84s)]
*  the economic opportunity of the OpenAI Startup Fund should belong to OpenAI. If Sam created [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1334.76s)]
*  a separate fund with separate LPs that he's the GP of and gets economics in that, then that's a [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1339.8s)]
*  potential usurpation of a corporate opportunity. I don't know the truth of that matter. I'm just [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1345.32s)]
*  saying that's a slightly different issue. To go back to the point- [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1351.0s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell And it uses the OpenAI name. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1353.96s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Yeah, that's where the corporate opportunity becomes really explicit. To go back [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1355.32s)]
*  the point you were making a minute ago about the employees, I just think, you use the word stealing, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1361.48s)]
*  I think that's a really strong word. I think we have to complement the employees of this company, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1366.52s)]
*  if it is a company, including Sam, including Greg, including Ilya, for creating an amazing product. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1373.48s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Something incredible. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1380.04s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell They've created something incredible. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1381.0s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Absolutely. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1382.04s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell They've created, I think, an amazing ecosystem, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1382.6s)]
*  and there's a lot of developers building on top of this. I think no one is attacking their work. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1385.72s)]
*  I think it's a little too harsh to say that anyone's stealing anything because they have [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1391.88s)]
*  created all the value. The question, and I think you have to include Sam in that and say [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1395.0800000000002s)]
*  that he's done a great job as CEO because they've built something amazing. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1399.72s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell And, Sax, to your point, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1403.0800000000002s)]
*  it's not stealing because very smart investors are putting in money eyes wide open. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1404.6000000000001s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Yeah. I think that the criticism here is related to structure, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1409.16s)]
*  from my standpoint. It's related to structure. Whether Elon was told something at the beginning [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1413.72s)]
*  that's different, it got changed, and clearly it got changed in a way that was not consistent [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1419.56s)]
*  with the terms under which he initially contributed all this money. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1426.04s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Yeah. Mine is, I'm stating what [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1429.6399999999999s)]
*  is the most cynical interpretation of what happened here. There is the most benign and [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1434.76s)]
*  benevolent interpretation you could have as well, and maybe the truth is in between the two. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1440.6s)]
*  But the series of events that occurred does not look good when you have a mission to give [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1444.52s)]
*  this intellectual property to the world so no one person benefits from it. All of humanity is [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1449.48s)]
*  supposed to benefit from it. That was the point of being open source. Then you close it. Now, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1455.5600000000002s)]
*  who gets the benefit if it's closed? The employees. And that's going to be the crux of this. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1461.96s)]
*  Sam Bracewitz The investors. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1468.2s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell The investors. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1470.3600000000001s)]
*  Sam Bracewitz But that's how they were able to attract billions of dollars because you [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1471.88s)]
*  can't get billions of dollars to invest in something that's going to be open sourced. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1474.68s)]
*  And then the employees sell two billion in secondary. So now if you really want to take [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1478.9199999999998s)]
*  the most cynical approach to this or interpretation, again, this is just one interpretation, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1484.9199999999998s)]
*  they took an open source project, they closed it, they raised money, and then within the next two [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1490.76s)]
*  years on this incredible innovation, they sold $2 billion and put that in their pockets. Now, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1496.9199999999998s)]
*  those employees, if it was a for profit, obviously no problem with that. But they took [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1503.0s)]
*  the stated mission of giving this to all of humanity and then took three or four percent [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1508.6s)]
*  of that gain and put it in their pockets. That's where I think this whole thing is going to get [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1513.1599999999999s)]
*  really crazy. And this is where the IRS also interpreted Mozilla, which was just $100 million, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1517.0s)]
*  and none of the employees took any of it. The 100 million that came out of Mozilla, they were [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1525.7199999999998s)]
*  just saying, like, I think you should pay tax on that. Should you pay tax on that? And then [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1530.36s)]
*  they were investigated for years. So I think the IRS is going to be on this [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1534.6s)]
*  crazy based upon what happened to Mozilla, which was- [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1538.52s)]
*  Jason, do you think individual employee sellers are going to get audited by the IRS because of [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1541.2399999999998s)]
*  this? I don't, I mean, I'm no, we're in uncharted territory here. When I did some tweets and said, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1547.56s)]
*  hey, can everybody contact me who has information on these structures? I was able to find the [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1552.6799999999998s)]
*  Sama source example and they did it very clean and there was no IP transfer or employees enriching [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1557.56s)]
*  themselves or a god king like Sam doing all kinds of deals and enriching himself. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1565.48s)]
*  It was a very clean structure. And then Mitchell Baker, who set up Mozilla, also did the same [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1571.3999999999999s)]
*  thing. Hey, let's pay the employees an extra 50K on their salaries and they'll be a little overpaid [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1574.9199999999998s)]
*  in Silicon Valley, but they're not getting billions of dollars in equity, which again, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1579.56s)]
*  I have no problem with people getting billions of dollars in equity in a for-profit, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1583.8s)]
*  but this was supposed to benefit humanity. It was supposed to be open. If this was open source [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1587.96s)]
*  and they took the 2 billion, I would actually not have much of a problem with it because we could [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1593.1599999999999s)]
*  all be looking at that mission and then Saks and myself and Friedberg and anybody who wanted to use [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1597.0s)]
*  that code could go in there and adapt it. And you know what? There are for-profits, Apple [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1601.96s)]
*  and Metta, which are producing open source software. So if they're producing, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1607.72s)]
*  Apple's pretty competent and Metta is super competent in this respect. They're able to do [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1611.72s)]
*  open source, but Sam is claiming or OpenAI is claiming it's too dangerous to show us the open [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1616.68s)]
*  source code. I call bull on that. Their code is not too dangerous for us to sit. That's complete [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1621.96s)]
*  utter bull. So you think that there was a motivation for profit basically. What you're saying is [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1627.32s)]
*  essentially that this was highly motivated by profit versus like some of the emails, the emails [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1632.1200000000001s)]
*  try to paint a picture of very industrious people on both sides who are trying to solve a very hard [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1642.28s)]
*  problem and dealing with a conundrum that's really around capital, right? We need to do all this [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1648.76s)]
*  training. It's going to be so expensive. But I think what you're saying, which is a deviation [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1655.32s)]
*  from that, it's actually, come on guys, these are all very smart people and those folks on [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1659.96s)]
*  opportunity to make a ton of money and they took it. I mean, that seems like what happened here to [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1664.04s)]
*  me. I mean, it's Hawkins razor kind of situation. I think if you look at it, I think they probably [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1669.8s)]
*  regretted making this a nonprofit and then tried to figure out a way to reverse it. That's actually [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1675.24s)]
*  what I think is going on here. And I do think there was part of it, Chamath, you're right, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1679.6399999999999s)]
*  that they needed servers and they need a capacity, but they could have done that without giving the [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1682.76s)]
*  employees tons of equity, without selling billions of dollars, keeping it open source [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1688.2s)]
*  and then telling Microsoft, Hey, if you want access to this open source or whatever, and [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1692.76s)]
*  you know, you're making a very, very good point. And the reason is that if it was open source, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1697.88s)]
*  Microsoft could have just taken it and done its own training and just paid for it. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1706.36s)]
*  Yeah. Or make a donation to the foundation. This is interesting because open AI, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1711.08s)]
*  yeah, open AI dropped a few of the emails that they had with Elon. Obviously those are cherry [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1718.28s)]
*  picked to help their case the most. What we don't know is what are the other emails show? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1723.16s)]
*  Like what were their alternatives to this particular structure? Could they have raised [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1727.96s)]
*  the necessary funds in a way that was more consistent with the original mission of the [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1731.24s)]
*  company? Could they have remained open source? For example, also, are there any emails where [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1735.0800000000002s)]
*  employees talk about the potential benefit to them of going private, going for profit? Right? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1741.16s)]
*  Those emails have already been leaked. There was this thing where in the open AI emails that were [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1749.24s)]
*  leaked, they talked about being able to swap this phantom equity and open AI into either YC equity. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1754.68s)]
*  And then Elon said, Oh, maybe SpaceX too, but I'll have to figure that out. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1761.08s)]
*  Well, then also like Microsoft coming in and buying 49%. And then it's close. This is the other [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1764.44s)]
*  piece that I would want to see in discovery as well. And again, I don't have any problem with any [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1770.04s)]
*  of the people. I love Sam all I think is great. I think all the people there are great. I think [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1774.44s)]
*  what they've done for humanity is great. I just think they should have kept this thing open source, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1777.88s)]
*  which was the mission. But then they closed source at Chamath and then give 49% of it, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1781.5600000000002s)]
*  all the weights, all the source code to Microsoft. So that to me was like a really, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1787.8000000000002s)]
*  like you want to talk about taking this nonprofit's IP and then some amount of that bag gets given to [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1793.4s)]
*  the employees for billions of dollars. And then Microsoft gets 49% of all that nonprofits effort [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1800.5200000000002s)]
*  to then go commercialized. And Microsoft has added what $500 billion in market cap since this [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1805.24s)]
*  whole thing has been announced. So now all that profit has been aggregated into Microsoft stock. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1810.6s)]
*  And I think this is where you got to understand why Elon feels swindled is because not only are [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1816.84s)]
*  we going from nonprofit to for-profit and open source to closed source, he was specifically [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1822.36s)]
*  concerned about all of the benefits of AI crewing to one powerful big tech company. Now at that time, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1827.4s)]
*  he thought it was Google. Now it's Microsoft. There's not really that much of a difference. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1834.2s)]
*  He never wanted all the benefits of AI in the hands of one really powerful tech company. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1838.52s)]
*  And Microsoft is now the biggest company in the world by market cap. So this is like the [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1846.6000000000001s)]
*  opposite of what he intended. They gifted a trillion dollars to Microsoft, probably. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1851.0800000000002s)]
*  There's an easy solution. If they are people of good faith and they're doing this for the right [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1854.68s)]
*  reasons, open source it. Just go back and open source it. Jason, but to your earlier point, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1859.96s)]
*  that may solve the lawsuit and Elon may drop the lawsuit, but it's opened a can of worms [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1865.56s)]
*  with respect to tax and structuring that's much bigger than just open AI. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1870.68s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think it solves that. It's the entire nonprofit industry. It's a tax problem [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1874.68s)]
*  for every new company. It's every other entrepreneur that studies this model and tries to replicate it [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1877.96s)]
*  for their own personal gain, even if that wasn't intentional here. So there's a whole set of issues [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1883.08s)]
*  that we've really cracked the egg here. We've got to figure out how to unscramble it. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1889.24s)]
*  There's the IRS issues, then there's what's morally right, and then there's Elon's beef. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1894.76s)]
*  And if it is a for-profit company and Elon put in 50 million when it was a seed round, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1898.52s)]
*  what would he own, Sachs? What would his ownership in this for-profit be? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1902.6s)]
*  Oh my God. I mean, probably- 98%. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1907.48s)]
*  Okay. And so- Yeah, we need to know the total size of that round. He put in the first 40 million. Do [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1910.76s)]
*  we know what other people put in? It was most of the money, right? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1915.64s)]
*  Yeah, it was most of the money. So I mean, if you put, let's just put a crazy valuation on it, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1918.5200000000002s)]
*  500 million. Okay, he owns whatever, 10%. No, that's not really enough. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1922.76s)]
*  At that point, AI was not what it is today. Of course not. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1927.64s)]
*  You would have raised 150 on 50 pre. Okay. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1933.0s)]
*  That's the way that a very capex intensive deal in a space that wasn't thought to yield big outcomes, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1937.16s)]
*  that's unfortunate. Elon would own half the company, at least. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1942.84s)]
*  At least. So give him 20% of the company, it's $20 billion. That's even half of what you're [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1945.8s)]
*  saying, Sachs, right? We talked about on the show when that whole [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1950.4399999999998s)]
*  fracas with these nonprofit directors went down, is we said, go back and restructure the whole [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1953.56s)]
*  thing to make it what it always should have been, which is just a clean for-profit entity. Give Elon [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1960.4399999999998s)]
*  his equity, give Sam his equity, because it never made sense that Sam didn't have equity either. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1965.6399999999999s)]
*  Sam has no equity, but he's got a venture firm. It's all so convoluted. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1970.04s)]
*  It's a weird form of compensation in which they're giving him corporate opportunities [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1973.1599999999999s)]
*  in effect as a type of compensation, when really he should just have compensation in the corporation, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1979.6399999999999s)]
*  and then the corporation should own all of its opportunities. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1985.48s)]
*  Oh, that's a really interesting thing you just said. So basically, yeah, it's like, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1987.8799999999999s)]
*  he famously has no equity, but then he has this retained optionality to monetize the ecosystem. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1992.36s)]
*  So even though he's not monetizing the thing, he gets to monetize everything around. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=1998.44s)]
*  Yeah. And it seems like the board, or at least the new board's okay with that because he is [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2002.76s)]
*  being undercompensated with respect to the main thing. So then he gets the side things, but that's [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2007.4s)]
*  not really the way it should work either. You know, Bill Gates said to us famously when [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2012.3600000000001s)]
*  we were at, when I was at Facebook, the value of an ecosystem is when the economic value generated [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2016.04s)]
*  by the ecosystem exceeds that of the platform. Now, in this case, you'd actually rather have [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2022.04s)]
*  50 basis points of the ecosystem than 5% of open AI, if that's true, because if this thing could [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2028.28s)]
*  be so revolutionary, you're talking 10, 20, 30 trillion dollars. What a mess. Oh, yeah. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2033.0s)]
*  Sam should just be given like a huge option grant and open AI, but then open AI should own [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2040.44s)]
*  its own venture fund. Yeah. And the SEC is looking into all this stuff. You know, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2045.88s)]
*  they look into a lot of things in fairness, but they're looking into it. What a mess. And [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2051.4s)]
*  we'll keep track of it. The other thing that's crazy, I don't know if you guys know this, but [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2055.16s)]
*  Nick, just as we close here, the most insane part of open eyes LP investment agreement, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2060.2s)]
*  which is on their website, you can just search for open AI LP agreement is this part. The partnership [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2064.6s)]
*  exists to advance open AI inks mission of ensuring that safe artificial general intentions is [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2069.72s)]
*  deployed and benefits all of humanity. The general partners duty to this mission and principles [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2073.96s)]
*  advance in opening icing chart, yada, yada, yada, take precedent over the obligation to generate a [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2078.3599999999997s)]
*  profit. The partnership may never make a profit and the general partners under no obligation to [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2082.92s)]
*  do so. The general part is free to reinvest any and all of the operating entities cashflow into [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2086.6800000000003s)]
*  research and development activities and or related expenses without any obligation to the limited [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2091.88s)]
*  partners. And so they basically told everybody, the node and employees or whatever, we can just [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2096.2000000000003s)]
*  basically make wipe your equity out and we can do whatever we want with the profits and you're [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2102.36s)]
*  probably going to lose your money. So this structure is weird. Do you guys think that when the [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2106.28s)]
*  investors came in, especially in this latest round, the $86 billion round, do you think they [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2111.88s)]
*  underwrote the legal risk inherent in the structure? Or they just sort of hand waved over it and said, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2117.1600000000003s)]
*  No, typically what happens in these deals is you hire somebody like KPMG or Deloitte or Ernst and [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2124.52s)]
*  Young to do like the full financial diligence packet, right. And that typically tends to be [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2133.0s)]
*  how a lot of late stage organizations document that they've done and manage their fiduciary [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2138.52s)]
*  responsibilities on behalf of their limited partners. So what happens is you will do a deal, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2144.44s)]
*  you'll sign a term sheet, you'll turn it over to Deloitte, you'll turn it over to KPMG and say, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2149.08s)]
*  please go and run this down. And then what they do is they will furnish a report that says, yes, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2154.52s)]
*  this meets all the customary expectations. I suspect that if these folks were doing [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2159.24s)]
*  a decent job of running late stage money, they probably sent it to those folks. And those folks [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2165.4s)]
*  probably produce something that said this looks fine. Now, if you read Buffett's letter this year, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2172.2000000000003s)]
*  he has a really great commentary on Deloitte and KPMG and these sorts of letters, which is not [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2177.4s)]
*  exactly the most supportive is the best way to say it. Nick, you can find that mention. In his [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2185.4s)]
*  case, it's Deloitte and Touche. But typically, Sachs, that's what they do. They go to a KPMG [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2190.76s)]
*  or Deloitte or a Nerson Young and say, and by the way, 99% of the time, they're, I mean, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2194.44s)]
*  they do really good work, but it's a standard structure. And they just want to make sure that [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2201.16s)]
*  nothing nefarious is a muck. In this case, I doubt anything was a muck anyways. I doubt though that [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2207.32s)]
*  they looked at the structure and then also elevated the litigation risk of this getting unwound. I just [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2212.12s)]
*  don't see that that diligence report and I've seen enough of them typically has that, you know, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2218.2000000000003s)]
*  section in it. The other thing that's completely hypocritical here is they said it when they hit [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2225.2400000000002s)]
*  AGI and they're going to be like a sentient artificial intelligence going on here, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2230.36s)]
*  Friedberg, that they would wrap up shop and they're going to no longer be a nonprofit, et cetera. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2235.96s)]
*  But they haven't, but they're claiming they haven't hit that, but they close the software. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2241.6400000000003s)]
*  So it should be open source if they haven't hit AGI and you don't think they've hit [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2246.92s)]
*  general intelligence, right? Freeburg or anything close to it. Maybe you could educate the audience [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2252.84s)]
*  on what that is and that claim that they have to shut off the for-profit. Yeah, they haven't. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2257.8s)]
*  But I think the, we keep repeating this concept of the models should be open source versus closed [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2263.8s)]
*  source. Making AI for the benefit of humanity can be interpreted in a lot of ways. There may have [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2271.48s)]
*  been some anecdotal conversation at some point with Elon or others about we're going to make the [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2276.52s)]
*  models open source. But there was a reason that that change was made along the way, which was to [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2281.56s)]
*  attract dollars and those dollars need to have some return of capital available to them because [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2288.36s)]
*  they're private investor dollars. And so I don't think that that was necessarily, and correct me [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2296.12s)]
*  if I'm wrong, I don't think that's in the mission that the open AI software models will be open [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2301.24s)]
*  source. Making AI for the benefit of humanity could probably be interpreted in a lot of different [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2305.64s)]
*  ways and we'll see. But no, I don't think that anyone has this achieved this [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2310.6s)]
*  holy grail of general intelligence. Yeah. I think one of the more interesting and kind of wacky [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2319.48s)]
*  things about open AI is that their mission is explicitly to create EGI, which most people would [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2327.08s)]
*  associate with some sort of sci-fi dystopian outcome. And I think this has raised the fear [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2335.64s)]
*  factor around AI because they're explicitly trying to create the sentience that's going to [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2342.2799999999997s)]
*  replace humanity. Now, I think they define AGI in a different way. They say it's something that can [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2348.44s)]
*  replace 80% of the jobs, but I think we all kind of know what it really is. So I just wonder if- [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2353.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't know. I think that that assumes a steady state in the world. So if you end up with a system [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2360.12s)]
*  and the system has all the capabilities of a bunch of really highly qualified knowledge workers, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2368.92s)]
*  and I can sit in front of a computer terminal and I can say, let's design a mission to Mars. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2376.52s)]
*  A mission to Mars could be a 20-year engineering project with hundreds of people involved to design [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2381.72s)]
*  the buildings, to design the flight path, to figure out the fuel needs, to figure out how you [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2386.92s)]
*  would then be able to terraform Mars. And what if one person could interact with a computer [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2390.92s)]
*  and design a plan to go and inhabit Mars? All of the technical detail docs could be produced. All [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2395.64s)]
*  of the engineering specifications could be generated. All of the operating plans, all of [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2401.64s)]
*  the dates, the amount of labor needed, the amount of production needed, the amount of capital needed. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2405.8s)]
*  What would otherwise take NASA or some international or well-funded private company [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2410.12s)]
*  many, many decades to do, a piece of software could do in a very short order? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2415.56s)]
*  I think that's a really, for me, poignant example of the potential of having these tools [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2420.2s)]
*  broadly available, that the potential of humanity starts to become much broader. We could say, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2426.44s)]
*  I want to develop a city underneath the ocean because I want to explore more of the Earth. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2431.96s)]
*  I think humans need to go solve cancer, figure out the biologic drugs and the combination of [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2436.92s)]
*  biologic drugs that would be needed to solve cancer based on this patient's genotype. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2441.88s)]
*  The extensibility of highly knowledgeable or what other people might call general intelligence type [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2446.92s)]
*  tooling is extraordinary, that one individual starts to have an entire cohort of knowledge [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2452.44s)]
*  workers available at their disposal to do things that we can't even imagine today. So I don't think [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2459.7200000000003s)]
*  that it is nefarious. It's nefarious because we assume a steady state of the world today, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2465.2400000000002s)]
*  that nothing changes, therefore a piece of software replaces all of us. But the potential [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2468.52s)]
*  of humanity starts to stretch into a new era that we're not really comfortable with because [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2473.0s)]
*  we don't really know it or understand it yet. I'm not saying it's nefarious to want to develop AI [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2477.32s)]
*  because I agree with you about all the extraordinary potential of it. I'm saying there's something a [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2483.8s)]
*  little bit cultish and weird about explicitly devoting yourself to AGI, which I think in common [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2487.96s)]
*  parlance means Skynet. Yeah, it means something sentient, smart, and human. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2495.56s)]
*  Maybe that parlance is what needs to be addressed, which is AGI effectively enables equivalence to a [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2501.64s)]
*  human knowledge worker. And that can kind of unleash a new kind of set of opportunities. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2507.72s)]
*  So you think that's what it is. My definition for AGI is smarter than [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2513.4s)]
*  the smartest human being who ever lived. Yeah, I was talking to somebody this week [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2516.68s)]
*  who's in a position who said the definition of AGI is very fuzzy, that there isn't a clear [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2519.7999999999997s)]
*  definition and therefore it allows every side to kind of anchor on their interpretation of what [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2525.48s)]
*  that term means and therefore kind of justifies their position. So I don't really feel great [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2530.84s)]
*  about just saying, are we at AGI? We don't have a clear sense of what it means. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2535.88s)]
*  I do think if you look at some of the work that was done by Anthropic and published in the Cloud [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2540.04s)]
*  3 model this week, did any of you guys see the demos that were done of the output of that model? [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2544.6s)]
*  There was a guy who wrote a thesis in quantum physics on a very esoteric complicated problem set [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2548.92s)]
*  and he asked Cloud 3 to solve this problem set and it came up with his thesis. It was really [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2554.76s)]
*  extraordinary. And this is something he's like, no one in the world knows this stuff. And he's like, [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2560.28s)]
*  I can't believe this model came up with my thesis. And that's the sort of thing that very few people [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2563.6400000000003s)]
*  on earth even read or understand. And the Cloud 3 model was able to kind of recreate the basis, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2569.48s)]
*  the buildup, and then the output of his thesis was really extraordinary. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2575.32s)]
*  It'd be like somebody writing a screenplay and then giving it the first two acts and say, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2578.6000000000004s)]
*  guess the third act. And it's like, oh yeah, this is the third act. Here's what happens. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2581.96s)]
*  Like it's pretty impressive. Yeah. I asked you like deep down when these guys say they're going [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2585.48s)]
*  to create AGI, what do you think they really mean in their heart of hearts? Oh, they mean the [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2590.92s)]
*  terminated. Yeah. They mean the sentient. You guys are, you guys are propagating some bad s**t. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2596.68s)]
*  I think that's what they think. Remember what Larry Page said, Elon has said it. Remember what [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2603.4s)]
*  Larry Page said to Elon, don't be speciest. Yeah. I think there's like, I think there's a [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2607.08s)]
*  meaningful number of people in the tech community who deliberately want to give rise to the [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2612.92s)]
*  super intelligence. There's another point of view of super intelligence where super intelligence [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2618.84s)]
*  means that the software is now more intelligent than all humans. And as a result, the software [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2623.24s)]
*  may have its own motivations to figure out how to supersede humans on earth. Now the Larry Page [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2628.2s)]
*  statement, which I don't know firsthand, I read the same article you did, is one that a group of [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2635.16s)]
*  people might say evolution is evolution. You know, there are people there. That's right. And I know [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2640.44s)]
*  Elon's taken this point of view that like, you know, we need to maintain human supremacy, but- [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2647.8799999999997s)]
*  My favorite test is, you know, there was, there's the Turing test, which like you can't tell if it's [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2655.24s)]
*  a human or if it's a robot, but Mustafa came up with the modern Turing test, which is an AI [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2659.72s)]
*  model is given $100,000 and has to obtain 1 million. Go. Kind of interesting. And the other- [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2665.8799999999997s)]
*  That's a good idea. The other interesting one was Gary Marcus. He said the IKEA test, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2671.72s)]
*  the flat pack furniture test. An AI views the parts and instructions of an IKEA flat pack product [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2678.04s)]
*  that controls a robot to assemble the furniture correctly. Oh, look, what's up, Sonny? It's now [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2683.0s)]
*  time to do just a quick little congratulations to our dear friend, Sundeep Madhra. We call him [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2689.24s)]
*  Sonny. That's his nickname. And he's one of our poker buddies. He keeps building great companies. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2695.3199999999997s)]
*  And in this case, Sonny is the first person to collect all four besties. We all invested in his [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2700.8399999999997s)]
*  company, Definitive. And Definitive was working in AI, but we got some great news this week. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2705.3199999999997s)]
*  And we thought we would give him his flowers. Sonny, you want to tell us what happened this [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2712.6s)]
*  week with our investment in your company, Definitive Intelligence at definitive.io, [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2716.36s)]
*  I believe is your domain. Yeah. Well, you know, with your guys support and, you know, we've been [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2721.8s)]
*  growing our company and we saw a really great opportunity to work together with Grok and we've [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2726.6s)]
*  been working with them for a couple of months and all the hype that you've seen has been built on [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2731.1600000000003s)]
*  the collaborations that we've done building the cloud offering, the API offerings. And so, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2735.88s)]
*  you know, we've decided to merge with them and we're super excited and all the besties are now [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2741.4s)]
*  not only shareholders in definitive previously, but now shareholders in Grok. This is the first [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2746.2s)]
*  investment, I think, where we're all on the cap table, right? So we can all, we're all rooting [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2751.96s)]
*  in the same direction. What's happening in the developer side? How's the momentum? Well, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2755.48s)]
*  the momentum is incredible. You know, we have now 16,000 plus developers in our, you know, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2759.48s)]
*  self-serve playground. There's well over like a thousand apps that people have developed using [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2765.3199999999997s)]
*  the API and all kinds of new functionality. You know, the API allows people to get a higher rate [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2771.24s)]
*  of throughput on tokens and low latency. So there's all kinds of new applications from voice [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2777.08s)]
*  to real-time translation of web pages. You know, we're collecting them on our Discord. We have, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2781.64s)]
*  you know, 3000 people in the Discord as well. It is a real community that's come together building [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2787.0s)]
*  around Grok. And what I will say is, you know, sort of the same jump that developers saw when we [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2792.6s)]
*  went from dial-up internet to broadband, they're seeing that now and from using like traditional [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2797.08s)]
*  APIs for LLMs to using, you know, the ones that we offer. You guys support the latest and [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2801.64s)]
*  profit models that they just launched that seem pretty kick-ass? No, we don't have those yet, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2807.64s)]
*  but we're in this, you know, we're having discussions with everyone out there and we want [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2812.6s)]
*  to support their models. Right now, what we've done, given all the demand, is we've kind of [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2816.2799999999997s)]
*  limited it to Llama 270B and MixedTroll. And we actually have a bunch of other models that we make [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2820.36s)]
*  available in private mode for folks who are pretty excited. But if there's anyone out there [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2825.24s)]
*  that wants to have us, you know, give us a call and we'll get you going on our systems. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2829.24s)]
*  Well, Sonny, congrats to you. You're an incredible entrepreneur and it's always fun to kind of [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2833.7999999999997s)]
*  be on the journey with you. This is my fourth business that I've done with Sonny Madra. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2841.64s)]
*  That's amazing. ExtremeLabs. Then there was the company in between. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2847.0s)]
*  No, no, no. There was one before Extreme. You have to understand, Sonny and I met because Sonny [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2850.52s)]
*  went to school where I grew up. He went to the University of Ottawa. I grew up there [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2854.36s)]
*  and we met through a mutual friend and his first company was called SpongeFish, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2858.44s)]
*  which I backed, I think in 2006, maybe. I mean, I had no money. I may have written a $10,000 check. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2863.48s)]
*  Yeah, would you give him $8,000? $10K maybe. Maybe less. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2869.0s)]
*  $10K check? Maybe less, $5K. Yeah, I mean, whatever I had. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2871.96s)]
*  $5K. I didn't have much. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2874.6800000000003s)]
*  I like it. Scraped together. And it's our fourth business. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2875.8s)]
*  Sonny's a variable rabbit's foot. You're a rabbit's foot, Sonny. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2878.6s)]
*  He's a luck box. Luck prefers the prepared. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2883.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, I've been in two of Sandeep's companies and I thank him for that. And then [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2887.0s)]
*  ExtremeLabs actually to thank you again. You sponsored a lot of my events 10 years ago when [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2892.2000000000003s)]
*  I was coming up, so I appreciate that. So it's just great to see a nice guy win as opposed to the [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2897.4s)]
*  three miserable people who I work with on this podcast keep winning. So it's good. Now finally, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2902.1200000000003s)]
*  a good guy wins as opposed to the four of us. Well, I appreciate all your guys' support. It [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2906.76s)]
*  means a lot to us. You guys get in the developers and keep putting it out there and keep us honest [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2910.76s)]
*  as well. So if we're not doing something right, let us know. We really appreciate you guys all. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2916.92s)]
*  Sachs, you want to say something motivational to Sonny here? I know you always have a great [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2920.76s)]
*  motivational word for your friends, something you say that just gives people that thrill of [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2925.0800000000004s)]
*  being in the game. Go ahead, Sachs. You always have something kind to say. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2930.76s)]
*  We're going to ship $20 million into your safe note. I know you closed it, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2933.48s)]
*  but we're going to pry it open and get some allocation. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2937.16s)]
*  If there's a wedge, I know a guy with a podcast who's got 800,000 followers. Maybe I can slip [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2945.3199999999997s)]
*  in a quick $500. Is that possible? What do you think, Sundeep? Let us know right now. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2950.2s)]
*  I don't know. We did a really big announcement with the Saudis this week, so that price might [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2953.72s)]
*  be up. Let us ship something into that safe note so we actually have some real skin in the game. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2958.04s)]
*  David, text me. All right, we'll do. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2961.72s)]
*  No, but seriously, hey, Sundeep, wait a second. If he gets in, a guy got to get a second chip. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2963.88s)]
*  Let me text you. Jason wants it for $500. By that, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2968.04s)]
*  he means $500. No, I got a gift card for you from Starbucks. I got a $500 gift card for you and the [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2970.6s)]
*  team. I think I got like a hundred K on the briefs credits. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2976.52s)]
*  Jaykal's going to redeem that Starbucks gift card. He'll sell it for $0.20 on the dollar and [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2978.92s)]
*  then ship it into Croc. Let me zip it in. Maybe I can 100X it. No, seriously, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2983.56s)]
*  $500K from your boy, Jaykal. All right, everybody. Thanks to Sonny for jumping on. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2986.7599999999998s)]
*  Congratulations on the merger. Thanks, guys. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2991.8s)]
*  All right, issue two. Issue two. Apple is battling two major iOS developers and regulators [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2993.5600000000004s)]
*  are siding with the devs. You may know about the Apple versus Epic Games saga. We've talked about [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=2999.7200000000003s)]
*  it here. Epic Games is planning to create a custom app store on iOS because Europe's DMA, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3005.2400000000002s)]
*  the Digital Markets Act, has said that Apple now has to allow third-party app stores in the EU. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3012.6800000000003s)]
*  Epic created a developer account based in Sweden and Apple actually approved the account two weeks [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3019.48s)]
*  ago. Then on Wednesday, Apple flipped, terminated Epic's EU developer account. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3024.12s)]
*  Apple said one of the reasons they terminated the account was because Epic CEO publicly criticized [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3028.92s)]
*  their DMA compliance plan. Additionally, on Monday, Apple was fined $2 billion by the EU's [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3033.0s)]
*  antitrust regulators and was forced to remove its anti-steering rules from music apps like Spotify. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3039.24s)]
*  Basically, Apple has been restricting music apps from informing users about pricing and discounts. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3045.8s)]
*  The European Commission considered this anti-competitive since Apple runs Apple Music. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3050.84s)]
*  They want Spotify to pay 30%. Daniel Eck, a friend of the pod, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3056.52s)]
*  basically did a whole video on this about how they can't charge 30% more, yada, yada. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3061.88s)]
*  Sax, you've spoken about Apple's monopoly before. Your thoughts on what's happening in the EU [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3066.52s)]
*  and then we'll get into Apple's wider problems. Did you just say that Apple booted Epic from [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3073.0s)]
*  their app store because they didn't like what Epic said about them? They're violating Epic's free [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3080.84s)]
*  speech because they don't like what Epic is saying. According to Epic, yes. This is [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3089.0s)]
*  crazily heavy-handed by Apple. Apple heavy-handed with developers? Have they lost their minds? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3093.4s)]
*  This is right out of power corrupts and absolute power corrupts, absolutely. Whatever dispute you [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3099.64s)]
*  have with Epic, you don't boot them out of your app store because you don't like their criticism [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3105.16s)]
*  of you. This is basically proving exactly what everyone's been saying about Apple, which is [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3109.4s)]
*  they're too powerful and heavy-handed. Apple's coming along and saying, let me confirm it for [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3116.36s)]
*  you guys by acting tyrannically against Epic. Talk about a backfire. This seems insane to me. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3120.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's super nuts. Chamath, any thoughts on this before we get into Apple's other problems? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3128.2s)]
*  I think it's the beginning of the decay of Apple. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3133.88s)]
*  Peak Apple. Well, let's get into that. There's tons of headwinds facing Apple. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3138.92s)]
*  You can add a bunch of other things to the list as well, Jason. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3142.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3145.4s)]
*  The thing is Apple for the last couple of years has been what is effectively what we call a GDP plus [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3146.44s)]
*  growth company, which means that take GDP, two, three, four percent. Maybe they can grow by a [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3152.12s)]
*  couple of percentage points more than that, but they are effectively levered to GDP, meaning when [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3157.4s)]
*  you look at a Facebook or an Nvidia, they're growing at 50%, 200%, 2000%, whatever it is. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3163.0s)]
*  That's not tied to GDP. They're just taking share. But Apple is a company now that grows as the [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3169.48s)]
*  economy of the world grows. So that's not super great for its future prospects unless it can [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3175.4s)]
*  expand the surface area of where they operate. Then on that dimension, there are a few trillion [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3180.36s)]
*  dollar markets that they can really penetrate. They just announced that they've killed a project [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3187.1600000000003s)]
*  in one of those areas, which is autos, Project Titan, which was $10 billion, turned out to be [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3191.88s)]
*  a failure. All of these things, I think, mean to me that it is effectively becoming a cyclical, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3196.84s)]
*  rate sensitive stock. And then the coup de grace Warren Buffett. And Nick and I were talking about [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3204.2000000000003s)]
*  it this week. And what was interesting about Buffett's letter is that you can tell when [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3211.7200000000003s)]
*  Buffett has gotten disengaged with a company based on the number of times he mentions it [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3219.0s)]
*  in his annual letter. So in this example, this is the number of times Apple was mentioned. And [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3225.0s)]
*  just to be clear, what I mean by mentions is not what it's included in the chart or part of a [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3230.84s)]
*  disclosure. What I mean is, when Warren actually explicitly mentions it in a positive or even [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3234.36s)]
*  negative way, or he doesn't mention it at all, which I think rings very loudly, he went from [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3239.8s)]
*  basically saying, Apple was the absolute end all and be all. And now what you can start to see is [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3245.6400000000003s)]
*  this shrinking. And it's gone from basically a bunch of times to almost none. He did mention [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3253.56s)]
*  it once, but he mentioned it in the context of talking positively about Coca Cola and HEMEX. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3258.52s)]
*  And he was lauding these two positions, but just mentioning that they were not as large in [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3263.48s)]
*  comparison to Apple. That's the only mention in this year's annual letter. What's interesting [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3268.92s)]
*  about that is the last time that that happened was with drumroll, Wells Fargo. Over 15 and 20 years, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3273.96s)]
*  Buffett built up a huge position. I think he was able to weather the vicissitudes of the market. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3280.7599999999998s)]
*  So even when the markets would contract, he knew when to hold on to that company, until he realized [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3287.88s)]
*  that that company was not really one of his forever stocks. And he got out of it. And the number of [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3293.1600000000003s)]
*  times it basically was mentioned in his letter went to zero. So interestingly, I think this Buffett [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3299.32s)]
*  index is a really important one for Apple, which is it went from a forever holding that he said he [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3306.2000000000003s)]
*  would own forever to barely getting mentioned. And above him, above Apple on that list were all the [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3312.36s)]
*  Japanese trading companies that Buffett owns, American Express, Coca Cola. So that is a person [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3318.6800000000003s)]
*  that understands the economy, I think, better than anybody else in the world. And so if you're [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3326.04s)]
*  basically taking a levered bet to the economy as a reason to own Apple, and the person that [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3331.0s)]
*  understands the economy the most has now started to pivot away, he started to sell in quarter four. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3335.2400000000002s)]
*  And then you see all of these things, entry trust rules, killing projects in trillion dollar TAMs. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3341.4s)]
*  Unfortunately, it speaks for a very bad next five to 10 years for this company unless they figure [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3347.32s)]
*  something out. I think it's just such a great insight with the Warren Buffett mentions. And we [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3352.6000000000004s)]
*  should do that forward looking like, who is he talking about now? And let's the monitor when he [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3357.2400000000002s)]
*  stops talking about them. I have a theory about this. I think this is really just about peak iPhone. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3361.4s)]
*  If you look at the majority of their revenue, it's obviously from the iPhone, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3366.84s)]
*  which has become massively profitable over time. But the iPhone revenue has been flat for a couple [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3370.76s)]
*  of years now. And they're starting to make their money from services. Everybody knows Apple One, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3376.28s)]
*  iCloud storage, Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple Plus TV. They've got a great collection of services [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3381.48s)]
*  and services revenue is growing. But I don't think that they are filling in this growth problem with [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3387.96s)]
*  the iPhone. And this happened to me for the first time. And I don't know if you gentlemen have had [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3393.88s)]
*  the same experience, but I was buying every Apple phone. And then I would buy every like [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3397.88s)]
*  medium upgrade, like when they would do like a 12 and then a 12 S or an 11, 11 S. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3403.0s)]
*  And when I got to iPhone 13, I was like, this thing's kind of peaked. And I just forgot to [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3408.28s)]
*  buy the 14, didn't need it. And then I bought the 15 and I'm sitting here on my 15 and my 13. I [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3412.44s)]
*  really couldn't tell the difference between them. And so now I'm a technologist who would buy it [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3417.0s)]
*  every year, the latest one, and I don't feel the need to upgrade it. And I think that a lot of [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3421.0s)]
*  people and I have family members who would take two generations off. Now they take three or four [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3425.96s)]
*  generations off. So I don't even know what number I'm on. You know, I don't even know either. It all [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3430.84s)]
*  looks the same to me. Okay. So I mean, that's the problem here. And then if you look at their roadmap, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3435.32s)]
*  what's what is the device post the Steve Jobs era that they have launched? How do you know what [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3441.72s)]
*  device you have? You go to general and your settings and about I just checked it. I'm [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3447.4s)]
*  from 13 pro. What version of the general they're on 15 and I'm on 13 pro. I don't even know. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3452.12s)]
*  Yeah. And you're not price sensitive. And these things have gotten absurdly expensive. So they're [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3458.44s)]
*  trying to really extract what is the what is the latest 15 15 I'm on a 14. I don't like the hassle [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3463.56s)]
*  of having to like reset everything when I get a new phone. And it's easy to do now. It's like all [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3470.04s)]
*  in the cloud. But even that going to the store buying it like who cares? It's not my apps. I [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3475.48s)]
*  have to re log in and free Burke, what a but what Android phone are you on? Are you you're a Googler? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3480.28s)]
*  Didn't the Googlers all have Android phones? Where are you and your team iPhone? [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3486.12s)]
*  I got the Macintosh original in 1984. I've only been on Macintosh and Apple products since then. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3491.0s)]
*  What iPhone are you on? Be honest. 15 pro. Okay. Have you ever tried a pixel fee, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3498.68s)]
*  bro? I don't like it. But I just I'm not used to the OS. I just what was the rule at Google? If [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3504.28s)]
*  you worked at Google? Did were you kind of forced to have an Android phone or just keep your iPhone [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3511.6400000000003s)]
*  in your pocket and not take out? There weren't a lot of androids on the market when I was at Google, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3516.52s)]
*  because we acquired the company when I was there. And oh, we acquired Andy Rubin's company in oh, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3522.2000000000003s)]
*  four. And I think the first major devices started to roll out in oh seven. And so this was all post [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3529.0s)]
*  my era I left at the end of oh six. Wow, free bird. That's an amazing chart. Holy [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3537.5600000000004s)]
*  So pull up this chart. Now, here's the global here's the global statistics. The US market share is 57% [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3542.84s)]
*  for iOS. But on a global basis, iOS only has a 27% market share in mobile operating systems. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3549.2400000000002s)]
*  Android is 72%. And all other is less than 1%. But look at this. It's all the future GDP is on [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3558.12s)]
*  Android. Brazil, Nigeria, India. Holy, but I think this is one counter to your point, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3564.68s)]
*  Shamath, that the macro driver is as the economic position, the GDP per capita scales [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3571.96s)]
*  in these BRICS nations, they can start to afford to buy iPhones, which are generally some multiple [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3579.0s)]
*  of the Android devices in these markets that you see here. So while today, Android is 72% of the [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3586.12s)]
*  market, if the emerging markets continue to grow GDP per capita, and iOS continues to be the superior [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3591.4s)]
*  product, you'll see Apple able to steal into more share over time. How do you but how do you do that [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3597.08s)]
*  when you have messaging groups on Android when you have photos in Google Photos? Is it does the [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3603.16s)]
*  switching cost stop that? Do you think I don't know the answer to that? It's a good question. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3609.24s)]
*  They're down to $15 to $25 for these Android phones in India. There's a famous... [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3613.64s)]
*  That's the difference. Yeah. Right. So these Android devices. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3618.76s)]
*  I think Apple is levered to GDP, global GDP. So they need to figure out some way to grow superior [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3621.8s)]
*  to that. So what is the market? What could they do? Services? [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3627.32s)]
*  A company that generally has a bunch of cashflow being generated by some set of products today, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3631.64s)]
*  and you assume stasis over time, the market share for those products could be eaten away, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3639.24s)]
*  you'll see the profits per year go down. And a company like that will trade anywhere from [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3644.2s)]
*  seven to 20 times. The technology value arises from the value of the brand that you can launch [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3648.68s)]
*  new products, leverage your brand, leverage your distribution, leverage the sale of new services, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3653.72s)]
*  and new products. I think to your point, Shumov, the challenge Apple is facing is that the pool of [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3658.92s)]
*  options, the portfolio of call options that you would get a new product coming out of Apple is [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3664.92s)]
*  shrinking. Very limited. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3670.04s)]
*  With the car being taken out of that pool now, Apple Vision Pro, a lot of question marks on how [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3671.16s)]
*  much it can scale. As you guys know, I feel like there's going to be a market for that device, but [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3677.88s)]
*  it's a high-end device today. It has to become more cheap to be more ubiquitous. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3683.0s)]
*  The thing that a lot of these companies confront though is that you can also grow inorganically. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3686.92s)]
*  You don't necessarily have to incubate these projects. We can remember the moment [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3691.64s)]
*  Apple had a chance to buy Tesla. Then they didn't take it. Apple still has a chance to buy, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3696.44s)]
*  pick your company that would take a sweet acquisition off, or Rivian, Lucid, Polestar, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3704.28s)]
*  whatever it is. I'm not saying that these companies are good or not good. I'm just saying that [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3710.84s)]
*  Apple has the one tool that they've never used in their toolbox is the large inorganic acquisition. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3714.6s)]
*  At this point, if they are proving that they can't execute internally, the market is going [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3721.48s)]
*  to demand that they prove they can use that balance sheet as a cudgel to go and execute it [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3727.2400000000002s)]
*  externally. If they don't do that, they're going to discount that cash to zero. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3731.56s)]
*  The challenge is that there's a certain discipline and quality to the products and the businesses [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3736.44s)]
*  that Apple produces and runs. It's very hard to see that in other markets. Why would they go buy [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3743.32s)]
*  a money-losing, low-margin car hardware company when they are proven to make high quality ... [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3749.32s)]
*  It depends on the reasons Project Titan failed. The article in Bloomberg basically said that the [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3755.56s)]
*  reason that they abandoned the project was in part that they did not know how to go from where they [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3763.2400000000002s)]
*  were to a full production vehicle that could be level five. Then when it was proposed that they [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3769.88s)]
*  step down and just launch a level three autonomous vehicle, everybody said no, that it wasn't [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3775.56s)]
*  disruptive enough. Well, if that's the case, the thing that they made a decision about there [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3780.04s)]
*  was not going into a market because of regulation, not because of technical capability. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3785.4s)]
*  I don't think that that's necessarily a smart decision. They would have been better off [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3790.52s)]
*  going into the car market, launching a level three vehicle, and just letting the market play out. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3794.7599999999998s)]
*  They probably, just like they were able to do music, have the influence to change the laws, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3798.52s)]
*  especially if they stepped in there with their rigor. They're not doing that. It's a little bit [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3804.2000000000003s)]
*  of a head scratch of what's going on over there. They need some new products. Maybe Apple Vision [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3809.1600000000003s)]
*  Pro someday becomes the platform of the future, but they've squeezed as much revenue as they can [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3813.32s)]
*  out of the iPhone. Services seems like the best place for them to make money, but as we see, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3818.36s)]
*  the app store is under assault. My idea was just that. They should launch a huge competitor to AWS, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3823.0s)]
*  Azure, and GCP. Every developer that Apple has, theoretically, could have been running [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3829.56s)]
*  on an Apple, not just on Apple's SDK and APIs, but they should be running in an Apple Cloud. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3836.04s)]
*  You could have made that claim, and it would have made a ton of sense for app developers to have [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3840.7599999999998s)]
*  turnkey access to that. They could have subsidized it. By the way, to Sachs's point, that would have [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3844.92s)]
*  been an incredible way to defend a 30% rev share. Okay, listen, I'm taking 30%, but here's a bunch [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3850.44s)]
*  of subsidized access to hardware, and the market would have loved it. In this AI shift, they can [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3855.64s)]
*  still do that, where now people are chipping away at the 30%. People are saying, well, I can just [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3861.24s)]
*  build around you. They need to do something. In services, Jason, the most valuable thing they [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3867.16s)]
*  could do would be to launch a big cloud, I think. Yeah, I mean, they have all the app developers on [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3874.04s)]
*  TestFlight ready to go. They just email them and say, hey, here's your free storage. They can just [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3878.7599999999998s)]
*  slowly add features, and they're doing this open source, I think it's called Maggi or MagPi or [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3882.92s)]
*  something, but they're doing an image one. Well, look, if they could just make Siri work [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3890.44s)]
*  the way it was supposed to using an LLM and have it be snappy, that'd be a major upgrade [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3896.6s)]
*  to the iPhone. I don't think you need to buy a new iPhone for that because it would just be [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3903.64s)]
*  a software upgrade, but just getting Siri to work would be a big win. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3906.28s)]
*  I think that's where they're going with their silicon. They just announced the M3 on the [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3912.04s)]
*  MacBook Airs. They're making their own silicon, and I think it's going to power LLMs locally on [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3915.88s)]
*  the devices, and that's so powerful. I was using iPhoto this week, and in Apple Photos, there's [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3920.76s)]
*  now on certain images, if you swipe through them, you'll see the little AI icon. When you click it, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3928.04s)]
*  it tells you things in the photo. That's a bulldog. That's pasta. They're already subtly [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3933.56s)]
*  adding these features. Now, that's a feature Google's had in Google Photos for five years, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3939.64s)]
*  but go ahead and open your phone right now and search for a dog or bulldog or whatever type of [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3944.52s)]
*  dog you got, Labrador, and then watch Golden Retriever that it actually knows how to do it. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3948.7599999999998s)]
*  They never announced it. It's just subtly being put in there. There are so many opportunities. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3954.2799999999997s)]
*  If they required a hardware upgrade to get actually good AI built into the software, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3959.16s)]
*  then everyone's going to have to upgrade for that. That's a pretty big motivation to [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3965.16s)]
*  upgrade. They have it, Tim Cook. Somebody send this clip to Tim Cook. Put AI chips on your [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3969.64s)]
*  phone. This isn't hard, right? All they've got to do is just take the latest open source models and [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3974.92s)]
*  figure out how to customize them for their own products. Yeah, they're doing it. They're [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3980.68s)]
*  doing it right now. All right. Let's go to issue four, TikTok bipartisan ban. Will the CCP agree? [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3984.12s)]
*  A bipartisan group of a dozen plus lawmakers introduced a bill that would effectively ban [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3990.8399999999997s)]
*  TikTok. In the House this week, the bill is officially called the Protecting Americans [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=3995.88s)]
*  from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. It gives ByteDance 165 days to divest from [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4000.12s)]
*  TikTok. That's the parent company, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, the app that's very [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4005.96s)]
*  popular in the West, especially here in America. It would make it illegal for companies like Apple [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4010.6s)]
*  and Google to show TikTok in their app stores. As you know, TikTok, 170 million US users, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4015.2400000000002s)]
*  and they claim that their headquarters headquartered in Singapore. I know people [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4021.88s)]
*  who have worked at TikTok or do work at TikTok, and they said, that's nonsense to me. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4025.56s)]
*  The company said it has not and will not share user data with the CCP. In my mind, it's an obvious [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4031.08s)]
*  lie. In 2021, the CCP took a board seat on ByteDance Beijing-based subsidiary. That's according [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4037.32s)]
*  to Reuters. And then in 2022, ByteDance admitted that it accessed IP addresses and data by journalists [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4042.6s)]
*  covering TikTok to see if they'd been in the same places as ByteDance employees, obviously to find [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4048.6s)]
*  leakers. And ByteDance claims they fired the people involved, yada, yada. Last year, a former [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4052.68s)]
*  head of engineering at ByteDance US said CCP members had god mode access to user data in 2018. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4057.64s)]
*  Sax, I can go explain more of this, but I just got to go to you here. If ByteDance is not spying [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4063.3999999999996s)]
*  on Americans and the CCP is on the board, that would make no logical sense to me. And why are [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4071.48s)]
*  they fighting the divestiture if it's just the financial reason? Why would they take the CCP off [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4077.64s)]
*  their board? Do you think it's spyware? Do you think the US is crazy for allowing this product [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4082.2799999999997s)]
*  here in the United States when we're not allowed to put Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, pick your [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4086.52s)]
*  social network in China? We have zero reciprocity here. Look, if it's true that TikTok is sharing [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4091.72s)]
*  data with the CCP, then I think the United States is well within its rights to either ban it or [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4100.68s)]
*  cause it to be divested. And I personally like the divestiture option. I mean, that's what Trump was [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4106.6s)]
*  suggesting during his term. Because we don't, I think, in the United States like to just [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4111.4s)]
*  essentially confiscate or destroy people's property. But I think we're within our rights to [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4117.72s)]
*  require it to be divested to an entity that we know is completely separate from and won't cooperate [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4122.6s)]
*  with the CCP. This bill is better than the last bill we talked about that was targeted at TikTok. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4129.0s)]
*  I don't know if you remember that one, but it was weirdly prohibiting Americans from using VPNs and [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4137.08s)]
*  gave the government the right to go after Americans who are using VPNs. So this one seems cleaner and [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4143.48s)]
*  better and more narrowly targeted at divestiture. Now, at the beginning of my response to you, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4148.92s)]
*  I did say if. I know that everyone's just assuming that it's true that TikTok is sharing [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4155.32s)]
*  data with the CCP. But I just want to confirm that that is the case, because they are denying it. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4163.4s)]
*  And I can understand why people think it and why it might even be likely. But since we do have a [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4169.16s)]
*  concept of due process in America, I do think some evidence should be provided that that actually [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4174.759999999999s)]
*  is taking place. Well, we've had, you know, whistleblowers inside there. But Chamath, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4180.6s)]
*  if the CCP is spying on their own citizens, what are the chances that they wouldn't take the [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4185.72s)]
*  opportunity to spy on government officials who have TikTok on their phone or their kids and get [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4190.04s)]
*  compromised on them possibly or no locations of people? What does your gut tell you? Is the CCP, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4196.52s)]
*  is this too dangerous for us to have here in America under CCP control or this kind of influence [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4202.360000000001s)]
*  being on their board? I think you're asking the exact right question. I have two comments to make. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4207.88s)]
*  One is, Nick, if you can bring up this article about the Google AI IP case. Basically, what [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4215.32s)]
*  happened was that the DOJ filed an indictment. Actually, I think I sent you guys the actual [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4223.32s)]
*  indictment. But essentially, what happened is there was an engineer at Google. Yeah, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4232.6s)]
*  this is crazy. That has been charged with stealing AI secrets for China. And I don't know if whether [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4237.96s)]
*  he's back in China now or not. But the whole point is that if it's happened at Google, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4244.52s)]
*  right, where there's a motivation for the Chinese intelligence apparatus, and frankly, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4250.4400000000005s)]
*  every intelligence apparatus to infiltrate that organization and get access to all kinds of data, [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4255.4800000000005s)]
*  I think we should presume by default that all of these organizations are infiltrated. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4263.08s)]
*  And I think that that's probably a more conservative and reasonable posture. So [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4269.0s)]
*  Facebook is infiltrated, Google is infiltrated, Apple is infiltrated, TikTok is infiltrated. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4273.160000000001s)]
*  So on that dimension, I think that it should be considered 100% certainty that this data is [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4278.84s)]
*  getting back to not just the Chinese but multiple state-sponsored actors. So the question about [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4286.04s)]
*  TikTok then, I think should be one of business. And I think Palmer Luckey did a very good job of [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4293.240000000001s)]
*  simplifying this down to its essence, which is essentially what he called the law of equivalent [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4298.92s)]
*  exchange. If you want to just play this, it's like just a few seconds. I was kind of frustrated that [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4303.56s)]
*  people made TikTok into a cultural issue. By the way, I'm totally on the culture war side of it. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4307.0s)]
*  But I was saying, practically speaking, you should not make this a culture war issue. Don't talk about [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4314.04s)]
*  how it's ruining our youth's ideals. Just say strictly on a trade basis. We cannot allow them [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4319.0s)]
*  to sell this thing to us if we can't sell the same thing to them. That should be totally fair. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4325.56s)]
*  Tanner Iskra That's reciprocity. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4331.48s)]
*  Jason Kemp That's reciprocity. Me and Palmer Luckey in sync. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4332.6s)]
*  Paul Jay Right. So this is what he calls the law of equivalent exchange. And I think it just makes a [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4335.48s)]
*  lot of sense. So on the face, what I would say is, Jake, out my response is, I think that the CCP, [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4339.08s)]
*  but also other intelligence organizations have infiltrated all of these big companies, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4344.44s)]
*  and all of our data is accessible by them. I'm not going to say on a whim, but I think it's [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4349.48s)]
*  accessible. I think you have to deal with TikTok as a business issue. And I agree with Palmer Luckey, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4355.639999999999s)]
*  which is, they should not be able to sell to us what we cannot sell to them. And I think that [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4360.839999999999s)]
*  that's a fair principle that we can live on. Tanner Iskra Reciprocity is a very simple position. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4365.0s)]
*  Friedberg, let me use your creativity, your love of cinema. If you were to use this tool, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4369.88s)]
*  let's take the most cynical approach here, or interpretation. CCP has complete access [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4377.24s)]
*  to the algorithms, and they want to do maximum damage. Let's say during the election, let's say [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4382.360000000001s)]
*  in a conflict like the one going on in Ukraine with Russia, or in Gaza. What could they do [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4387.72s)]
*  using the algorithm, using videos? What would be the doomsday scenario for America? [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4397.24s)]
*  As in the CCP comes in and influences the management of this company and tells them [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4402.52s)]
*  what to tweak and how and why? Yes. What would they do? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4407.16s)]
*  I think we saw this during, after October 7th, that there was a significant surge in [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4411.08s)]
*  in pro-Hamas videos relative to Israel support videos. That's the sort of thing where you could [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4420.28s)]
*  kind of see something that sets an opinion that may be disruptive to the social fabric, [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4427.72s)]
*  to the election cycle that starts to get shared more frequently and shows up in feeds more [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4435.4s)]
*  frequently. Unlike Facebook and other places where there's a linear feed where you can scroll up and [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4440.2s)]
*  select what you want to watch, as you know, TikTok has already lined the videos up. So when you [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4445.0s)]
*  scroll up, they automatically play the next thing for you. So the ranking really matters in terms [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4449.4s)]
*  of viewership on TikTok, unlike a lot of other kind of select to play social media type networks. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4455.24s)]
*  Could it shift in election? Hearts and minds in a war? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4461.4s)]
*  Well, I've always said this. I think it's the craziest thing in the world [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4465.719999999999s)]
*  that someone can spend advertising dollars and change someone's vote. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4469.719999999999s)]
*  Just think about that fact for a second. I've said this before and people have told me I'm [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4474.759999999999s)]
*  an idiot for saying it. Meaning that you can or that it does? [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4478.52s)]
*  That both. But think about it. People don't individually go and gather data and then make [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4482.6s)]
*  an informed opinion about who they're going to vote for. Their opinion changes based on seeing [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4490.360000000001s)]
*  an ad. It is so crazy to me that that's the truth. I think the country knew that it does. That's why [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4494.84s)]
*  they prevented it from happening until they decided. Yeah, exactly. But I think that's what's [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4500.52s)]
*  so nuts is that there's no longer a forced discourse that kind of makes people go out and [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4506.04s)]
*  choose what content they want to consume, what they want to hear, debate stages, etc. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4514.04s)]
*  That now it's about who spends the most money to get the most views in front of someone. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4518.5199999999995s)]
*  And that that actually influences someone's decision on who to vote for is what's so compelling to me [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4522.2s)]
*  about why all of these systems have such extraordinary power. It's just so amazing to [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4527.72s)]
*  me that the more frequently someone sees an ad, the more likely they are to buy something or do [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4532.2s)]
*  something. Here's the bottom line. This thing is incredible. Someone a mimetic on TikTok, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4535.96s)]
*  the more likely they are to vote something differently. This thing is far too powerful [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4541.96s)]
*  for the CCP to have any kind of access to it for the Chinese government to have any kind of access [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4545.96s)]
*  to it. It has to be divested. If you look at what we went through in the last couple of election [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4550.36s)]
*  cycles, not being partisan in here at all. But we've said it, we've talked about Hunter Biden's [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4555.0s)]
*  laptop as but one example. You know, that was suppressed, obviously, on social networks. That [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4560.2s)]
*  could have been amplified in social networks and it could have had the opposite effect. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4565.24s)]
*  Hillary Clinton's emails, you know, Trump this, Hillary this, Biden that you could really sway [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4569.08s)]
*  an election by putting in specific, subtle information, let alone taking a hack and releasing [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4575.639999999999s)]
*  it like they did with Hillary Clinton's emails. So, you know, those things might not have swayed [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4583.4s)]
*  an election. But if Putin had access to this, like somebody who's super capable and he had access to [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4587.24s)]
*  always where it goes, is secretly pulling the strings of our elections. This is like the biggest [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4593.16s)]
*  threat inflation ever. Okay, look, if you ask people out there, do you think other people's votes [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4601.08s)]
*  are influenced by social media? They'll say, yeah, of course, people are brainwashed. If you say to [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4609.0s)]
*  them, is your own vote influenced by social media? Do you make up your own mind based on all the [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4612.52s)]
*  information you have? They'll say, yeah, of course, I'm not brainwashed. Everybody else is. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4618.76s)]
*  And I believe that people are closer to telling the truth when they're talking about themselves [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4622.76s)]
*  because they understand their own situation better than they understand everyone else's situation. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4627.88s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that all of us are constantly bombarded with information 24 hours [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4632.6s)]
*  a day, seven days a week through all of the channels, both online and offline, where we get [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4638.6s)]
*  information. Some of those data points come from advertisements, but I don't think we take ads very [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4642.76s)]
*  seriously. We're trained to even just block out the ads. When I see banner ads or even ads in my [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4648.68s)]
*  stream, I just scroll past them. They don't even factor in my consciousness. I am influenced [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4654.92s)]
*  by accounts that I follow, but there are accounts that I've chosen to follow because I think they [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4663.240000000001s)]
*  have signal over noise. And the more noisy those accounts are, the more I disregard them and take [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4667.4800000000005s)]
*  them less seriously with advertisements being the most noisy and least useful channels. So look, [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4672.92s)]
*  I think at the end of the day, this idea that we're all being brainwashed and secretly influenced [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4678.68s)]
*  by maligned foreign actors, I think is at a minimum threat inflation. And that entire narrative might [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4683.0s)]
*  just be completely bogus. Nonetheless, I do agree that for data collection reasons and reciprocity [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4689.16s)]
*  reasons, I think it's like I said, we're within our rights to require the divestment of TikTok. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4698.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't, you know, it's actually- [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4705.16s)]
*  Don't make this into more than it is. Again, I think this whole disinformation narrative, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4707.0s)]
*  by the way, you want to know why they push it so hard? It's because our own intelligence community [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4711.48s)]
*  wants to be involved. And there are political actors in the US who want to regulate, quote, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4717.639999999999s)]
*  disinformation on our own social networks. And I'm not talking about TikTok. I'm talking about [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4724.28s)]
*  X. I'm talking about Facebook, Insta, and so on. And we saw this in the Twitter files. We saw what [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4728.679999999999s)]
*  a cozy relationship the intelligence community had with Twitter. They were all up in there trying [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4733.96s)]
*  to control what legacy Twitter was allowing and what they were censoring. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4739.639999999999s)]
*  They blocked the New York Post URL. They blocked the New York Post URL. And you've said on this [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4745.48s)]
*  program that you believe that could have swung the election. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4748.36s)]
*  Well, I think it was, I think that actually was genuine election interference. I actually said I [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4750.92s)]
*  didn't know whether it could swing the election. I think that- [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4755.96s)]
*  What do you think it could have? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4758.68s)]
*  I think it was a story that deserved to be published and distributed online so that the [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4761.24s)]
*  public could take that into account when they voted. I mean- [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4767.56s)]
*  And so if it had been widely received, do you think, I'm asking a question. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4770.4400000000005s)]
*  How would I know? [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4773.96s)]
*  Okay. You're asking me a question that I personally think is irrelevant. How would I know [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4776.52s)]
*  whether the suppression of that story swung the election? How could I know that? The point is [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4780.84s)]
*  that the American people were deprived of information that they- [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4787.32s)]
*  Most Republicans believe that if that had come out, it would have swung the election. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4792.2s)]
*  I can't prove that it swung the election. What I'm saying is that it was a type of [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4796.68s)]
*  election interference. Why was that story suppressed? Because 51 former intelligence [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4801.64s)]
*  officials who still maintain close relations with the intelligence community [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4806.12s)]
*  published a bogus letter saying that it was Russian disinformation, which it wasn't, [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4809.64s)]
*  and then that caused our social media sites to suppress it. That to me is as concerning, [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4814.04s)]
*  if not more concerning, than whatever it is that TikTok's accused of. I don't want social media [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4821.320000000001s)]
*  companies being used by the intelligence communities of either China or the United States to swing [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4828.12s)]
*  or to influence our elections. We need to be equally concerned about that as we are about [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4834.68s)]
*  supposed Chinese influence. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4841.4800000000005s)]
*  Just to go back in time, you probably remember the Willie Horton ad. That kind of sunk to caucus, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4842.84s)]
*  if you remember that. Media and these ads can really have a big impact. People should just [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4847.0s)]
*  look historically. There have been many moments where, whether it's Nixon sweating on TV or the [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4851.8s)]
*  Willie Horton ad, there have been many moments where video can do this. I think they could be [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4856.52s)]
*  done even more subtly by the Chinese by just promoting certain videos. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4861.4s)]
*  All right, let's move on to Bitcoin. Issue five, Bitcoin's back, baby. It hits an all-time high. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4866.759999999999s)]
*  69,000. Interesting number on Tuesday. 69,000 before dropping, sitting around 68K. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4872.2s)]
*  As we're taping, it'll be 75 by the time you hear this, or 50. It's been ripping in 2024 up 70% [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4879.4s)]
*  since January 25th. There's two things going on here that you've probably heard about. The Bitcoin [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4887.32s)]
*  ETFs finally arrived in the US. They were approved by the SEC on January 10th. We'll get into them [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4894.36s)]
*  in a minute, Shumov. Obviously, if it's an ETF, super easy to buy them and sell them. They've been [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4899.48s)]
*  a total hit. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF became the fastest ETF to ever reach 10 billion in assets. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4905.08s)]
*  Also, as the technical crypto heads in the audience know, there is a halving happening in [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4911.4s)]
*  April. This happens about every four years at the current pace. Last one was May of 2020. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4917.48s)]
*  When these halfings happen, the mining rewards are cut in half. This reduces the supply of new [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4922.28s)]
*  Bitcoins entering circulation and can cause some swings. Shumatha, we released a clip, I think, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4928.28s)]
*  just about your prediction. You nailed it. Again, you said this would be a big year for Bitcoin. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4936.2s)]
*  Your thoughts on being right? I don't have much thoughts on that, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4942.84s)]
*  but my two comments are that I talked to a lot of Bitcoin traders and folks that seem to [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4947.8s)]
*  have a very good pulse and touch on this market. I don't say that I do because I don't really look [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4954.599999999999s)]
*  at it every day, but they seem to think that this thing is on a death march to 100K. I'm not sure [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4960.6s)]
*  whether that price is realistic or not in the year, but I will say that we're going to get to [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4966.4400000000005s)]
*  a tipping point where everybody really talks about this. I still don't think we're there yet. I think [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4973.240000000001s)]
*  we're just at the beginning, but when you see the inflows into these ETFs, JCal, it's like a very big [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4978.200000000001s)]
*  deal because it just allows every mom and pop individual to buy some to the extent that they [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4984.120000000001s)]
*  want to own it or they want to speculate on it, whatever it is. I think it's been a very big year, [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4990.28s)]
*  and I think that psychologically, it's proven a lot of folks wrong, and it's a setup for something [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=4997.16s)]
*  really constructive. The other thing I'll say is that it's not just Bitcoin, but as goes Bitcoin, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5005.16s)]
*  there are a handful of other things. People are now speculating that there's going to be [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5012.84s)]
*  an Ethereum ETF that gets approved as well because if you approve one, there's probably legitimate [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5017.240000000001s)]
*  cause to approve a few others. These things are becoming part of the financial fabric, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5023.320000000001s)]
*  and I think that that should not be underestimated. The SEC is still taking action against certain [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5028.12s)]
*  bad actors in crypto. There were a couple of those this week, but Bitcoin, Friedberg, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5033.4800000000005s)]
*  is incredibly resilient just on a technological basis. The fact that it hasn't broken down under [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5037.64s)]
*  stress, it hasn't had a denial of service type of attack, or a government hasn't been able to [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5044.28s)]
*  capture 51% of the mining or some great amount of it or just even be hacked in any way, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5052.679999999999s)]
*  you have to be impressed by the fundamental technology here at Friedberg. Maybe you'd speak [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5059.24s)]
*  to that level of success that this thing is so stable and trustworthy and reliable to date. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5063.0s)]
*  It's got a great incentive model. As long as Bitcoin price remains high, the miners will still [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5069.719999999999s)]
*  be there and the system will keep running. If Bitcoin price drops, transaction fees will [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5074.759999999999s)]
*  decline, the value of mining will decline, and it goes the other way as well. I think the real [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5081.16s)]
*  question is in the last couple of years, have we really seen a change in Bitcoin being used for [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5088.92s)]
*  transactions or for commerce in any meaningful way? I think the answer is still likely not. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5095.32s)]
*  No, definitely not. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5101.24s)]
*  It's really a stored value system and it's become this kind of stored value asset. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5102.12s)]
*  Friedberg, this microplastics thing, we talked about it on the show. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5106.36s)]
*  Since that time, I refused to open plastic bottles. I'm doing all glass. I'm getting rid of all this [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5111.96s)]
*  goddamn plastic. I already did glass bottles on my house because I'm cheap and I like to fill it [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5117.24s)]
*  from my water filter, but we're uncovering more information. Then I saw this headline this week [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5121.96s)]
*  that microplastics are in our blood streams in some cases. What the heck does that mean? [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5128.04s)]
*  It's worse than that. Team of scientists in Italy collected samples from patients that had plaque [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5135.24s)]
*  removed from the carotid artery. It's a common cardiac procedure where you get plaque that blocks [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5142.6s)]
*  up in your carotid. They go in, they remove the plaque. A total of 304 patients agreed to have [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5150.6s)]
*  the plaque that was removed from their artery submitted for analysis. Then what this team did [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5156.76s)]
*  is they took that plaque and they studied it to see how much plastic was found in that plaque. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5162.360000000001s)]
*  They used a bunch of measurement techniques to do this, including electron microscopy and mass spec [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5171.320000000001s)]
*  because it's really hard to find these molecules. Microplastics or nanoplastics, remember, are less [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5177.88s)]
*  than five millimeters in size with a mean level of 21 micrograms per milligram of plaque. Roughly [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5183.24s)]
*  one per 50 is the ratio of plastic to plaque that they found, which is really incredible because it [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5191.24s)]
*  shows that plastics, these little nano and microplastics are accumulating- [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5197.8s)]
*  Incredible good or incredible bad? [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5201.0s)]
*  Incredible bad. That these microplastics, these nanoplastics are accumulating in the human body. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5203.16s)]
*  Now here's the scary part. They then did a follow-up 34 months later. The patients that [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5208.599999999999s)]
*  had plastic in their blood had a four and a half times higher ratio or likelihood of having [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5214.12s)]
*  heart attack, stroke, or death from any cause. So all of these major health effects were four and [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5220.36s)]
*  a half times elevated in patients that had plastic in their blood. This was published in the New [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5228.2s)]
*  England Journal of Medicine, if I didn't say it. It really indicates that there is this kind of [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5232.6s)]
*  cumulative problem and that the cumulative problem is likely leading to really adverse health [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5236.120000000001s)]
*  outcomes. And I'll just highlight one other paper from a team in Germany and Norway back in May of [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5242.280000000001s)]
*  2022. And this team tried to figure out how plastics are causing adverse health effects in the body. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5247.64s)]
*  And they had a theory like, let's put little microplastics or nanoplastics together with all [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5254.200000000001s)]
*  the human cells that we know, shake it up and see what happens. And what they found were that these [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5258.12s)]
*  little plastic fragments were binding to dendritic cells and monocytes, key cells in the immune [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5263.16s)]
*  system. And when those cells were bound by plastic, they released these cytokines and the [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5268.36s)]
*  pro-inflammatory signals go through the roof. It causes the immune system to go high wire, [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5274.76s)]
*  increases inflammation, and the cascading effects of that obviously can ultimately lead to many of [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5279.5599999999995s)]
*  the events that we're mentioning were measured in this set of patients in Italy. So again, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5284.76s)]
*  we're just starting to uncover these effects, this concept that microplastics and nanoplastics [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5289.72s)]
*  that are accumulating. And let me just say these plastics are mostly PET, which is what we use to [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5295.400000000001s)]
*  make plastic bottles that we drink water and drinks out of, and PVC or polyvinyl chloride, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5299.96s)]
*  which is what a lot of our plastic plumbing and piping is made from. And so as little tiny bits [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5304.76s)]
*  of these plastic materials either are exposed to sunlight and break off and end up in our [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5310.04s)]
*  water and food supply and we consume them, they are slowly accumulating in bodies and they may [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5314.12s)]
*  be driving inflammatory response. They may be driving adverse health outcomes. We're really [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5319.48s)]
*  kind of tip of the iceberg and really studying this understanding and analyzing it. But here's [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5323.96s)]
*  another really interesting empirical data set that highlights that this really is a pretty [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5328.04s)]
*  significant half the patients had it. And of that half, they had a four and a half times higher [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5333.8s)]
*  chance of dying or having a heart attack or a stroke in the 34 months that followed. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5338.68s)]
*  Yeah, the thing that that study said, which was nuts is it looked like the nanoparticles, [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5343.96s)]
*  the nanoplastics and microplastics were effectively acting as scaffolding for plaque. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5350.6s)]
*  So in almost like it was a shim that allowed it to grow. The question is, would it have grown [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5355.16s)]
*  faster than it would have otherwise? That's even scarier. So I did not like reading that paper. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5362.36s)]
*  That really freaked me out. Really, really freaked me out. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5370.36s)]
*  I was drinking water from plastic water bottles this week and every time I drink water out of a [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5374.92s)]
*  plastic bottle now, I'm like, like nervous every time I take a sip. You're not supposed to double [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5379.48s)]
*  your the risk of all cause mortality by drinking a Fiji water. You know what I mean? Four and a half [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5384.599999999999s)]
*  X four and a half X for it's crazy in 34 months. Think about the cumulative effect over time. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5389.88s)]
*  Imagine drinking water out of a plastic bottle thinking you're doing the right thing and then [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5396.84s)]
*  trotting over to the recycling bin, you know, and you do that for 20 years, you may be killing [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5401.08s)]
*  yourself. Well, there it is. So wait, what's the, if you, if you, if the water glass bottles, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5407.08s)]
*  you must use, you cannot use plastic. You just cannot, no plastic, no plastic. You gotta stop. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5414.68s)]
*  It's over. It's done. It's done. Glass cans. Good plastic. Stainless steel. Stainless steel is fine. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5421.56s)]
*  Just like I mentioned when we talked about this a few weeks ago, the carbon footprint, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5428.6s)]
*  the environmental costs, the cash cost is much higher with all these alternatives to plastic. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5433.0s)]
*  So there are big challenges with respect to having some big massive response to plastics used in our [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5437.400000000001s)]
*  supply. But, you know, living in the luxury world that we all get to live in, we get to have that [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5443.48s)]
*  choice and we'll make that choice. But it's a real problem for humanity because plastics are so [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5448.12s)]
*  ubiquitous in so many things and they've, they've enabled, they've enabled affordability of consumer [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5453.48s)]
*  goods. This is such bulls**t. Honestly, like all you have to do is have glass bottles or carry a [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5458.12s)]
*  water bottle with you. Like I have a Contigo one I like, I carry it with me. I empty it. No, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5463.24s)]
*  J. Cal. And then I have a filter in my house and we fill water bottles and put them in the fridge. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5469.16s)]
*  No, but what if you like yogurt? Yogurt comes in a plastic container. There's all kinds of stuff. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5474.68s)]
*  You can't avoid plastic. That's what's so scary. We try to. And that's what's so scary. We do have [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5478.68s)]
*  a French yogurt that comes in glass bottles, but yes, it is hard. Yes, we do the French yogurt in [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5483.56s)]
*  glass bottles. It's so great. It's so good. It's delicious. Where do you get it from? [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5487.16s)]
*  There's a French yogurt that comes in glass bottles. French yogurt. But how do we get water in plastic? [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5491.56s)]
*  It's called like Le Penois or something. Le Penois? No, water. Water, you just install a filter [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5495.48s)]
*  system, which you have at the mausoleum and just fill huge glass bottles. Just have your staff fill [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5500.44s)]
*  glass bottles and put them in the fridge and don't throw them away. And give your kids like some of [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5507.16s)]
*  these thermoses or whatever, but don't have the water bottles. Like, you know, it's so funny. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5511.08s)]
*  It's been a disaster in the poker game in some ways. We got rid of it and there's been way more [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5515.4s)]
*  broken glass. People knock over the, you know, the side tables. I get it. It's been a huge pain, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5520.84s)]
*  but I will not go back. No, it's the right thing to do. Absolutely. Okay. Well, if Chamath is [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5527.16s)]
*  endorsing this, I guess I'm going to take it seriously. I think you got to do it. My opinion [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5533.72s)]
*  doesn't matter, Sext. I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm just saying that your threshold for becoming [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5538.6s)]
*  concerned is lower. And then if Chamath, if it hits Chamath's threshold, which is higher, I'm going [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5543.64s)]
*  to take it more seriously. As your bestie, I would like you to stop using plastic for the rest of [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5549.72s)]
*  your life. You're in a position to do it. I would ask you to not do it. All right, everybody. Welcome. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snbTCWL6rxo&t=5555.240000000001s)]
