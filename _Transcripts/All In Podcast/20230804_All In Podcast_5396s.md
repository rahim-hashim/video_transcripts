# E140 LK-99, Sclerotic establishments, Fitch downgrades US debt, Trump indicted... again
**All In Podcast:** [August 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo)
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa, sacks found the gel. Oh my god [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=0.0s)]
*  This guy he's running for office if he shows up with the red tie next week. We're fucked [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  That's the end of the show. He shows up with a red tie a blue shirt [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Are you coming out of your law retirement? Are you gonna be an active lawyer defending Trump sacks? You look really good [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  I gotta say with the with the job that looks that's a really good look. Let's go to the shower used a comb [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=17.56s)]
*  Oh the weekly shower in Italy. Good luck, right? It's not a bad look. Did you use soap? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=22.28s)]
*  No, I didn't have time didn't have 90 seconds. I didn't want to keep you guys waiting another two minutes [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=30.6s)]
*  Alright everybody welcome to another episode of the all-in podcast it is August [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  We just might have had the most consequential week in terms of politics and science [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=60.16s)]
*  in a long time could be could be the week of the year freeberg's been going nuts inside the group chat because [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=66.64s)]
*  Everyone is trying to replicate this LK 99 room temperature semiconductor [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=73.92s)]
*  experiment superconductor [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=79.44s)]
*  Superconductor. Yes. So god, I mean [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=81.68s)]
*  This has been I wasn't been like 10 days and now everybody is on Twitter trying to recreate this [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=85.08s)]
*  Maybe I should just let you cue this up freeberg since this is the first time [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=91.96s)]
*  Perhaps the last that we're gonna start the show at Science Corner. So Science Corner takeover week [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=96.64s)]
*  Tell us is this legit because you flip from this is a fraud to this is changing the world [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=101.48s)]
*  Like every day you seem to have a new piece of evidence. Where are you today with this? Is this the real deal? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=107.8s)]
*  Probably it's probably somewhere in the middle, but it leads to a path that could get us to the Holy Grail [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=113.76s)]
*  Which is room temperature [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  superconducting material which we've talked about twice on the show before and I [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=122.72s)]
*  Encourage folks to go look at the episode we did a couple ago after the original [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=126.16s)]
*  Claim was made a few months ago that turned out to not be true [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=131.0s)]
*  but the description in the paper that came out on how to make this material was [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=133.96s)]
*  Chased by hundreds of labs around the world over the last few days [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=139.88s)]
*  Folks have been live streaming it on these Chinese websites Billy Billy and Twitter and twitch [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=143.0s)]
*  everyone from [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=149.76s)]
*  Russian scientists to Chinese to Korean to American to European [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=151.64s)]
*  I will say one thing that I think is really profound which it is [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=156.68s)]
*  This is the first time in a very long time that I've seen so many people [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=160.88s)]
*  Share a unified voice about optimism about an abundant future [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=165.24s)]
*  Optimism about a big breakthrough rather than get on social media to share a voice about fear and [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=170.4s)]
*  Anger at someone or something and to hear everyone around the world get together and be excited about the potential of this discovery [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=177.4s)]
*  And its applications [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=184.36s)]
*  It's really profound to see and it's really amazing and wonderful to see now where we are a bunch of labs [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=185.88s)]
*  Took the described chemical structure of this material [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=192.6s)]
*  LK 99 which has lead and phosphorus oxygen and some copper in it and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=196.72s)]
*  Put it into these modeling systems these computer modeling systems to try and understand [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=202.48s)]
*  Where do the electrons flow? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=207.2s)]
*  where do the electrons sit in this material if this material is made the way it's described and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=209.2s)]
*  Five different labs have now published papers [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  That show that the way that this material is made is made [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=217.36s)]
*  To show that the way that this material is supposedly produced it should create these pathways or these energy states with the electrons [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=220.72s)]
*  That theoretically could enable superconductivity at a very high temperature [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=228.88s)]
*  And so that's an um a very confirmatory signal that computer modeling of the electron clouds because remember electrons [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=233.2s)]
*  Even though they move around the nucleus of an atom. We only kind of have a probability statement of where they are [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=240.48s)]
*  So if you look at all the probability statements of all the atoms stuck together and you try and figure out what's the aggregate [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  probability of where electrons are it indicates that there are these pathways that theoretically could allow for [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=252.86s)]
*  Electrons to move freely through the material and be completely [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=259.12s)]
*  void of any sort of resistance which is superconductivity and [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=263.12s)]
*  And so that's what's really profound [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=267.44s)]
*  About the modeling outputs from five very separate independent labs just so we're clear [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  When electricity normally moves down an electric wire or in computers and cpus gpus, whatever [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=274.0s)]
*  There's resistance that resistance results in loss. It results in heat [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=281.35999999999996s)]
*  And the only way we've been able to reduce that loss is by making it freezing cold like significantly cold totally right? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=285.84s)]
*  Yeah, so now if we were to do this when we didn't have to make a cold [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=292.56s)]
*  That means that these superconducting experiments move from the laboratory where it's forced to be cold [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  To the real world our desktop you used an analogy in chat that was really interesting of like a superconducting road [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=302.56s)]
*  Where and and then you don't lose energy right now. How much energy do we lose transporting it to our houses? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=309.44s)]
*  right, so [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=314.64s)]
*  You know, I would say on the order of 70 percent of energy we produce is lost to heat and friction [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=316.0s)]
*  Think about moving a car down the road when you move a car down the road [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=321.44s)]
*  You're having to put energy into overcome the friction of the car hitting the road [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=324.48s)]
*  So if the car could hover above the road [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=327.68s)]
*  The friction goes away and the energy needed to move the car goes way way down when you build a data center [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=329.84s)]
*  The electrons that are moving through the copper and the semiconductors bump into other atoms [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=334.88s)]
*  When they bump into the atoms in the material they shake those atoms when atoms shake that is heat [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=339.44s)]
*  So that's why copper wire heats up when you put electricity through it [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=344.56s)]
*  You're moving electrons through it some of those electrons bump into the copper atoms shakes the copper atoms [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=347.76s)]
*  They get hot and then some of the electrons make their way through [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=352.47999999999996s)]
*  The rate at which electrons are bumping into other atoms [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=355.36s)]
*  Is the resistance of the material? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=358.88s)]
*  And so all this energy is going into cooling down data centers and all this energy is lost in computing [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=361.36s)]
*  to heat and same in in electric motors could be reinvented semiconductors [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=367.2s)]
*  Integrated circuits would be reinvented and like I said if you had enough of this material you could put it in roads [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=372.72s)]
*  And because superconductors also reflect magnetic fields you could put magnets on the bottom of cars and float them above the ground [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=378.0s)]
*  And cruise around without any friction [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=384.71999999999997s)]
*  and if any of this is true [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=386.88s)]
*  the 70 loss of [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=389.44s)]
*  And then all this energy put into cooling data centers we could be looking at [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=391.84s)]
*  doubling or tripling [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=396.48s)]
*  The amount of energy available because we've built a certain amount of energy infrastructure [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=398.4s)]
*  So this would be all gains if we could figure out how to yeah, but ever just technology massive gains and massive abundance [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=402.64s)]
*  It would lower the cost of electricity by [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=409.12s)]
*  10 100 percent [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=411.52s)]
*  I mean look assuming huge infrastructure investments, which would take probably decades to do sure you would you would get there [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=413.2s)]
*  But in the near term there are these incredible applications quantum computers [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=419.04s)]
*  Are built using little superconductors as the qubit and so the superconductor holds the qubit state [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=422.88s)]
*  So this idea that we could now have room temperature quantum computing is also a very profound one game changer [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  Low cost and and the first thing that would be changed is likely electronic components [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=435.6s)]
*  So we would take electronic components and redesign them using superconducting material [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=439.36s)]
*  That would allow you to reduce heat loss and energy loss and that would have a big transformative effect [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  On for example the big effort right now to make more ai chips gpu chips to do matrix transformations [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=448.08000000000004s)]
*  There is some precedent for this [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=453.92s)]
*  People are now creating optical [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=456.0s)]
*  Bridges between gpus and cpus in order to reduce the heat so they're using optics basically [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=458.56s)]
*  Light to transfer inter-connects. Yeah. Yeah, that's been the big [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  Lift right now from what I understand in gpus and data centers is just moving the data [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=468.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's it I mean we could go on for hours on that but like yes [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=473.84s)]
*  I mean this would just be a game changer electronic componentry photonic chips, right? Yeah photonic chips [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=477.44s)]
*  But look this this is obviously a little bit separate [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=482.24s)]
*  But here's where we are. So lk99 there's all these simulation models that show this thing could work [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=485.12s)]
*  But there's two two things I will say came out of this from some of the simulations [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=489.52s)]
*  The first is remember this is a crystal with mostly lead atoms [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=493.2s)]
*  And these lead atoms some of them get replaced by copper and when when they get replaced by copper [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=498.24s)]
*  It causes the crystal structure to change by 0.46 degrees is what the koreans say [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=504.0s)]
*  The angle changes by 0.46 degrees and when that happens that bending [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=509.04s)]
*  Causes the electrons in all the atoms in the crystal to overlap slightly and that overlapping effect [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=513.28s)]
*  Causes this free-flowing electron tunnel that that's the red that is the theory for why the superconducts now [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=519.04s)]
*  What the simulation showed is that you have to replace only one of the lead [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  Atoms not any of the other ones in order for this to work [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=530.5600000000001s)]
*  And that could explain why everyone's having different results in the lab trying to reproduce this [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=533.6s)]
*  Because when you bake this stuff in an oven if the copper gets into the wrong atom space in the crystal [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=538.08s)]
*  It doesn't work [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=543.92s)]
*  And so that's why some of these things might end up looking good and some of them don't look good and some of them [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=545.28s)]
*  There was a lab yesterday in china that published no resistance, but they had to cool it down [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=549.52s)]
*  To 100 degrees below freezing and so it wasn't at room temperature, but it did superconducted. It did have no resistance 170 kelvins [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=555.36s)]
*  I think is where they got it. Yeah, so 100 cells 100 below zero [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=562.08s)]
*  So in other words, there is a key [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=565.44s)]
*  There's a key here in the molecular structure that you have to just thread perfectly [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=567.44s)]
*  You have to replace the right lead atom with the copper in order for this to work [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=572.16s)]
*  And so that's a technically very and and what happened by the way fidelity issue [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=576.16s)]
*  That's a tool issue like you have to have the right tool to do it or is it luck or right now? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=579.84s)]
*  So here's the crazy story and i'll tell you guys this I don't know how real this is but the guys claim [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=584.8000000000001s)]
*  So remember these two scientists lee and kim [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=589.52s)]
*  Supposedly saw this material in a lab in 1999. That's why it's called lk lee and kim 99 [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=593.1s)]
*  And so in 99 they came across this and they could not replicate it [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=600.48s)]
*  They had no idea how to make it again and it disappeared and they didn't have the sample again [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=603.44s)]
*  They then spent the next 20 years of their life [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=607.76s)]
*  One was a college professor and the other one worked for lg as a battery engineer [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=610.48s)]
*  And they just had these random normal everyday lives [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=614.32s)]
*  It reminds me of denis quaid in the movie the rookie where he had like this amazing arm and he was going to go to the mlb [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=616.8s)]
*  And then something happened and he spent the rest of his life as a high school pe teacher [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=622.32s)]
*  And then 20 years later he gets his arm back and he goes to the lb and he plays in a major league baseball game [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=626.4s)]
*  Because all of a sudden in during covet these guys got some funding they set up a company [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=631.36s)]
*  They went into a lab and they rediscovered this material and apparently this is the rumor [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=635.28s)]
*  I don't know if this is real the rumor is they had it in they were baking it in an oven in a vacuum sealed tube [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=639.68s)]
*  And when the guy took it out of the oven, he accidentally bumped into a table and the tube cracked [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=645.92s)]
*  And when the tube cracked it did something to the material and then they measured it and oh my god [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  It's room temperature superconductor. That's the current theory of what the rumor of what happened is a video [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=654.3199999999999s)]
*  That's like peter parker being bitten by a radioactive spider. I mean [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=658.88s)]
*  Doesn't make any sense [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=663.1999999999999s)]
*  So here's the drama this guy kwan got inserted to oversee them [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=666.0799999999999s)]
*  It's like their cto the guy that gave the money to q center said he's got to oversee you [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=669.28s)]
*  Kwan apparently got fired from his job in march and he was kicked out of this company was no longer affiliated [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=673.6s)]
*  And the rumor is that kwan took all the lab data and these guys in 2020 during covet they discovered this [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=679.68s)]
*  They started filing patents and working on the manufacturing process trying to figure out how to replicate it and do it again [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=685.04s)]
*  They had all this data, but they weren't going to publish it [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=689.76s)]
*  They didn't want the world to know about it yet [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=691.44s)]
*  And then all of a sudden kwan gathers all this data probably disgruntled after getting fired [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=693.2s)]
*  Puts it into a paper and puts it on the internet [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=698.08s)]
*  So that's the first paper that came out because there's a website called r a r x iv [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=700.08s)]
*  Is there a pronunciation for this website? So this is where you can open source file scientific papers, right? Okay [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=706.4s)]
*  so this is a place for [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=712.32s)]
*  dropping papers outside of the [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=714.72s)]
*  The traditional journal yeah [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=718.16s)]
*  The the traditional journal process requires peer review and there's editors at the journal that decide whether or not to publish your paper [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=719.6s)]
*  So sometimes gatekeepers. Yeah gatekeepers [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=726.08s)]
*  And so if you don't want to do that, you just want to get a story out to the world right away [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=728.0s)]
*  So during covet everyone was publishing on the site while their updates on research they were doing to help the world figure out [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=730.96s)]
*  What's going on with covet? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=735.92s)]
*  So it's a great place to just hit the world with your data hit the world with your findings. This is like acoustic raw [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=737.2s)]
*  Papers and it's called archive a r x iv [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=743.12s)]
*  Dot org if you want to go see it archive so anyone anyone can publish a pdf. No one knows if it's real or not [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=747.28s)]
*  It hasn't been peer reviewed etc [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=752.24s)]
*  So this guy's one [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=753.92s)]
*  Yeah, so kwan drops the paper with his name lee kim and kwan on the paper only three people can win a noble prize [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=755.28s)]
*  So the theory is he did this to get his name out there to make sure he could lock in his name for the noble prize [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=761.1999999999999s)]
*  Wow [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=765.76s)]
*  And then within a day lee and kim and four people they've been working with some including some folks in the u.s [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=766.8s)]
*  Published another paper with better data, but it was also rushed out. And so both papers are pretty ugly [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=773.76s)]
*  I gotta be honest. They're like pretty messy. They don't have a great deal of clarity. There's errors in them. There's mistakes [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=778.4799999999999s)]
*  There's redundancy. There's little basic chart editing errors stupid stuff. Clearly. This was a rush job [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=784.0s)]
*  But these guys rushed out and said you know what if this is going to be public we now have to correct the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=789.76s)]
*  The the story and say what happened so they put this thing out [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=793.84s)]
*  They wanted to get their claim in to get their noble peace prize, which would indicate [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=796.0s)]
*  That would lean towards a piece of evidence as would people funding them 25 years later that would indicate [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=800.5600000000001s)]
*  Maybe there's something there two things worth noting on the simulation stuff number one [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=806.48s)]
*  Obviously you got to get the copper in the right place and the production way to do that [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=810.08s)]
*  How do we actually engineer that to happen? [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=814.96s)]
*  It's not really clear baking it in an oven clearly is creating what's called heterogeneous results [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=817.12s)]
*  Meaning everyone's getting different results [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=821.68s)]
*  Around the world that have been doing this for the last couple days and everyone's really confused. Is this real? Is it fake? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=823.68s)]
*  I don't know, but that simulation explains why there's maybe lots of different results another comment [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=828.0799999999999s)]
*  It turns out that one of the simulation team said hey if you put gold instead of copper in the spot [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=833.6s)]
*  It's a better superconductor. It could actually be a better material [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=838.64s)]
*  So it's opening up all these paths for exploration [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=841.76s)]
*  That we had never considered before that there's this whole new approach to creating superconducting materials that was not on anyone's radar before [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=844.72s)]
*  So this is opening up a whole new realm and I think this is going to unfold over the next couple of years [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=851.52s)]
*  With more material discovery more invention coming off of this initial discovery and simulation model that then [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=855.52s)]
*  Offers all these other opportunities for creating potentially new materials that maybe are easier to manufacture and better to produce [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=862.48s)]
*  And the final thing i'll say is that there are some teams that are commenting [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=868.8s)]
*  That are saying that this thing may be superconducting [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=872.96s)]
*  But only on one dimension which means along a line of atoms or line of molecules [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=875.6s)]
*  In the material so [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=880.64s)]
*  Normal superconductors think about them as like a 3d matrix and the electrons can flow through [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=882.96s)]
*  Freely through any direction through the matrix through the crystal and in this case they're saying the electrons can only flow [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=887.92s)]
*  freely across a line [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=894.72s)]
*  In this material and so now there's another question of wait [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=896.8s)]
*  How do you manufacture lots of lines to run in parallel to make this thing truly superconducting at scale? [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=899.6s)]
*  So that's all the hard technical stuff that's emerging right now [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=904.5600000000001s)]
*  Whether or not this actually does turn into a room temperature superconducting material that can be industrialized [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=907.76s)]
*  And used in all these applications everyone's really excited about I think it's probably months to years away from knowing [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=913.36s)]
*  But at this point there's a great set of indications that oh my god. We might be onto something new [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=919.44s)]
*  There's a whole new path of discovery a whole new path of engineering and invention [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=924.24s)]
*  And it's amazing to just see everyone gather around this and get so excited about it because it really will [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=928.32s)]
*  Change so much about the world and create extraordinary abundance and prosperity for humanity [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=932.88s)]
*  If this proves to be real and industrializable and scalable [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=937.6800000000001s)]
*  Chamath, can I ask a simple question here when you say if this proves to be real if nobody has reproduced the result [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=941.2s)]
*  Why is there any belief that this is real? There are properties of this that look I think we have to take a step back [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=948.0s)]
*  We have found superconductive materials in the past there are many ceramics that are superconductive [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=955.84s)]
*  Mercury is superconductive [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=961.22s)]
*  There's all kinds of elements and materials and compounds in the physical world that we've already figured out have these properties [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=962.82s)]
*  So this is not like a new thing that's never been found before [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=970.02s)]
*  It's just this idea of trying to find it at a certain temperature where it could exist naturally in the normal world without all this expensive [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=973.62s)]
*  Cooling, okay, but there is a separate thing which is that we also have found a whole bunch of [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=981.54s)]
*  materials that [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=988.48s)]
*  look and behave like [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=990.5600000000001s)]
*  Superconductors but are really not they're what's called just diamagnetic [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=993.82s)]
*  And I think right now what what people are trying to sort out is is this a clever [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=997.6800000000001s)]
*  Diamagnet is this diamagnetism? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1003.82s)]
*  Or is it superconductive and these are huge differences that swing this from yeah, it's kind of a cool thing [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1006.96s)]
*  And yeah, whatever. There's a bunch of other materials we found that are like this too [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1013.9200000000001s)]
*  Wow, this is transformational and right now we don't know any of that and I think that [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1017.4399999999999s)]
*  all of the mystery around this is mostly because [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1022.4799999999999s)]
*  People can be on one side of the debate or the other literally by the second based on what new simulation or what new? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1025.84s)]
*  piece of research people are putting out there [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1033.44s)]
*  but you have to remember like [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1036.08s)]
*  Diamagnetism is like a property of matter superconductivity is a state of matter. It is totally different [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1038.3799999999999s)]
*  All superconductors are diamagnetic, but all diamagnets are not superconductive. So we could just be [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1044.88s)]
*  Extremely excited about not much of anything [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1052.78s)]
*  Or this could really be a breakthrough if what the chinese guys said is that they were able to cool this thing down and get [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1057.3600000000001s)]
*  It to be superconductive [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1062.88s)]
*  Then that does at 170k. It doesn't mean much in my opinion, right? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1064.56s)]
*  It's not room temperature, but it does indicate that this material can be superconductive [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1068.56s)]
*  Look there are many materials like this. There's like a lot of forms of red matter that we've already found that at that temperature [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1073.14s)]
*  Gradient at that range of temperatures can be superconductive. It's not practically useful at that point [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1079.3000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. I don't think you're going to see like some massive revolution. So i'm a betting man [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1085.22s)]
*  I make bets. I think i've talked about when there was this guy [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1089.7s)]
*  Ranga Diaz that had to try this stuff and he was sort of refuted in what he was working on [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1092.9s)]
*  But 18 months before that happened, I was trying to get a deal done with the university of rochester to buy all that ip [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1097.3000000000002s)]
*  So i've been grinding in and around this space for a couple of years [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1102.98s)]
*  My intuition on this is that this is diamagnetic [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1107.7800000000002s)]
*  and I think and I think we're going to find that you know, it was [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1111.0600000000002s)]
*  It's like yet another material added to the list of materials and it's okay [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1115.94s)]
*  But hopefully what it really does is it is it sparks an interest in? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1120.98s)]
*  In a lot of other people putting more money behind this nick if you could pull up this [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1125.7800000000002s)]
*  Manifold markets, uh, there's a prediction market called manifold dot markets that people have been sharing a link from [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1129.86s)]
*  betting markets where people bet either side of this will lk [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1137.06s)]
*  99 room temp ambient pressure serving conductivity [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1141.3799999999999s)]
*  Preprint replicate before 2025 and you can see it's about 30 chance you what do you think of the prediction markets assessing this? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1144.98s)]
*  Freeberg, yeah, I think it's probably that's probably a good handicap for where we are [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1152.26s)]
*  I'll say when you look at a [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1158.3400000000001s)]
*  diamagnetic material and so what that means a diamagnet will expel magnetic fields of both polarities a paramagnet will [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1160.4s)]
*  Reflect the north or the south pole its north pole will reflect the north pole of another magnetic material, right? [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1169.46s)]
*  diamagnets you can put north or south pole and they reflect both [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1175.3600000000001s)]
*  And there's plenty of videos you can watch of putting a frog [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1178.98s)]
*  In like a 10 tesla machine and the frog floats technically a frog is diamagnetic [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1182.42s)]
*  But what happens typically with diamagnetic materials is they orient themselves while they're while they're freely floating into a particular direction [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1187.7s)]
*  So there's going to be three things people are going to be looking for in terms of confirmatory proof on lk 99 [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1195.14s)]
*  The first is does this material float like a superconductor over a magnetic field because remember superconductors perfectly expel magnetic fields [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1200.18s)]
*  They are diamagnets to the absolute degree. They perfectly reflect all magnetic fields [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1207.54s)]
*  So if you put a superconducting material above a magnetic field [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1213.22s)]
*  It should kind of float freely and spin around and stuff if it orients back to one position [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1216.1s)]
*  It probably means that there's something going on [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1220.98s)]
*  Where it's maybe not a perfect superconductor now all these videos the second thing you're going to look for is zero resistance [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1223.62s)]
*  So can you actually pass an electric charge through it and have no resistance in the material? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1228.8999999999999s)]
*  So you're seeing data coming out now that's indicating we're seeing that but we're seeing it at a low temperature [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1233.3s)]
*  No one's yet replicated this at room temperature [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1238.26s)]
*  And the third thing is a transition which means that there's a point where it shifts because that's a classic [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1240.8200000000002s)]
*  Characteristic of superconducting materials that there's a transition temperature transition phase where the material becomes superconducting or it's not superconducting [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1247.2s)]
*  Um, so those kind of generally those three experimental proof points are what everyone's looking for thus far [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1254.42s)]
*  The videos we've seen look like ufo or bigfoot videos. They're freaking grainy [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1260.66s)]
*  They're like, you know, you guys have seen some of these videos that have come out. They're like at a distance [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1265.22s)]
*  It's like wait, why didn't you do the whole angle? Why did you only take a picture? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1269.5400000000002s)]
*  Why didn't you do the video? There's this woman in russia who's right now in ufo territory people are [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1272.26s)]
*  Yeah, look at this. I mean it's super like there's a raw. There's a little flake of here's a video of a little flake [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1278.1000000000001s)]
*  Of a material that someone supposedly made in the lab or it could be death on the camera [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1284.18s)]
*  Right, and they put it over the super the over a very strong magnet and this is the video they got it's super blurry [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1288.42s)]
*  There's a woman in russia and she totally reinvented the manufacturing process [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1293.7800000000002s)]
*  She's actually well known scientist. So she's not bs [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1298.1s)]
*  And she said I made this thing in my house using a furnace and I used a whole new process [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1301.1399999999999s)]
*  So she does this whole new process. She live streams the whole thing [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1304.8999999999999s)]
*  And then she puts out a video of the thing floating in a straw [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1307.9399999999998s)]
*  It's a sorry a video photo and it's a blurry photo and people are like show us the video show us that it's real [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1311.3799999999999s)]
*  And she's refusing to so this whole thing is feeling a little like there's ufo bigfoot type people out there [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1316.82s)]
*  That we're not really seeing clarity on is this real and then obviously the resistance data [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1322.1s)]
*  There's very credible academic universities coming out and I will also say there are a number of labs [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1326.1s)]
*  There's one in china and the one in china that measured the the zero resistance at negative 100 degrees [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1330.74s)]
*  They created 8 000 samples so they found one that worked [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1338.18s)]
*  There's another lab that did eight different pathways of manufacturing it in china and they said we can't find any that work yet [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1341.3799999999999s)]
*  So, you know, there's a lot of [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1347.3s)]
*  Negative indications as well, which is why the prediction markets are probably right [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1349.3s)]
*  But I do think that this theoretical explanation [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1353.5400000000002s)]
*  That you have to get the copper atom to replace the correct lead atom in the crystal structure [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1356.5s)]
*  explains a lot of the heterogeneity and results and the reason why people may not be able to replicate this and if someone can [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1362.4s)]
*  Crack the code on how do we actually engineer this thing and produce it correctly based on the theory? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1367.7s)]
*  Maybe we'll see different better results [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1373.14s)]
*  But again, that's also theoretical because no one seems to have nailed the manufacturing process here [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1374.9s)]
*  So lots of data coming in every day by next week we could be clapping and you know cheering [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1379.46s)]
*  Or you know, we could sort of be on this very long grind sort of like russia ukraine [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1385.0600000000002s)]
*  Just a long grind and it's a it'll last years [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1389.7s)]
*  And maybe someone will win. Maybe someone won't or maybe it just opens up a whole new set of explorations [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1393.7800000000002s)]
*  For new superconducting materials at room temperature that could change the world [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1398.18s)]
*  I gotta say the thing I love most about this is like we have this oppenheimer film comes out [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1401.3000000000002s)]
*  And at the same time this happens we got ufo [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1406.42s)]
*  testimonials, you know, uh in congressional hearings all of this energy at the same time [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1410.72s)]
*  Of people who are just really stoked to do material science to do basic science to figure out big problems [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1416.1s)]
*  And uh, I agree with you the optimism around all this [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1422.34s)]
*  Is is I mean how can something else tell me something else in our lifetime in our in the last decade or two? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1426.5s)]
*  Where we've seen the whole world [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1433.1399999999999s)]
*  Say in a positive way something great could happen [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1435.1399999999999s)]
*  Instead of something bad could happen and someone's to blame for something [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1438.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean it really is in my mind the first time i've really seen this happen in a very long time [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1441.46s)]
*  Maybe the internet was a was a kind of great moment. Yeah [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1446.8999999999999s)]
*  Everybody being connected everybody being able to share information [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1450.58s)]
*  For all over the world doing it on twitter and billy billy and youtube and like all sharing this stuff [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1454.1799999999998s)]
*  and saying my gosh, we could have this breakthrough together as a [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1459.3s)]
*  As a civil as a species not like a country not a individual not a who messed up who did something wrong [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1462.66s)]
*  Who's to blame who's on the other side? It's like dude if we all do if this happens [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1469.54s)]
*  We're all going to be like [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1473.6200000000001s)]
*  Chilling on the beach. It's going to be amazing. Like this is awesome. So we're gonna have [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1475.14s)]
*  We're gonna have a rash of vcs running into this next [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1479.22s)]
*  And start funding the stuff material science. Yeah. Yeah, I mean my attitude is kind of like wake me up when you know, it's real [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1484.1000000000001s)]
*  Because it's nice that if this is real then [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1491.22s)]
*  It's great that there's all this positive energy around it, but that's like a big caveat [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1498.02s)]
*  Until we know that there's something real here [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1501.9399999999998s)]
*  I think it's premature for everybody to say that this is like some wonderful thing now [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1505.06s)]
*  If we find out that the science is real and then it's just a debate over commercialization of it [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1510.34s)]
*  Then yeah, I agree. That would be like a really positive moment [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1514.74s)]
*  I just love the fact that when something positive in the world happens or when something negative happens [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1517.3s)]
*  We have this amazing platform for everybody social media x.com formerly twitter [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1520.9s)]
*  Where everybody can get together around this campfire and just start discussing it and speculating now some people don't like speculation [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1526.26s)]
*  Obviously if there's a school shooting or a tragedy a building burns down [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1531.94s)]
*  The fog of war as we've seen in the constant ukraine [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1536.5s)]
*  coverage, you know, you can have [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1540.42s)]
*  It's very easy to make mistakes when you're hashing this stuff in real time, but I love the real time nature [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1543.22s)]
*  Of the world and the pace we're moving at it's it's kind of delightful to me [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1548.82s)]
*  I don't have a problem with the speculation and there is a fun element to it [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1552.1799999999998s)]
*  But when you start talking about investing in it [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1555.3799999999999s)]
*  Like I said wake me up when you know, it's real. There's a really funny meme that vc bragg's posted [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1558.98s)]

*  The last hype cycle the last hype cycle creator economy crypto web three. Yeah, it's pretty funny. It's pretty [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1597.06s)]
*  I will say sex. I um, I told you mathis when we were in italy last week [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1602.58s)]
*  But uh when I was 13 years old jay cal can make fun of me now [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1606.8999999999999s)]
*  I did a science fair project on superconductors actually I was doing it when I was 13 [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1610.1799999999998s)]
*  And I bought this superconductor from the back of popular science magazine [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1614.82s)]
*  You know this old yttrium barium copper oxide. That was the one that won the nobel prize [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1618.4199999999998s)]
*  You could buy it for nothing [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1621.94s)]
*  And I got liquid nitrogen at ucla and I did a demo at the science fair and I did a poster board and I [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1623.38s)]

*  This is the future. We're about to have room temperature superconductors. It's about to happen [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1632.0200000000002s)]
*  And we're gonna have flying cars and we're gonna have limitless energy and limitless battery storage for energy by the way [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1636.2600000000002s)]
*  Which is one of the big applications [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1641.8600000000001s)]
*  And it's it's just on the break and this was when I was 13 years old 1993, you know, here we are 30 30 years old [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1644.66s)]
*  30 years later [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1650.9s)]
*  And everyone feels like this moment might be upon us, but it has been this thing that's always been elusive [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1653.6200000000001s)]
*  But everyone's always thought it's around the corner. Well, it sounds like cold fusion, you know, we've always been [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1658.0200000000002s)]
*  10 years away for some breakthrough in cold fusion self-driving cars [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1662.98s)]
*  Artificial general intelligence. Yeah. Well, I think there's a difference between [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1667.0400000000002s)]
*  this physical world material sciences type innovation and then software innovation and [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1670.98s)]
*  One of peter teal's critiques is that we've had tremendous innovation in software [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1676.42s)]
*  But in every other aspect of the economy [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1681.62s)]
*  There's been little to no innovation planes, for example are getting slower not faster [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1684.34s)]
*  Would you believe that position from from him? I I don't buy that [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1688.82s)]
*  Well, I mean with the exception of like what elon has been doing [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1693.54s)]
*  He he misses life sciences entirely in that point, I don't know. I mean [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1698.8999999999999s)]
*  Genomics is largely software based at this point. If you look at the hardware revolution driven by gene editing [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1703.06s)]
*  Oncology the breakthroughs. I mean look it's all slowing down [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1708.8s)]
*  I do agree with him if you look at the number of um approved drugs every year and the cost [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1711.6999999999998s)]
*  Per drug cost per drugs going the wrong direction and the number of drugs per year is going in the wrong direction [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1716.5s)]
*  So there is an argument to be made there [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1723.1399999999999s)]
*  But there there are arguably some quantum leaps in the types of medicine that we're applying we didn't have biologics [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1725.54s)]
*  You know 40 years ago. We didn't have gene therapy 10 years ago [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1731.62s)]
*  These are new modalities for for therapies that didn't exist as we've engineered the molecular world to do amazing things in the biochemical application space [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1735.3s)]
*  So I think um, there's elements of this that I disagree with but I think the general trend lines as he points out [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1743.1399999999999s)]
*  Is totally true. Yeah, but with planes I think we made a conscious decision. He always cites the plane issue [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1748.26s)]
*  Hey, we don't have the concord. We're going backwards in terms of speed. I think that was a deliberate [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1753.3s)]
*  Cost cutting measure because people aren't willing to pay to go faster and burn more fuel [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1759.7s)]
*  So they're economic innovation the price gets cheaper. That's right. That's right. Same with electricity [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1764.1799999999998s)]
*  Same with energy like electricity is getting more expensive not cheaper [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1769.6999999999998s)]
*  but if you look at the massive if we wouldn't have the massive gains in [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1773.78s)]
*  artificial intelligence and machine learning if it hadn't been for the revolution in gpu storage and data centers and [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1777.6s)]
*  Microprocessors and [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1785.6799999999998s)]
*  The iphone but that's kind of the point is that we were promised flying cars and instead we got 280 characters [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1787.3799999999999s)]
*  Not that twitter slash x is bad, but that's just where all the innovation has been is in it that I agree with [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1792.6599999999999s)]
*  So they figure it out. They keep figuring out how to put more circuits on a transistor or whatever and you know [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1798.26s)]
*  Keep morse law going or I don't know. I could show you [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1803.3s)]
*  I could make a different argument by showing you human lifespan [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1807.06s)]
*  And agricultural yields. I mean agricultural yields continue to climb [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1810.02s)]
*  Because of our ability to engineer in a smarter and better way every generation there [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1813.6999999999998s)]
*  There's a lot of counter arguments to them I would say what's valid about it is we go ahead chema [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1817.94s)]
*  I was going to say the reason we don't see these kinds of innovations is because [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1823.86s)]
*  The ruling class has clogged up and sclerotically dominated all the places where you'd have this massive [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1828.58s)]
*  Forms of innovation like and regulatory capture. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, that's like i'm talking about university [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1835.1399999999999s)]
*  That's like a boogeyman. So get the boogeyman out the regulatory captures there forever [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1841.94s)]
*  Like why was this paper published on artsin because [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1846.3400000000001s)]
*  Every other form of publishing mechanism is sclerotic. It's establishment. It's hierarchical [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1850.5800000000002s)]
*  It's about people basically dominating their own little forms of paola [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1856.42s)]
*  Right, and so nature jama all of this stuff works this way. And so what happens you don't get fundamental innovations that happen in labs [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1860.5s)]
*  you have things that feed [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1868.18s)]
*  research proposals that feed [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1870.42s)]
*  People who need to basically establish their supremacy you saw the stanford professor get booted out because of stuff that you know, he [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1872.9s)]
*  the president of stanford [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1879.7s)]
*  The president said so why is all this happening? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1881.3000000000002s)]
*  Well peter is right. The reason why this stuff is happening is that instead of places where true fundamental innovation can happen [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1883.46s)]
*  If you look at the nobel prize winners and you do distribution by age, what do you find? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1888.9s)]
*  People win nobels in their 60s for work that they did in their 20s and 30s [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1893.7s)]
*  Right, and so you have a system now that rewards people staying in their positions. I wrote this in [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1898.42s)]
*  One of my annual letters if you look at the average age of like leading people in schools [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1904.82s)]
*  They're like 70 years old if you look inside of congress, so there's all of this stuff that just kind of sclerotically prevents [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1910.34s)]
*  Young naive people from basically going out and really pushing the boundaries in specifically this case of science of fundamental science [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1918.02s)]
*  And so for every innovation, I think the question to ask is what other innovations are we missing? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1925.22s)]
*  And if innovations are on a fundamentally [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1930.98s)]
*  Well established pathway that defends a bunch of work of senior people before it [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1934.02s)]
*  It'll get supported and I would say that genetics is a perfect example of that [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1938.74s)]
*  The other if you look at the if you look at the number of rare diseases that have still that are still like unsolved or the [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1943.54s)]
*  Lack of understanding of immunode disease. It's just crazy. Like it's I just think that that's really what's happening [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1948.8999999999999s)]
*  I think peter's more right than he's wrong [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1954.6599999999999s)]
*  The other issue here sax is and I like to get your feedback on this is if you look at how venture capital works [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1956.1799999999998s)]
*  You got a 10-year window you want to get returns for your lps. You look at how this fundamental research [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1962.26s)]
*  We just said this started in 1999. That's why it's called dash 99. This thing took 25 years to get to this point [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1968.1s)]
*  Is is part of this issue that you have this big opportunity zone between? [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1975.22s)]
*  Say ventures window 10 years and then academia which you put out like four decades there chum up 20 [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1980.82s)]
*  You know year olds getting their rewards in their 60s [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1988.1s)]
*  How much of this has to do if we don't have a platform in between venture and academia? That's not the problem [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1990.58s)]
*  I mean [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1996.66s)]
*  so it's true that vc [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=1997.3799999999999s)]
*  funding typically you want to go to the commercialization of an idea [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2000.5s)]
*  And that the underlying platform shift already exists and usually that comes from some sort of breakthrough that happened in academia [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2005.3000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's basically what happened with the internet. So yeah, you do not want [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2012.3400000000001s)]
*  vc funding typically going to [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2016.42s)]
*  Basic rnd, you know fundamental science rnd. It's just really expensive takes too long and too unknown [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2019.6200000000001s)]
*  So you want that stuff kind of done more at the academic level? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2026.3400000000001s)]
*  The question I have is how much of what's happening in academia is basically? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2030.18s)]
*  Either irrelevant or fraudulent. So jamath you brought the stanford president. I think the the story there is he had five papers [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2034.98s)]
*  about alzheimer's research and you know related topics like that [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2042.66s)]
*  where they found out that the papers are basically bogus and [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2047.0600000000002s)]
*  Quasi fraudulent [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2051.62s)]
*  So how much of the the work that's being done in academia? How many of these papers are basically? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2053.2200000000003s)]
*  Bogus well the thing with peer review is like it's presented like it's a great incredible solution to the world's problems [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2058.42s)]
*  But I think what it has inherently wrong with it. So the positive part of it is theoretically you have error correction [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2065.46s)]
*  Right, but here what you don't find is that that error correction actually even happened [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2071.6200000000003s)]
*  And so it takes like some young 20 year old kid at stanford who's a journalist whose family were journalists to basically figure that up [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2076.34s)]
*  So instead what were those what were those papers doing? They were supporting [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2083.06s)]
*  A rising up-and-coming person because they thought that you know, he would support them at some point [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2087.62s)]
*  This is like the whole corrupt falchi system at the nih trade berg. They're jamath and sax are presenting academia is corrupt [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2091.94s)]
*  Do you agree with that? I don't know if corrupt is the right term because I think that implies mal intent [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2099.3799999999997s)]
*  I think that the incentives are wrong. So in order to get funded [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2104.3399999999997s)]
*  You have to show results. No one gets a grant [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2108.5s)]
*  To disprove someone else's work. No one gets a grant to do confirmatory work on someone else's work [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2111.62s)]
*  You get a grant you get it. Yeah [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2118.42s)]
*  I mean that's that's the argument that that some folks make you get a grant [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2120.34s)]
*  To do breakthrough research and have breakthroughs and if you have breakthroughs you get more money [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2124.2599999999998s)]
*  That's the way the system is set up. But this is why this guy this is why well, let me just finish corrupt [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2129.06s)]
*  I think it's corrupt. They're not funny breakthroughs. Come on [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2134.2599999999998s)]
*  Okay, whatever you want to define it as the guy the guy at stanford if you read some of the testimony [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2138.02s)]
*  From people in his labs [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2142.7400000000002s)]
*  They said that he encouraged people to have big findings and if you get big findings you get to progress in the organization [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2144.34s)]
*  You get more funding etc [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2150.7400000000002s)]
*  So the the incentive structure that he set up for people was not necessarily to go in and disprove stuff [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2152.7400000000002s)]
*  Or try something and show that it didn't work [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2158.1s)]
*  If you try something and show that it didn't work and publish a paper on that [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2160.7400000000002s)]
*  It's going to be very hard for you to turn around and get a trophy or get some money or get a grant [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2164.6600000000003s)]
*  What he did there was like a bunch of error in the data that they went back and were like hey [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2169.0600000000004s)]
*  This is this was incorrect and he's like, oh, yeah, it was sloppy. I just didn't do a good job of reviewing it [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2172.98s)]
*  So yeah [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2178.5800000000004s)]
*  So what happened was if you read some of the testimony the people that worked in his labs the students and the graduate students and so on [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2178.98s)]
*  They said that he basically encouraged people to get good results [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2185.3s)]
*  And in that process and in that way [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2189.0600000000004s)]
*  There was some fuzziness in the data or some tweaking of the data that he didn't double check for sure [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2191.38s)]
*  But he was encouraging this sort of system of performance and the system of performance says you've got to show results [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2196.34s)]
*  You can't show non-results and if you show non-results, there's no money and there [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2203.22s)]
*  Yeah, the reason they're doing that is marketing they want to market and get more attention so they get more donations [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2206.82s)]
*  Yeah, exactly the problem with with a pure research is that you have to get funding to do your research [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2213.7799999999997s)]
*  Where do you get your funding from you get your funding from federal agencies from non-profits? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2219.14s)]
*  From your um, you know your donors and so in order to get that money [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2223.46s)]
*  You have to say here's what i'm going to do. Here's not what here's you don't say i'm going to go not prove something [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2228.1s)]
*  You say i'm going to go prove something. No, no, but you're hiding the cheese. Can you stop hiding the cheese? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2232.58s)]
*  That's not what these people are saying. These people aren't saying i'm not going to not prove this to you like [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2237.06s)]
*  most of these people are [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2241.38s)]
*  working on [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2243.3s)]
*  Very thin incremental extensions of work that's already been done because it allows them [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2244.42s)]
*  A more defined path to get tenureship to be a well-respected professor to work through the hierarchy of a university [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2250.1800000000003s)]
*  That's what's happening today [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2256.82s)]
*  And the reason why that stuff gets funded is that those are the same people that are in charge of the funding infrastructure at nih [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2258.82s)]
*  And all these other places what we don't have [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2264.26s)]
*  Is something that says go and write the most ambitious proposals and i'm going to go fund it [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2267.62s)]
*  Yeah, I think both things are true. I'm sorry. Oh, there's no market mechanism [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2272.66s)]
*  I'll just say both things are true because what you're saying chamath is a point of failure [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2275.94s)]
*  If you say i'm going to go try something crazy like do a search for a room temperature superconductor using lead crystals [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2281.06s)]
*  You're not going to get funding for that. It's too out there [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2287.22s)]
*  I mean you guys today are talking about how low probability stuff isn't that interesting? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2290.1s)]
*  I'm not going to fund it until it's real and so when things are real [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2293.8599999999997s)]
*  You have some molecule that has some effect on cancer cells. Then you get funding to [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2297.2999999999997s)]
*  Make that molecule go to the next phase or go to the next stage [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2302.1800000000003s)]
*  That is more fundable than the outlandish crazy thing where the probability of it going to zero is 99 [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2305.06s)]
*  You could throw elizabeth holmes into that right? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2310.6600000000003s)]
*  I mean she came up with this absurd idea that she could do 200 tests on one drop of blood [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2312.6600000000003s)]
*  And they well that wasn't even pure research that that was just a statement about engineering that wasn't ready [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2317.62s)]
*  It wasn't another company. It just got funded to do the same thing that theranos promises gonna do. Yeah, do you see this? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2322.02s)]
*  But I I did not see that [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2327.7000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I mean some pretty good vcs invested in it actually and they especially said we know this is the same idea as theranos [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2329.9399999999996s)]
*  But for that very reason we think it's very unlikely to be flawed because it's being held to such a high standard of scrutiny [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2336.02s)]
*  I want you guys to think about this. I want you guys to think about this as vcs [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2341.7799999999997s)]
*  An entrepreneur comes to you and the entrepreneur she says i've done this thing. I did this thing [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2345.9399999999996s)]
*  I did this thing. I did this thing. I did this thing five different things. None of them work [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2350.66s)]
*  I want to have money to do this next thing [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2354.2599999999998s)]
*  You're less likely to fund that person than the entrepreneur that shows up and says [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2356.42s)]
*  The first thing I did work the second thing I did work the third startup. I did work. They weren't home runs [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2360.1000000000004s)]
*  But they actually have the opposite and I had good results. That's basically what happens [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2365.0600000000004s)]
*  In in you know, the scientific research is you've got to get something that's fundable [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2369.38s)]
*  And often that means not doing something that's likely to go to zero and that's where the incrementalism comes in chamath is that orientation? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2373.94s)]
*  I think that I hate to uh give my playbook [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2380.26s)]
*  But one of the great successes i've had is finding people who got their asses kicked on the last two companies [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2382.5s)]
*  Talking to them about why they got their asses kicked and then how they're going to avoid getting their asses handed to them with this third company [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2387.78s)]
*  Then if you look at travis with uber he did scour got got, you know sued for a quarter trillion dollars [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2394.66s)]
*  He did red swoosh. He got like a 30 million dollar exit and then he did uber right? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2400.5s)]
*  His first two companies were very hard steve gervitsen and future ventures [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2405.38s)]
*  He took his venture fund and he told the lps it's a 15 year term not 10 [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2409.38s)]
*  So he specifically [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2413.7000000000003s)]
*  Is trying to do a little bit of a longer window. I think that is actually a possible solution here [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2415.7000000000003s)]
*  I think smart independent thinkers find ways to make money. I've been looking at [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2420.26s)]
*  This superconductor space for the last two years [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2425.38s)]
*  And so it's not like people are are shy and have money and aren't willing to write the checks [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2428.1800000000003s)]
*  I just don't think that's what it is the body of work that's coming out of academic institutions today for the amount of money [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2433.1400000000003s)]
*  That's put in is modest and I think that's the best way to describe it [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2438.58s)]
*  it's the fairest way and the reason is modest is not because of the intellectual capacity of the people it's because of the [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2442.02s)]
*  incentives and the hierarchy and the [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2448.08s)]
*  Establishment elitist politics that [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2451.7599999999998s)]
*  Infuses how these organizations are and I think the only way to break that apart is to basically [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2454.56s)]
*  Disrupt who is in charge of these institutions nick just throw up this chart [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2461.94s)]
*  These are people that for decades and decades and decades [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2466.18s)]
*  Are in a grind and who are now in control. And so what is the incentive of these folks to explain the church? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2471.54s)]
*  Yeah, what is this? This is a chart that I put together [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2479.62s)]
*  Which is just the generational distribution of academic leadership across all the leading research institutions in america [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2481.9399999999996s)]
*  Okay, well isn't isn't falchi a prime example of this the birth year [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2488.58s)]
*  No, listen you had the most important person hold on say the most important person [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2492.7400000000002s)]
*  Probably in the federal distribution of grants in the medical field was falchi, right? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2497.5400000000004s)]
*  He literally was running the nih since the 1980s [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2502.9s)]
*  He's been there for 40 something [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2505.94s)]
*  Years [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2508.26s)]
*  And the mass was peeled away during coven and we saw how much power he wielded really I think in a corrupt way [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2509.38s)]
*  Jason used the word corrupt you had that letter to the lancet [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2515.2200000000003s)]
*  That he got a whole bunch of scientists to sign that claimed that coven was not made in a lab [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2519.14s)]
*  That was a conspiracy theory that the only place it could have come from [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2525.7s)]
*  Was the sort of the zoonotic leap naturally occurring from animals [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2530.66s)]
*  We know that he used his power over grants to basically pressure those people into signing the letter or they thought it would be in their [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2535.14s)]
*  interest to do so even though [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2542.5s)]
*  Falchi had already been updated by a bunch of scientists that it likely had come from a lab [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2545.38s)]
*  They could just look under a microscope and see them here in cleveland sites, which are the telltale sign [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2549.78s)]
*  So they knew that this thing likely came from a lab. There was no basis for calling it a conspiracy theory [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2555.3s)]
*  Certainly and yet the whole the whole field got behind that but [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2561.3s)]
*  Did you see the slack messages where they were trying to manipulate the new york times science writer? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2565.94s)]
*  I mean they basically but the question you have to ask is why were all these scientists willing to go along with this? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2570.42s)]
*  And sign that letter to the lancet because these guys have been grinding for 40 or 50 years in a hierarchy [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2575.06s)]
*  And so to all of a sudden put a pin in it and just say you know what i'm going to dispense with all of it [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2580.5s)]
*  And now i'm going to basically like be completely open-minded. How likely was that the odds of that were very low look [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2585.54s)]
*  Look at the number of people who have basically grown up in one segment of society [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2591.38s)]
*  That are sclerotically in charge of every single leading research university in the united states [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2597.46s)]
*  That is why we don't have flying cars [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2602.7400000000002s)]
*  This is why [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2605.94s)]
*  Because after 40 years of working in a specific hierarchy being rewarded in a very specific way with a very specific set of incentives [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2607.3s)]
*  When some young brash 22 year old naive person writes an extremely ambitious research proposal [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2614.1800000000003s)]
*  You're like no you will not be a part of my lab to do that [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2619.86s)]
*  But you can do this incremental thing that that further reinforces my leadership in society [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2622.6600000000003s)]
*  That is what this chart shows. Yeah, it's also perverse inside of government [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2628.58s)]
*  We didn't talk about it. I don't think last week but mitch mcconnell [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2632.1s)]
*  I don't know how to say it but I guess he froze while he was speaking and you know [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2635.06s)]
*  We gotta have an upper eight. Oh, and then the dianne feinstein thing. Remember when she started [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2638.98s)]
*  A speech and their staff are whispering saying just say I you know when she starts going on. That's like filibuster [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2644.2599999999998s)]
*  No, jc you're right [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2652.18s)]
*  We have a sclerotic political system run by octogenarians because the boomers are not [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2652.98s)]
*  Relinquishing political power fucking we're not relinquishing bureaucratic power [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2657.94s)]
*  Can we just pull up this lancet letter for a second? [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2662.2599999999998s)]
*  They say here zoom in on this the rapid open and transparent sharing of data on this outbreak is now being threatened [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2664.58s)]
*  by rumors and misinformation [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2670.74s)]
*  Around its origins. We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that covid 19 does not have a natural origin [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2673.06s)]
*  How could they say that at that point in time? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2681.06s)]
*  All the evidence suggested it was made in a lab now certainly I think you could take the other side of that but to condemn [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2684.02s)]
*  The lably theory as a conspiracy theory that was corrupt. I'm not sure that that's corrupt [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2690.5s)]
*  You know what's corrupt is not retracting that and apologizing [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2695.38s)]
*  That's where the real corruption we have not gotten our post but this lancet letter was organized. It was organized [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2699.2200000000003s)]
*  This is just like the 51 spies who lied claiming that the hunter buying laptop was disinformation [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2704.66s)]
*  This is the establishment [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2710.5s)]
*  Willing to use its credentials and respectability [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2712.98s)]
*  And expertise to sign a letter. They know is false to perpetrate a fraud [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2717.22s)]
*  On the american people in order to protect the people in charge [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2723.06s)]
*  That's the motivation here because falchi had funded gain of function research in the wuhan lab [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2727.22s)]
*  I think the same rot that is in some of these leading research institutions and leading academic institutions [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2731.94s)]
*  and politics they all share the same commonality which is [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2738.82s)]
*  We are sclerotic [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2742.5s)]
*  We are in desperate need of a generational shift of power [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2745.14s)]
*  And right now there is no incentive because at the same time, you know [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2749.06s)]
*  The people that are 70 and 80 are thinking to themselves. Well, i'll probably get to live to 100 [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2752.9s)]
*  What should I do for the next 20 years being in power is pretty good? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2756.42s)]
*  Right, so we're we're in this weird clash [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2761.06s)]
*  I was thinking a lot about [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2764.02s)]
*  The fiscal spending problem in the u.s and we should talk about the fitch rating downgrade that happened this week [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2766.02s)]
*  I've got some data i'd like to share one thing I was thinking about was how tied [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2771.14s)]
*  the age of congress is [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2776.8199999999997s)]
*  To our fiscal spending problem if you think about someone who's young they're going to want to invest for their future [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2779.22s)]
*  And think about the future if you're someone who's old you live for the day [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2785.94s)]
*  And you don't think about the future and I worry so much that the aging of the establishment that makes the decisions about how money is spent [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2790.5s)]
*  Creates a a psychological barrier [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2798.9s)]
*  Yeah, or positioning that's all about giving away all the money today [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2801.54s)]
*  Instead of making the right decision to make sure that we have a prosperous tomorrow [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2805.94s)]
*  And that's why I think so many of these things [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2811.14s)]
*  Kind of slipped through if you put a 20 year old in charge [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2814.1s)]
*  That was well informed in charge of some of the fiscal policy environmental policy energy policy decisions defense policy [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2818.1s)]
*  It would be a very different set of decision making than someone who's in their 80s inheritance tax [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2825.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2831.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean so anyway, we should talk you want to talk about the fitch downgrade because I think it's a really important story this week [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2832.74s)]
*  Fitch the rating agency [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2837.8599999999997s)]
*  downgraded the u.s's long-term debt [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2840.66s)]
*  by one notch from triple a to a a plus [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2843.14s)]
*  Only nine countries have triple a ratings from the top three rating agencies s&p global fitch and moody's [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2846.8999999999996s)]
*  Those are germany denmark netherland sweden norway switzerland luxembourg singapore and australia what you can take from that is [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2853.46s)]
*  You got to have a good balance sheet and you have to have high functioning [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2859.3799999999997s)]
*  Governments the highest functioning governments in the world are the nordics. That's why you see denmark netherland sweden norway there [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2863.54s)]
*  According to npr the negative reaction hasn't been as strong as uh, 2011 [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2870.42s)]
*  That was the first time the u.s was downgraded from triple a to a a plus by the s&p [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2875.2999999999997s)]
*  That also had to do with the debt ceiling the markets kind of shrugged off [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2880.1800000000003s)]
*  Largely shrugged off the fitch downgrade main reasons for the downgrade [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2883.94s)]
*  is obviously [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2888.26s)]
*  Higher interest rates aging population the debt to gdp ratio, which we've talked about here [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2890.42s)]
*  But government kept coming up [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2895.46s)]
*  Over and over again and how dysfunctional our government is and the debt ceiling is one of the key manifestations of that [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2898.1000000000004s)]
*  Your thoughts on this for the first half of the show freeberg you're an optimist [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2905.46s)]
*  But are you now going to switch to the finest? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2911.46s)]
*  I wouldn't say the finest are you going to switch to the finest mode now or are you still in optimist mode? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2914.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean in jacob's view unless you're a cheerleader for every stupid government policy [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2919.54s)]
*  You're a decline list. I know it's it's it jacob. Listen it [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2924.1000000000004s)]
*  I want to be honest. I I don't think so. I think he like [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2929.38s)]
*  And I I concur I think you can highlight that there are concerns with us fiscal policy [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2933.06s)]
*  That are putting us in decline in our spending spiral [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2939.2200000000003s)]
*  With the us currency reserves, which there are now diversification efforts underway and i'll talk about this in one second [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2942.02s)]
*  And that doesn't mean that the us isn't the most exceptional place to do engineering and entrepreneurism [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2948.66s)]
*  And have freedom of speech and thought and so on but there are elements of the us that put things at risk [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2954.1800000000003s)]
*  So let me just point out these two charts if you guys pull the first one up [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2958.74s)]
*  This is a pretty striking chart and I think I showed this before this is federal government interest payments that are being made [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2961.54s)]
*  We're we're now up to you know, a trillion dollars [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2967.7s)]
*  The chart as you can see a year has spiked and by the way that number is spiking further and we'll talk about this in one second [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2971.54s)]
*  As a result of rising interest rates and increased fiscal spending. So this is now becoming a pretty sizable part of our budget and as of now [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2977.22s)]
*  paying the interest on our debt [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2984.5s)]
*  Is a larger capital outlay for the federal government than defense spending the second chart shows what happened in the last week [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2986.66s)]
*  Which is that 30-year treasuries have been sold off and as that's happened treasury yields have climbed [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2992.58s)]
*  So there's been about a 10 decline in pricing and a you know, concurrent nearly 10 increase and bill acman [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=2998.02s)]
*  You know basically said today that he's shorting 30-year treasuries. He thinks we're going to go to five and a half percent [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3004.58s)]
*  Long-term rates currently the 30-year treasury sitting at 4.3 and remember I told you guys this after this thing [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3009.62s)]
*  I went to a few weeks ago [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3014.82s)]
*  that [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3016.5800000000004s)]
*  There were two prominent economists who shared [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3018.5800000000004s)]
*  That they think we're going to be facing long-term rates in the five to seven percent range very long-term rates for a very long period [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3021.2200000000003s)]
*  of time [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3027.3s)]
*  That it is a new fiscal regime [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3028.26s)]
*  And then if you pull up the last link I sent nick [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3030.5800000000004s)]
*  This is a report made by the treasury borrowing advisory committee of the treasury department [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3032.98s)]
*  And I just want to read a couple of quotes from this report [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3039.3s)]
*  This just came out today and it was published it was sent over to the secretary of the treasury yesterday [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3041.46s)]
*  And it said since the advisory committee convened in may two-year treasury yields are about 100 basis points higher [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3046.42s)]
*  While 10-year treasuries have increased by about 40 basis points [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3052.58s)]
*  The bank holdings of non-mortgage-backed government securities, mainly treasuries have actually declined [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3055.54s)]
*  By 146 billion so far this year. So that means banks are selling off their treasuries [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3061.94s)]
*  The committee goes on to say at the same time [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3066.34s)]
*  Treasury investors have noted that treasury supply will need to increase to address the rise in public deficits [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3068.82s)]
*  As tax revenues have come in weaker and government spending has increased [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3075.1400000000003s)]
*  Issue its needs will be additionally impacted by the timing of a recession. So then they said [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3079.6200000000003s)]
*  Based on the marketable borrowing estimates published on july 31st treasury. This is crazy treasury currently expects [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3083.94s)]
*  privately held net borrowing of [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3090.96s)]
*  1.007 trillion dollars in this quarter [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3095.1200000000003s)]
*  With an assumed end of september cash balance of 650 and then they said we expect [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3098.1s)]
*  another [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3103.54s)]
*  852 billion dollars of borrowing next quarter. That means treasury is going to try and issue and sell [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3104.96s)]
*  two trillion dollars worth of treasury bonds [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3110.98s)]
*  In the next two quarters, that's two trillion dollars of new borrowing by the federal government to pay our bills [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3114.58s)]
*  At the start of the year, they were estimating 1.6 trillion for the year, which was an insane number [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3120.26s)]
*  Now we're talking about two trillion in just two quarters [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3124.98s)]
*  So rates are climbing as a result. We need to borrow more and this is a perfect manifestation of the debt spiral problem [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3127.62s)]
*  That we've talked about multiple times our fiscal spending outlay and the rising interest rates [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3134.5s)]
*  Combine to create an insurmountable debt spiral that is now manifesting in the fact that we need to sell two trillion dollars [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3140.0s)]
*  of um [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3147.3799999999997s)]
*  Treasuries and here's the crazy statistic that they said in reviewing recent demand for us treasuries in auctions [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3148.5s)]
*  The committee noted that an increasing percentage of supply is being absorbed by investment funds [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3155.38s)]
*  While foreign participation has remained range-bound. That means as we're trying to sell more treasuries governments [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3159.86s)]
*  Foreign governments are buying fewer of them [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3165.22s)]
*  Which means that the us currency as a reserve is no longer the place that everyone wants to plow their money as much as it [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3166.9s)]
*  Used to be it is in decline [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3172.42s)]
*  Now the other thing I want to share which I think is is absolutely critical [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3175.14s)]
*  Is how do we address this gap? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3179.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, the one way is these entitlement programs and so several republican presidential candidates nicky hailey ron desantis and mike pence [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3181.54s)]
*  have all publicly stated on the [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3188.66s)]
*  The campaign trail that they're promoting programs to cut social security benefits for people that are 30 and 40 years old [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3190.9s)]
*  And here's the response to that [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3198.1s)]
*  So so they've gone out and they've started saying that [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3200.7400000000002s)]
*  A poll was done and on that poll 82 percent of voters [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3203.7s)]
*  Oppose the push to cut social security for americans under 50 82 percent [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3208.8199999999997s)]
*  So where is this going to take us? This is what is so scary to me jay cal [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3215.06s)]
*  I'm not an american declineist. I believe in the american system. It benefited me and my family [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3218.8199999999997s)]
*  But I do worry that we find ourselves in a whirlpool that it's very hard to get out of because the populace [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3224.18s)]
*  Says we don't want to make the cuts that are necessary in order for us to save ourselves [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3230.58s)]
*  That's what's so scary to me and I said it before I think it's worth saying again. That's it [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3234.5s)]
*  I'm done. It's not a problem with populism. I mean the elites are saying it too [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3239.14s)]
*  There's no appetite in the dnc to cut a reform social security. You're kidding. It's very unpopular. How do you get how do you get elected? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3242.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't know why those republicans get elected saying I hadn't seen that article [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3249.62s)]
*  I would advise all those campaigns not to touch that rail. They're going to electrocute themselves [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3253.3799999999997s)]
*  I think trump has the right political instincts on this point, which is you cannot [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3257.94s)]
*  touch social security [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3262.58s)]
*  As a single-party effort it has to be bipartisan and there is no bipartisan will to do anything [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3264.26s)]
*  So I think you're you're right about the larger point chamath your thoughts on freedberg's manifesto that [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3269.3s)]
*  80 of the public does not want to cut spending they're in favor [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3276.34s)]
*  Of social security for people under 50 years old and we have a trillion dollars in debt payments and we're in a death spiral [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3280.26s)]
*  Because we're borrowing two trillion in 180 days. We're borrowing an extra two trillion [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3285.86s)]
*  That's the real point the the end [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3290.1800000000003s)]
*  The fiscal end of days or at the start at the start of the year the the expectation was there [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3293.0600000000004s)]
*  We're only going to borrow 1.6 trillion for the year now. We're borrowing two trillion in just these two quarters [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3297.94s)]
*  Let me just state what I think about the don great. It's irrelevant [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3302.7400000000002s)]
*  The s&p did it 13 years ago fitch is a [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3307.1400000000003s)]
*  Marginal credit rating agency there at a minimum 13 years late at a maximum [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3310.48s)]
*  They're just anxiety wouldn't like other people are [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3315.78s)]
*  Screaming that the sky's driving. So that's my first point [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3319.38s)]
*  The second point and the more important one is that I none of you who are always freaking out about this understand [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3322.6600000000003s)]
*  This conversation about relativism all of these conversations are relatively and deal with them in absolutes [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3330.82s)]
*  On a relative basis japan's debt to gdp is 270 percent and growing [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3337.86s)]
*  On a relative basis our debt to gdp is half of that [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3342.82s)]
*  We are the most important economic force in the world [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3346.7400000000002s)]
*  It is going to continue to be the most economic force in the world and all I see actually on every single monetary basis [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3350.9s)]
*  Is every other country struggling more than we are so [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3357.7000000000003s)]
*  my question to all of the chicken littles is [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3360.6600000000003s)]
*  What do you do if you're a central government? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3364.42s)]
*  Where you have to have foreign reserves? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3367.46s)]
*  Do you all of a sudden double down on the euro? [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3370.82s)]
*  Do you double down in the yuan which is basically a proxy for being for doubling down in the us dollar [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3373.62s)]
*  What are you supposed to do and I never get a good answer because on a relative basis the us will still continue to do [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3379.3799999999997s)]
*  Well, I think that debt to gdp [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3384.5s)]
*  Is a red herring for a lot of people [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3387.22s)]
*  And I think that the way that people run their personal lives, which should take income to debt into [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3389.7799999999997s)]
*  Consideration I don't think applies as much to governments and I think these things are going to march forward as a group [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3395.8399999999997s)]
*  There's not going to be a single g8 country that all of a sudden moves away and starts printing surpluses [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3403.22s)]
*  It happened almost as an accident an aberration during the clinton administration. It'll never happen again [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3408.9s)]
*  And I think that we shouldn't worry so much [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3415.22s)]
*  Because I just don't see an alternative [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3417.8599999999997s)]
*  So give me instead of telling me how bad this is because you think about your own life and how it would be bad if you had [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3419.7799999999997s)]
*  Debt to gdp of a hundred I get it [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3425.14s)]
*  As a country give me the alternative country [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3427.62s)]
*  But just start with that can you answer that question what is the alternative country? Yeah, where would you put your your wealth if not the dollar? [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3431.06s)]
*  Well, let me paint a scenario that's not as dire as a collapse of the u.s. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3439.62s)]
*  Dollars the world's reserve currency. Okay, so on this fit, right? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3445.3s)]
*  That's not what I think happens, right? I think this is just purchasing power goes down. That's it. But go ahead sex relative to who? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3449.14s)]
*  Be specific anyone [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3455.86s)]
*  But what does that what does that mean relative to anyone let me paint like a non-catastrophic scenario or non-apocalyptic scenario [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3457.78s)]
*  Which is what you saw in this fitch ratings downgrade [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3463.7000000000003s)]
*  Is that the bond market did move at the margins? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3467.1400000000003s)]
*  There was a sell-off in the 10 year and as a result the 10 year bond yield moved up to 4.2 percent [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3469.86s)]
*  So it wasn't a case of everybody shedding all of their u.s. Treasuries. It's just that there were [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3475.78s)]
*  Market actors at the margins who adjusted their portfolios [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3482.02s)]
*  Okay now freeberg is saying that the treasury is going to have to do another [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3485.6200000000003s)]
*  Two trillion dollar bond offering and we have trillion dollar plus deficits as far as the eye can see [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3489.3s)]
*  And we've got entitlement [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3494.9s)]
*  Liabilities on the horizon and then a political unwillingness to do anything about it [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3496.96s)]
*  So the deficits are only going to get bigger and bigger now. What does that do? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3501.0600000000004s)]
*  It's supply and demand when the u.s. Treasury needs to keep issuing more and more bonds at some point the demand for those things [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3504.26s)]
*  gets incrementally [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3511.6200000000003s)]
*  Saturated and they have to offer a higher yield [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3513.12s)]
*  So what happens? Well, the bond rates go up and so the 10 year goes up [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3516.64s)]
*  Like freeberg was saying from 4.2 to somewhere in the five to seven percent range [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3521.2s)]
*  And that doesn't mean that us dollar is not the world's reserve currency. It just means that it gets incrementally [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3525.68s)]
*  Harder and more expensive to keep financing our debt. Now, what is the result of that? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3531.52s)]
*  Well, if I as an investor could theoretically get seven percent [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3535.8399999999997s)]
*  From the u.s. Treasury as the risk-free rate [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3540.96s)]
*  Why would I want to take equity risk and put it in the stock market? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3542.96s)]
*  Which historically has yielded somewhere in the five to seven percent range. So if I can get my five to seven percent [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3546.6400000000003s)]
*  From a risk-free u.s. Government bond, of course i'm going to do that. So the discount rate on equities will go up [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3552.0s)]
*  That means that the stock market relatively on a relative basis will go down risk capital will go down [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3559.28s)]
*  It will be less risk capital and they'll be way less risk capital available for things like venture capital and private equity [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3564.96s)]
*  Does risk taking of all kinds? [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3571.1200000000003s)]
*  And so the economy will just grow slower. It's not like there'll be a collapse. It'll just be this huge albatross [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3573.28s)]
*  Yeah around the neck of the private sector and this is called crowding out. Here's the may I give a counter here? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3579.28s)]
*  I think if you look at the amount of sovereign wealth funds and the investment coming from around the world into u.s [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3585.04s)]
*  Venture capital that will keep the venture machine [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3591.28s)]
*  Cranking here in america, but three charts to just look at here nick pull up the first one the 30-year fed [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3595.1000000000004s)]
*  So to counter this argument really the aberration has been 2010 to 2020 when we had [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3600.1600000000003s)]
*  You know low single-digit mortgages three percent four percent [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3607.52s)]
*  The majority of our lifetime it was between five and ten and if it's six up in the five to ten [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3611.52s)]
*  Basis that that's what we experience for most of our life and then the second chart [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3616.32s)]
*  This is the lowest unemployment we've had in our lifetimes [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3619.68s)]
*  If you look at the unemployment rate in the united states 3.6 is [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3623.2s)]
*  Unbelievable and then combined with it something we've talked about here for two years that we can't understand [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3627.58s)]
*  Is when do all these jobs burn off we peaked, you know during the post covid era at about 11 million job openings [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3631.7599999999998s)]
*  And then you know, we're still over nine [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3639.04s)]
*  So for there's two or three job openings for every american who wants to work [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3641.36s)]
*  And we've shut down the borders largely even though we have some illegal immigration coming in [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3645.8399999999997s)]
*  It is basically shut down the united states to immigration. It's about a third of what it was [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3650.16s)]
*  Before trump and biden decided to shut things down. I don't think we're looking at the same video that that i'm seeing [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3654.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, if you're looking at videos, those are very distracting [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3660.3199999999997s)]
*  I would encourage you to look at the numbers of the actual migration into the country [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3662.4s)]
*  It's a third of what it was to see what's happening in new york city. They got lines around the blocks caught up in clips [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3665.92s)]
*  On from the border, I would just look at the raw numbers sax and the raw numbers show the wrong numbers [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3672.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, because we count them and we can't we count the other you have to estimate them because they're illegal [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3678.0s)]
*  But they got seven million in the last two and a half years the numbers and the actual statistics than anecdotal videos [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3682.16s)]
*  Because both sides will manipulate the heck out of them for their own purposes [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3687.8399999999997s)]
*  But the fact is america is just crushing it in terms of employment [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3691.52s)]
*  And that's why we didn't have this crash landing in the and I think the soft landing is because of employment [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3694.88s)]
*  And i'll just end there and if we can keep ourselves employed and everybody from the middle east to japan [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3700.96s)]
*  To high net worth individuals in europe are pouring their money into the u.s venture ecosystem [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3708.0s)]
*  I think the setup here is we got to control spending as you've said correctly freeburg [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3712.56s)]
*  We get a little bit of control on spending hopefully [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3716.7999999999997s)]
*  And then we are going to have to slowly burn off some of this [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3720.08s)]
*  You know debt we can't live with this kind of debt payments. Here's a little data for you. This is from [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3723.44s)]
*  Congressional research service off of fed data [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3729.6s)]
*  So foreign holdings of u.s treasuries have declined [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3732.32s)]
*  From 40 to 30 percent of total treasuries 70 of treasuries today are held by domestic investors [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3735.44s)]
*  This is the data that was being described [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3741.68s)]
*  In the treasury advisory committee the borrowing advisory committee a letter that I just said is that they're seeing less demand [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3744.56s)]
*  From foreign buyers of treasuries now I I can argue we can argue theoretically about what else are they going to buy? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3751.28s)]
*  What else are they doing with their money? I don't know [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3756.0s)]
*  But the the data is showing a decline in purchasing intention by foreign buyers of u.s treasuries [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3758.0s)]
*  And we're having to pick up the slack through investment funds held by the u.s mostly pension mostly retirement funds [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3764.72s)]
*  I would guess that are buying these treasuries. That is not what this chart shows the chart shows the effect of quantitative easing [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3770.88s)]
*  That's what this chart shows because when you're buying treasuries from the market and retiring them [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3776.8s)]
*  Of course the percentage of foreign and domestic holdings of publicly held debt is going to go down [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3781.52s)]
*  So this last period explain this x of qe explain it sorry [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3786.4s)]
*  I don't understand what you're saying [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3789.92s)]
*  This is a measurement of the amount of people that own treasuries. Is that right domestic versus foreign? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3791.28s)]
*  Yeah, so who who owns so as of december 22 there was um 24 billion [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3797.68s)]
*  I'm i'm going to assume because this chart is fucking worthless if this if it doesn't assume [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3803.12s)]
*  That the domestic holding the gray bar that adds up to 100 doesn't include the fed which it must [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3807.2000000000003s)]
*  And that is because the fed has been buying treasuries from the market [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3812.96s)]
*  Okay, so just let me just give you the numbers for a second and then we can [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3817.36s)]
*  Take out. No, no, i'm just looking at the chart. The chart is a great bar. That says domestic holdings [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3820.72s)]
*  I'm gonna give you there's an orange bar. That says foreign holdings. You've had 10 years of the fed buying [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3825.52s)]
*  Treasuries i'm gonna give you the numbers. There are 24 trillion dollars [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3832.62s)]
*  of treasuries publicly held treasuries outstanding [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3837.12s)]
*  7.4 trillion held in foreign hands the foreign holding [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3840.8s)]
*  Of publicly held debt between december of 18 and december 22 increased from 6.3 trillion to 7.4 trillion [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3846.32s)]
*  While other investors increased from 16 trillion to probably 23 trillion [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3853.76s)]
*  So, you know, it's we're having to pick up the slack investment funds private investors are having to pick up the slack [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3858.56s)]
*  Because of foreign demand for treasuries lagging at this point that that's the point of the chart [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3864.32s)]
*  I don't know what I don't know what to tell you [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3868.56s)]
*  I think what this chart tells me is that the balance sheet of domestic holdings grows goes because the fed has been buying treasuries [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3869.92s)]
*  and in a in a world of qt [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3875.84s)]
*  I suspect that this bar chart will change in the next 10 years if you look at the histogram 10 years from now [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3878.56s)]
*  If you assume that qt sticks around [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3883.2000000000003s)]
*  So, I don't know you can interpret whatever you want to feed your anxiety. It doesn't change that [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3885.28s)]
*  There's a relative problem at hand, which is you cannot sell one thing without buying another [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3889.84s)]
*  That's just the way it works in financial markets [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3895.44s)]
*  The federal reserve during that same time period increased their treasury holdings. Here's the exact numbers [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3898.6400000000003s)]
*  From nine three point seven trillion to nine point seven trillion [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3904.0s)]
*  So they bought six trillion of that debt [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3906.88s)]
*  I think the fact that we're going to go from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening over the next decade is another overhang [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3908.56s)]
*  Because not hold on a second because not only does the u.s. Government need to sell another two trillion [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3914.2400000000002s)]
*  of [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3919.76s)]
*  Bonds every year to finance its deficit, which is basically the addition to the debt. You've got the fed now [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3920.56s)]
*  Shedding what like eight trillion? [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3927.12s)]
*  They're just letting them roll off they're letting them roll off and they're not reissuing them [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3931.36s)]
*  But you actually said the right thing earlier [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3934.88s)]
*  Which is that the risk premium has been shrunk so massively between equities and bonds [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3937.2799999999997s)]
*  these two trillion of bonds that these guys will issue back between [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3942.4s)]
*  the strip will [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3946.96s)]
*  Trade from five percent all the way down to three. There'll be a line [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3948.4s)]
*  Out the door, I guarantee you [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3952.64s)]
*  And the reason why is exactly what you said before david, which is like why not own five percent paper from the u.s. Government? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3954.88s)]
*  Versus having to like all of a sudden speculate on the sb 500 or something else [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3960.2400000000002s)]
*  It's a no-brainer and I totally agree with you [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3963.6800000000003s)]
*  But that this last two trillion that'll be the easiest two trillion to sell there will be a line out the door [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3965.76s)]
*  Guaranteed well, there's a line out the door at some price [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3971.36s)]
*  So my point is that the yield will have to go up to attract those incremental buyers and as the supply [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3974.64s)]
*  Of t bills becomes a glut [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3981.52s)]
*  Obviously, they're gonna have to make the yield more attractive in order to keep [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3983.98s)]
*  Attracting that marginal buyer. It's just that simple. So yeah at some price they'll be able to find a buyer [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3988.7999999999997s)]
*  But that yield will have to get higher and higher over time and then that crowds out private investment [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=3995.52s)]
*  Because why in the world would you invest in a risky stock when you get seven percent risk free? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4000.48s)]
*  What's your alternative? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4004.48s)]
*  Because again, like what do you think the spread to jgbs is going to be if that's true if if u.s [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4005.52s)]
*  Treasuries, okay if 30 your treasuries are all of a sudden in five and a half of bill ackman's right [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4010.24s)]
*  Which you could very well be the other part of what he's not saying is what do jgbs look like? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4014.4s)]
*  What do european bonds look like? You know what they're going to be they're going to be [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4017.84s)]
*  Trading at 300 to 500 basis points above that [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4021.92s)]
*  It is cataclysmic for the entire world economy and so we all move in unison [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4025.6s)]
*  When we suffer we will suffer less than other countries and when we win [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4030.08s)]
*  We will generally win more than other countries that has typically been true. I suspect it will typically be true [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4033.6s)]
*  And I don't see anything changing that hold on. Let's assume that you're right [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4039.52s)]
*  And what happens is that though? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4042.2400000000002s)]
*  Let's call it the western world and all these governments are basically mired in debts with a few exceptions. I guess [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4043.6s)]
*  Australia is good switzerland's good, but the rest have massive debt to gdp as well [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4049.44s)]
*  So their bonds have to move up with ours [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4054.2400000000002s)]
*  And so their risk premium has to go up as well. So you're right in lockstep with the us [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4057.0400000000004s)]
*  But now why wouldn't global growth just slow down? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4061.92s)]
*  Across let's call it this whole western dollar complex coupled with inflation coupled with inflation, right? [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4065.76s)]
*  Which is inevitable. That's basically what's happened in japan, right? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4071.92s)]
*  Is that they have like a 200 debt to gdp and they've been very active in yield curve control [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4074.7200000000003s)]
*  And so they've controlled the interest rates, but the price of that's been total [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4080.72s)]
*  Which is the population it's they have demographic problems as well, but that's the main issue there is young people there [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4085.12s)]
*  There's just not a lot of young people there. I mean their housing is crazy [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4090.96s)]
*  If you just look at it, and I think the united states has a lot of innovation. So [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4095.6s)]
*  We will innovate our way out of it is is my belief which is kind of what we know is so exciting guys [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4100.16s)]
*  We can have this conversation with larry summers himself at the all-in summer [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4104.96s)]
*  There you go number wait, do we have ray dalio to us? [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4109.04s)]
*  We have ray dalio. Yeah, are they gonna be on a panel together? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4111.92s)]
*  Are we really interesting to discuss this topic with the two of them? Maybe overlap look at the schedule everyone [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4114.320000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, all our speakers are in tight schedules on when they're in and out, which is why I need jcal to respond to my [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4119.1s)]
*  I am to him about [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4125.360000000001s)]
*  finalizing some of our other speakers, but [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4127.04s)]
*  Hey, jimmy texted me because I could probably he's in like london or yesterday in london. We gotta figure out how to get him back [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4129.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4134.240000000001s)]
*  He said he'd fly out but we got to figure out how to do that [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4135.52s)]
*  But yeah, we can have this conversation in la september 10 through 12. Oh, well, it's sold out [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4137.4400000000005s)]
*  So way to frustrate everybody i'm getting like [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4142.0s)]
*  All kinds of like lps and giant folks who are like can I buy a vip ticket and i'm like listen [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4145.120000000001s)]
*  It's sold out. You had two months to do that. So in other news [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4150.240000000001s)]
*  The gop's lead candidate for [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4155.040000000001s)]
*  The 2024 race donald trump has been indicted for trying to overturn the 2020 election [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4159.280000000001s)]
*  And stop the peaceful transfer of power the indictment has four counts [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4165.68s)]
*  And is the third criminal case for those of you playing along at home four counts include [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4170.0s)]
*  Conspiracy to defraud the u.s conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding obstruction of an attempt to obstruct an official proceeding conspiracy against [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4175.580000000001s)]
*  Rights trump campaign [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4185.68s)]
*  Not shockingly called it fake news [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4187.84s)]
*  The indictment feels like it's got him dead to rights [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4190.160000000001s)]
*  And this is on top of the oath [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4193.84s)]
*  Keepers founder suet rhodes getting 18 years and a bunch of other cases in addition to that [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4196.32s)]
*  The doga prosecutors also accused trump of ordering employees to delete security videos [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4202.24s)]
*  And the classified documents case the cover-up of course being worse than the crime [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4208.4800000000005s)]
*  Looks like they got him dead to rights on that one as well [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4213.04s)]
*  All of this against the backdrop of desantis spending tens of millions of dollars and falling [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4216.4800000000005s)]
*  in his percentage [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4223.12s)]
*  sax explained to the audience why this is hunter biden's fault and uh, that's a deep spate conspiracy [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4225.4400000000005s)]
*  I kid [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4231.6s)]
*  What are your thoughts on this when you say they have him dead to rights? Like what do you mean by that? [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4232.56s)]
*  What's your basis for saying exactly what do you dead to rights on what charge? [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4237.76s)]
*  Yeah, so in this indictment the 45 pages, uh, if you read it [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4242.16s)]
*  You will see that they put up fake [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4247.52s)]
*  Electrodes and they knew that it wasn't going to work and they did it anyway after losing 60 cases. So [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4249.92s)]
*  that's the [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4258.240000000001s)]
*  Belief of why this is such a serious case [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4260.0s)]
*  And then also the cover-up [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4262.8s)]
*  obstructing justice and it looks like [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4264.8s)]
*  Some of these maintenance workers are potentially flipping and mark meadows [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4266.8s)]
*  They claim has flipped as well. So but you know, hey listen everybody [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4271.120000000001s)]
*  The most cases is sort of separate. I mean, I think we should just stick to this the big news here [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4274.400000000001s)]
*  What do you think of the fact that he tried this allegation that he tried to delete the videos? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4279.44s)]
*  Do you think it's real or do you think it's made up? I don't know that that's a that's a detail about a piece of evidence [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4283.2s)]
*  In that case. I do think the documents case [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4288.16s)]
*  is [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4291.12s)]
*  on a sounder legal footing [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4292.4s)]
*  Than the jr. 6 case you're saying more dangerous too. It doesn't involve as many novel legal theories [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4295.599999999999s)]
*  Now is it really dangerous? [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4301.44s)]
*  I think the american people think that at the end of the day that documents case is sort of a paperwork case [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4302.639999999999s)]
*  And there are many other people who violated the classified requirements [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4308.320000000001s)]
*  Rules like sandy burger like david petraeus like hillary clinton never prosecuted [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4312.64s)]
*  So I think if they have him dead to rights on any of the cases is the documents case [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4317.200000000001s)]
*  But I also think that in the minds of the american people [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4321.92s)]
*  That in the minds of the american people feels like dc inside baseball now, I think on this jr. 6 case [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4324.88s)]
*  About the documents case. What do you personally think? I think if you're going to prosecute trump for that [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4331.68s)]
*  You need to prosecute all these other people who violated classified documents rules [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4335.12s)]
*  What do you think about him sandy burger who worked for clinton? [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4338.96s)]
*  Was a national security advisor stuffed his pants [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4343.28s)]
*  Yeah with classified documents from one of those clean rooms [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4346.32s)]
*  And got away with a slap on the wrist. What do you think about trying to overturn the election? [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4350.48s)]
*  Well, look do you think he tried to overturn the election? I mean just a basic fact [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4355.12s)]
*  Let me state right away that I think that what trump did in the wake of the 2020 election was indefensible [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4358.96s)]
*  I said so at the time. I said that I did say it what I said is that once the stream court [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4366.400000000001s)]
*  Once the courts in general throughout his case and once the stream court denied certiorari [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4371.6s)]
*  It was time for him to stop and he kept going [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4376.320000000001s)]
*  It was time for him to stop and he did it and so I think that his actions were indefensible. However [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4379.6s)]
*  When you're talking about criminal prosecutions, they can't just be an expression [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4384.24s)]
*  of condemnation [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4388.419999999999s)]
*  You actually have to prove that somebody engaged your criminal behavior and the issue here [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4390.0199999999995s)]
*  With this january 6th case [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4395.46s)]
*  Is that it relies on novel legal theories? [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4397.54s)]
*  There's actually a really good article in the new york times of all places explaining this [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4400.74s)]
*  Do you think there was a possibility that he if he could have he would have turned over? [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4404.58s)]
*  The election if pence had gone along with it. All right, you're you're getting into a bunch of hypotheticals here [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4410.74s)]
*  The question is whether these charges will actually stand up to scrutiny. Let me read you [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4415.38s)]
*  What david leonhardt from the new york times reported? [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4421.700000000001s)]
*  Because I actually think when you have the new york times saying that the case is weak. I think it's really indicative. So [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4424.9800000000005s)]
*  what [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4430.1s)]
*  The new york times says or leonhardt says as shocking as it was trump's behavior on january 6th did not violate [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4431.06s)]
*  Any laws in obvious ways? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4436.9800000000005s)]
*  He never directly told those the january 6 rally to attack congress during his speech that day [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4438.9800000000005s)]
*  He even said he knew that protesters would behave peacefully and patriotically [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4443.38s)]
*  It was part of a long-standing trump pattern in which as my colleague maggie [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4447.54s)]
*  Haverman puts it quote. He is often both all over the place and yet someone careful not to cross certain lines end quote [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4451.14s)]
*  As for trump's broader effort to overturn the election result. No federal law specifically bars politicians from attempting to do so [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4457.06s)]
*  Without such a law smith has relied on a novel approach. He has charged trump with committing criminal fraud [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4464.58s)]
*  And violating conspiracy laws that were not written to prevent the overturning of election result [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4471.139999999999s)]
*  And then he says that a key part of these laws they revolve around a person's intent [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4476.0199999999995s)]
*  Intend his court to the notion of fraud only if someone is knowingly [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4479.94s)]
*  Trying to deceive others can he be committing a fraud and he says that's why the case seems like they revolve around trump's state [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4483.46s)]
*  Of mind so the problem with this is they have to not only prove [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4488.26s)]
*  That what trump did in the wake of the election was indefensible and outrageous and all the things that you believe they have to [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4491.7s)]
*  Prove that trump knew [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4498.66s)]
*  That he lost the election and knowingly perpetrated the fraud and I don't think you'll be able to ever prove that beyond a reasonable doubt [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4500.74s)]
*  But even though yes, there are statements that they point to yeah [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4506.5s)]
*  They got all those statements and then bill bar mark meadows. Everybody's on him pence has flipped on them [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4509.38s)]
*  They're all flipped on them. They have statements by those people. Yes, but trump also had this whack pack of lawyers [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4515.38s)]
*  So you had juliani and you had [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4521.0599999999995s)]
*  sydney powell [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4523.94s)]
*  And john eastman and michael indel the pillow guy they were all in the white house telling trump [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4525.3s)]
*  That listen you won the election you've been robbed and there are valid legal grounds for you to contest this and trump for years [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4530.42s)]
*  Has been maintaining the stolen election narrative even when his advisors have told him this is not good for you [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4536.34s)]
*  The the guy has stolen election on the brain. Okay every [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4542.42s)]
*  Interview he's brought this up even when it's manifestly harmful to himself and the republican party [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4545.4400000000005s)]
*  So this idea that you can prove that he doesn't really believe the election was stolen [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4551.38s)]
*  The one thing I believe about trump is that he really does believe the election was stolen [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4556.82s)]
*  And I think you will never be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is knowingly lying about that [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4561.14s)]
*  And as a result of this you can never prove this case [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4566.9s)]
*  Now it also relies on this novel theory. They are turning the civil rights law into a pretzel to try and figure out a way [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4570.1s)]
*  to indict [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4577.7s)]
*  Trump or prosecute him under this novel legal theory of committing quote fraud against the american people [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4579.46s)]
*  Okay, this is a novel legal theory that's never been tried before and by the way if you're going to create that as a precedent [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4585.54s)]
*  I hope we're going to go after those [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4592.820000000001s)]
*  Those signers of the lancer letter we talked about because they committed a fraud against american people [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4595.22s)]
*  I hope that we will prosecute the 51 spies who lied because they perpetrated fraud against american people [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4599.860000000001s)]
*  I hope also and I hope we will go after the authors of that steel dossier [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4605.46s)]
*  Because they perpetrated a fraud of the american people [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4610.42s)]
*  There's a lot of people in washington who've perpetrated a fraud on the american people [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4612.1s)]
*  I hope we're going to go after all of them [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4615.38s)]
*  But my point is this it's not the job of a prosecutor to be creative with the law ever [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4616.740000000001s)]
*  I mean they are supposed to apply the law strictly as written. They're supposed to bring cases that are open and shut [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4621.620000000001s)]
*  and what [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4628.34s)]
*  jacksmith is doing here is going for this bank shot where [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4629.860000000001s)]
*  He wants to charge trump with incitement, but he knows he can't win that case [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4633.3s)]
*  So he's going for this back door of civil rights law to sidestep the first amendment problem [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4637.94s)]
*  And it might be this is an abuse of prosecutorial power and once you let prosecutors get creative like this [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4642.9s)]
*  You're on a slippery slope to show me the man i'll show you the crime as in stalin's russia [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4649.139999999999s)]
*  So listen, I believe that again trump's actions were illegitimate and outrageous [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4652.98s)]
*  But again, the purpose of criminal law is not to express disapproval. You have to be able to prove [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4658.339999999999s)]
*  These cases in an open and shut way without novel legal theories [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4663.54s)]
*  I just want to say I need to give I need to give sacks a 10 out of 10 for this last piece. That was [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4666.66s)]
*  Excellent. Absolutely. Excellent. Jason. Here's the question. I ask you good. Do you believe that trump was guilty of inciting an insurrection? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4671.7s)]
*  Absolutely. Yeah when he told those people to yeah when he told those people to go down [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4678.26s)]
*  Why hasn't jack smith indicted trump they've indicted trump on all these different charges with over 500 years of jail time [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4684.42s)]
*  And they have not indicted him for incitement. Why not? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4691.38s)]
*  They they could always add to the charges and so I suspect when they start flipping people they will but you know [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4693.94s)]
*  It's kind of no [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4698.66s)]
*  To have this discussion. We should move on to the next one. No, hold on. Hold on [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4699.94s)]
*  Let me finish you ask me a question. Here's the thing. You know what 30 percent of people? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4703.06s)]
*  In the republican party about 30 percent of this country have trump stockholm syndrome [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4706.82s)]
*  They cannot let go of trump and so there's no reason to debate it with the gop [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4711.06s)]
*  They have tss and it you're going to defend him to the dying day. You're going to do what about isms [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4715.06s)]
*  The republican party will never accept the fact that this person's a criminal [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4721.7s)]
*  He's corrupt and he's a horrible human being and he is not fit to serve and you're going to serve him up as your candidate [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4725.860000000001s)]
*  It's disgraceful. The gop is a disaster for for actually supporting him [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4731.78s)]
*  Guy has no morality and he would have overturned the government if he had the chance and he will do it again [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4737.3s)]
*  Can I respond to this? I'll give a couple different points here. All right, so look as many points as you want [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4742.1s)]
*  There are people who are absolutely fixated [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4746.18s)]
*  On january 6 and it's the people who've been trying to whip this up and make it into [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4749.22s)]
*  A crime and invent all these novel legal charges and haven't stopped talking about for the last two and a half years [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4753.78s)]
*  I'm so sick of talking about this whole january 6 thing. I don't want this to be our politics. Okay [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4758.18s)]
*  The people who've made it our politics [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4764.02s)]
*  Include the the mainstream media. It's all the people on cnn. Ms. Mbc won't stop talking about it and part of the reason why [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4766.66s)]
*  I think trump likely will be the nominee is because they are creating a backlash [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4773.78s)]
*  In the gop where people basically think that he's being unfairly prosecuted and persecuted now to my question [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4779.0599999999995s)]
*  Why aren't they charging him with incitement? [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4785.0599999999995s)]
*  That is the crime that the media says he has committed for the last two and a half years [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4787.38s)]
*  So why aren't they charging him because the doj looked at that at the beginning? [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4792.099999999999s)]
*  of 2021 [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4796.66s)]
*  Merrick garland's doj looked at that and they did a report and found that they could not win that case [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4798.42s)]
*  And when that came out the media and even biden himself said that merrick garland was basically being a wimp and should be tougher [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4804.02s)]
*  And so that's when they appointed jack smith to be the special counsel to go find some other way of prosecuting him [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4810.9800000000005s)]
*  And so that's why they've invented this novel legal theory [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4817.3s)]
*  Now I think the reason why we should care about this that has nothing to do with wanting to defend trump [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4819.46s)]
*  Or make him the nominee is that I don't think our political system should be weaponized this way [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4825.78s)]
*  Because when they can start inventing novel legal theories to get somebody that's what they've done here jason [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4831.14s)]
*  It's show me the man and i'll show you the prime now [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4836.58s)]
*  Try trump try to overthrow and reverse the election and he tried to do that by putting up a fake slate [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4839.14s)]
*  And he tried to convince pence to go along with it pence is an honorable person who wouldn't go along with it [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4846.820000000001s)]
*  And everybody in his cabinet said this is a bridge too far his [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4853.0599999999995s)]
*  His supporters from bar to pence [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4857.3s)]
*  To meadows all told him please stop what you're doing is illegal. You cannot overturn the government the election results [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4860.18s)]
*  But are you saying this and you're saying are you saying this is an expression of condemnation against trump? [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4867.14s)]
*  Or are you saying that that jack smith actually has I think it'll be proven that he broke the law [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4872.42s)]
*  I think it would be proven in the documents case that he also tried to cover it up [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4876.9s)]
*  But that's just my opinion. I believe that he's a criminal. I believe he will be held accountable [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4879.7s)]
*  I think he should be held accountable for trying to overthrow the election. He tried to overturn the election [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4883.7s)]
*  That is the most treasonous thing you can do you can come up with all of your charges of reason charge him with incitement [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4890.26s)]
*  They have not done that. They've invented this novel legal theory that never existed before [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4895.78s)]
*  He's a very smart guy when it comes to avoiding [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4899.3s)]
*  Accountability and I think that it's his the clock is running out for him. You know what jay cal do you not think that? [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4902.72s)]
*  It's a little surprising [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4909.379999999999s)]
*  That all of these charges are hitting [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4912.58s)]
*  Years after this event took place in the months leading up to the republican primary. No, I think it's [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4915.86s)]
*  That's the weirdest thing to me is like why would it take so many years? [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4922.179999999999s)]
*  To prosecute someone all those guys that went into capital the capital building they all got charged with crimes years ago [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4925.379999999999s)]
*  You know two years ago. Why is all this stuff falling on trump today? [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4931.379999999999s)]
*  It's like they beat his child grand jury in the case [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4934.66s)]
*  Yeah, and they take the whole thing out to build these because I will say it does feel like it is [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4937.54s)]
*  Interrupting a political process that if there were criminal charges to be filed [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4942.4s)]
*  I would have liked to have seen him file two years ago [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4946.66s)]
*  So this could all get adjudicated ahead of a political cycle now that it's in the middle of a political cycle [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4948.74s)]
*  It makes me as a u.s. Citizen nervous about the fact that there are agencies interfering in the political cycle [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4953.62s)]
*  You're so right [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4959.78s)]
*  He could have given the documents back when they asked for them and he could have said don't delete the tapes [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4960.66s)]
*  I'm talking about both. Yeah, and it takes it you change the subject to the case [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4966.1s)]
*  No, i'm talking about both cases. I'm talking about both cases concurrently. We're talking about the documents [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4969.78s)]
*  Is more solid but less important, okay [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4975.3s)]
*  Actually leonard says this in the new york times, but you asked me a question [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4977.94s)]
*  I I think it takes time to build a case properly and it took them a long time to get through the 400 people [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4981.7s)]
*  Who attacked the capital and brought tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4987.139999999999s)]
*  To the capital and put it in three hotels, which is why the oath keepers got 18 years [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4992.179999999999s)]
*  400 people have gotten sentenced in that for good reason they beat cops [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=4997.78s)]
*  They beat they broke down their way into the capital and they brought [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5002.74s)]
*  Dozens of ar-15s and they bought tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition and placed them in hotels around the capital. These are dangerous [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5006.82s)]
*  Domestic terrorists they would have shot him for that. That's not what he's being indicted for [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5014.179999999999s)]
*  They i'm talking about who they they already got those oath keepers on 18 years [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5019.139999999999s)]
*  I just want to read this one sentence from from leonard just to wrap this up because this is the new york times [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5023.46s)]
*  This is the new york times. He says you can think of the new charges as being both more important [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5028.74s)]
*  And less solid than trump's previous federal indictment [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5033.62s)]
*  Yeah, no, i'm listen. Everybody's gonna have different opinions on this. I I get that [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5037.46s)]
*  I just hope he has his day in court and I think he's guilty and I think it'll be proven that he's guilty [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5040.42s)]
*  And that it's time to start moving this towards a pardon and figuring out how to get him out of political life [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5045.7s)]
*  And give him a pardon for all these crimes. He's committed and let him off the hook [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5052.34s)]
*  But get him out and so that your party can fail to a good candidate [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5056.66s)]
*  That's what I hope happens [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5060.18s)]
*  I think one of the really tragic side effects of these [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5061.46s)]
*  Prosecutions where they're inventing novel legal theories clearly to get this man for what he did even though it was outrageous [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5064.18s)]
*  But I don't think criminal in the way you want it to be jason [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5071.54s)]
*  But the really tragic thing about this i would rather he didn't do this criminal activity. Yeah, I get it. I get it [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5074.660000000001s)]
*  I look I don't want him to be I've already denounced it. I'm not defending his actions [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5079.38s)]
*  I'm defending the integrity of our legal system [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5083.54s)]
*  And really the tragic thing about this the tragic thing about this is that I want the 2024 election to be about issues [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5086.1s)]
*  It's not it's going to be a referendum on what happened in 2020 [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5092.98s)]
*  And there is no way to convince either side of the american people [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5097.46s)]
*  That they're wrong about that the msnbc cnn crowd are going to believe that trump is guilty of a crime no matter [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5101.54s)]
*  Where this case comes out and by the way, I think trump's actually going to win this case [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5107.7s)]
*  Maybe not in the dc jury pool, but I think he'll win it [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5111.46s)]
*  On appeal because I just think the Supreme Court. Yeah, I think if he has to take it's from court [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5114.74s)]
*  He's going to win it because there's a novel legal theory by the way [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5118.26s)]
*  Jack smith took a case against the virginia governor [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5120.66s)]
*  To the stream court got overturned on appeal nine zero because of an outrageous legal theory there [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5123.9400000000005s)]
*  So that same thing could happen here. I think it probably will but but those people who believe in this will never be convinced [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5128.74s)]
*  And by the same token trump supporters the other half of the country will never be convinced that this was not a political persecution [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5134.5s)]
*  It's tds versus this. Hold on. This will tear the country apart [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5141.7s)]
*  And to freeberg's point, it's two and a half years later. We could have just moved on [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5146.02s)]
*  There's plenty of other things they already have the documents case [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5150.0199999999995s)]
*  So this is a political prosecution by biden's own doj. Do you have any way to get out of this? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5153.46s)]
*  What's your what's your solution to get out of this? We should have just moved on [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5158.98s)]
*  Oh not charge him. Yeah, listen the the proper forum to deal with this was the impeachment hearing [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5162.66s)]
*  The second impeachment was expressly on the correct charge which was whether trump incited insurrection [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5169.38s)]
*  They already had this trial [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5176.259999999999s)]
*  The proper forum was that impeachment trial? [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5178.02s)]
*  He made it through and it's up to voters to take this into account [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5180.900000000001s)]
*  Actually said the proper one was to go criminal. So it was interesting [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5184.02s)]
*  Yeah, he said the impeachment was the wrong way to do it. They should just do the criminal [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5186.9800000000005s)]
*  So here we are doing the criminal thing the country should have moved forward and instead we're going to turn apart [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5190.02s)]
*  And this is what 2024 is now going to be about what do you think? [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5194.740000000001s)]
*  Freeberg what do you think is a good path forward? I kind of align with the fact that this is a little bit too late [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5198.18s)]
*  It's in the middle of an election cycle and the damage that it will cause in terms of [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5204.42s)]
*  how our country [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5209.299999999999s)]
*  views the [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5210.66s)]
*  Intersection between the justice system and the electoral process can be more damaging [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5212.32s)]
*  Than the benefit we would gain from bringing an individual to justice for breaking the law in this case, unfortunately [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5217.219999999999s)]
*  The timing is just off and I think it's really scary [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5222.9s)]
*  All right, jason you have to ask what what is actually going to strengthen our democracy? [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5226.74s)]
*  What is the wisdom of bringing these charges I think this case shows a lack of wisdom [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5230.26s)]
*  I don't think it's going to strengthen our democracy. I think it's going to undermine it [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5234.42s)]
*  It's going to make this country more polarized and hyper partisan [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5237.14s)]
*  And it's not going to help us move past this era of our politics and I believe that a question towards me [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5240.820000000001s)]
*  I think trump is [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5245.860000000001s)]
*  Responsible for part of that polarization, but I think biden now is playing into it from the other side [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5247.3s)]
*  I don't think we've had a president [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5252.02s)]
*  seek to [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5254.42s)]
*  indict [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5255.62s)]
*  His leading political opponent who's likely to be involved in this this is the justice department. He's not he's not driving it [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5257.0599999999995s)]
*  Wait a second. That is not true [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5263.78s)]
*  Okay [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5265.78s)]
*  Yeah, he's he's not involved in it. No, there's an article in which biden said that when mary garland refused the incitement charges [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5267.0599999999995s)]
*  That he thought that it was weak in that biden thought that trump deserved to be prosecuted [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5276.099999999999s)]
*  And that was a public article is in the new york times and i'll provide the note [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5280.099999999999s)]
*  Okay, i'll provide the question for me. Do you have a question you said you wanted to ask me a question [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5283.62s)]
*  Well, no, I didn't say a question. I just said you can respond [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5287.54s)]
*  Oh, uh, but my my point is I now think that biden has crossed the line here [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5290.34s)]
*  And just remember this is not an independent prosecutor jack smith works for mary garland who works for joe biden [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5294.74s)]
*  This is banana republic type stuff. This is one president's doj [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5301.38s)]
*  Seeking to prosecute his main political opponent who put mary garland in biden appointed him [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5306.18s)]
*  Uh, yeah, so, uh, this has been the all-in podcast chamath had to bounce [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn-9ffDhGAo&t=5311.3s)]
