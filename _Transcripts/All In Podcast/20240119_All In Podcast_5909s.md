**All In Podcast:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo)
*  Alright everybody, welcome to the 54th annual World Economic Forum here in Davos. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=0.0s)]
*  You guys didn't know this, but as elites ourselves, we were invited to kick off the festivities. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=6.84s)]
*  Surplus. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=12.72s)]
*  Yeah, you know, the all in podcasts, very popular. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=13.72s)]
*  And so they wanted us to come and represent the pod and our audience there. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=16.12s)]
*  And it's been amazing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=20.68s)]
*  If you haven't seen some of the great musical performances this year, I mean, they're so [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=22.38s)]
*  notable. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=26.96s)]
*  Let's just start off here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=28.14s)]
*  I mean, guys, we were here for this live. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=29.3s)]
*  Soak it in. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=31.3s)]
*  I mean, I don't know if you've played it yet. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=34.3s)]
*  There's the air flute. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=37.3s)]
*  Wait, wait, there's a great moment when she really starts vibing. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=38.3s)]
*  Wait for the head shake. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=46.3s)]
*  The eyebrows are great, but the head shake comes in about there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=48.3s)]
*  There it is. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=53.3s)]
*  There it is. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=54.3s)]
*  I like your moo moo. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=55.3s)]
*  I like your moo moo. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=56.3s)]
*  Have you ever played the air flute? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=57.3s)]
*  Or just a skin flute, Jamal? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=58.459999999999994s)]
*  Just a skin flute. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=59.459999999999994s)]
*  I mean, I got there. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=60.459999999999994s)]
*  It's like a high school thing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=61.459999999999994s)]
*  But guys, guys, this isn't it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=62.459999999999994s)]
*  There were other, there was a witch doctor or something. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=63.459999999999994s)]
*  I'm not sure exactly what's going on here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=68.46s)]
*  I'm going to just apologize in advance for mocking this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=69.46s)]
*  Or for Sax mocking it, I should say. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=74.46s)]
*  This was incredible. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=80.46s)]
*  I don't know exactly what's going on here with the blowing of the hair. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=81.46s)]
*  But it's kind of like you are a father. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=84.46s)]
*  We've come a long way from COVID, that's for sure. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=86.46s)]
*  So they're blowing the COVID on each person's forehead here to spread the COVID. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=87.61999999999999s)]
*  They've all taken the mRNA vaccine. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=92.61999999999999s)]
*  But you know, we each have a speaking gig. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  Each of us is speaking. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=98.61999999999999s)]
*  And so I thought to kick us off here, gentlemen, instead of us just telling everybody our schedule, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  I would sing our schedule. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=107.61999999999999s)]
*  And so let me just grab, let me see if I got my guitar here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=109.61999999999999s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=112.61999999999999s)]
*  I got my guitar here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=113.61999999999999s)]
*  Let me just grab it here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=114.61999999999999s)]
*  Oh, here it is. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=115.61999999999999s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=116.78s)]
*  It's happened to have the guitar here. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=117.78s)]
*  Is that an air guitar or a real guitar? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=118.78s)]
*  Oh, there's a real guitar. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=119.78s)]
*  There's actually a real guitar here. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=120.78s)]
*  But I thought, you know, everybody is really excited about each of our speaking gigs. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=122.54s)]
*  So I thought we would just kick it off here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=127.02000000000001s)]
*  Let me just see if it's in tune. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=129.06s)]
*  You guys hear that? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=130.74s)]
*  Oh, okay. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=132.74s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=133.74s)]
*  I think we got it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=134.74s)]
*  Kumbaya, my lord, kumbaya. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=137.74s)]
*  Max is interviewing Putin, my lord, kumbaya. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=144.18s)]

*  Yes, the World Economic Forum is wrapping up in Davos. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=266.66s)]
*  If you don't know what the WEF is, I'll just give you the brief over you. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  3,000 people, five days, tons of parties. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=275.98s)]
*  Happens in Davos, Switzerland. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=278.3s)]
*  It's run by a foundation. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=280.34000000000003s)]
*  They call these non-government organizations, NGOs. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  You can think of it kind of like the TED conference topic this year was rebuilding trust. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=285.42s)]
*  It's politicians, business leaders, economists, journalists, all the elites. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  The mission statement of the WEF, improving the state of the world by engaging business [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=293.86s)]
*  power, political, academic and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=297.42s)]
*  agendas. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=302.7s)]
*  It's a money printing machine. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=303.7s)]
*  I'll give you a funny backstory later if you care to know. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=304.98s)]
*  But basically, they try to shake it down for about 40 grand a year to go to this thing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=308.14s)]
*  Tons of notable moments that we can get to on the docket here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=312.62s)]
*  Freebreak, any highlights for you watching this, you know, get mocked on social media [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=316.02s)]
*  this year? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=321.78000000000003s)]
*  It's been a slow unraveling from this being something that people used to flex about going [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=322.78000000000003s)]
*  to Davos. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=328.98s)]
*  Now people are literally apologizing on social media, ex Twitter, etc. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=330.18s)]
*  Explaining why they're going because they're kind of feeling shame in going to this event. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=335.98s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the sort of whole flipping of this from being a flex to requiring [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=340.82s)]
*  an apology in advance? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=347.78s)]
*  You guys know Andrew Ross Sorkin, the journalist for CNBC. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=349.62s)]
*  I think he posted on Twitter, you know, I know, I know, forgive me, I got to go to Davos. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=352.66s)]
*  It's almost like embarrassing now that you are associating yourself with the elite cabal [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=358.18s)]
*  in the Swiss Alps during a time of rising global populism and all the criticism that's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=364.98s)]
*  been rained down on Davos in the last couple of years. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=370.90000000000003s)]
*  And Davos is trying to adapt by trying to be more cool and appeal to the populist notions [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=373.14000000000004s)]
*  that have criticized them. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=380.86s)]
*  Thus, the flute playing, thus the shamanism, you know, and thus, I think a lot of what [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=383.38s)]
*  has called general economic support for what he defines as collectivism, which I'd love [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=390.3s)]
*  to talk about. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=396.14s)]
*  But why don't we just say that? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=397.14s)]
*  So I think there's generally been like a response from the community that attends Davos. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=398.14s)]
*  But there's a lot of conflict here with the fact that folks are flying in on private jets [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=402.7s)]
*  and telling everyone to stop producing carbon. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=406.5s)]
*  The fact that they're all dining and spending lots of money and telling everyone that we [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=409.46s)]
*  should move to more towards socialist conditions and higher taxation. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=412.86s)]
*  It's all a lot of irony wound up in this whole thing. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=416.1s)]
*  It's almost like a like a like a Simpsons show. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=419.18s)]
*  It's what it's become. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=421.53999999999996s)]
*  Well, and the theme rebuilding trust is kind of. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=422.53999999999996s)]
*  Insulting at its face, at least to me, like we don't trust you. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=426.9s)]
*  You don't need to rebuild trust with us. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=431.9s)]
*  We're not going to trust you. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=433.09999999999997s)]
*  There's no way for you to do that, especially after what happened with covid. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=434.09999999999997s)]
*  Sax, did you have any sort of reaction to this year's Davos and just how people are [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=436.97999999999996s)]
*  reacting to it? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=444.09999999999997s)]
*  You heard Freberg sort of thoughts on it. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=445.78s)]
*  Well, Davos has become a parody of itself. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=448.22s)]
*  And that's why you saw these clips go viral of these ridiculous antics of the priestess [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=450.62s)]
*  doing I don't know what she was doing. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=456.98s)]
*  But the only two sets of remarks that actually were taken seriously on their own terms was [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=458.62s)]
*  the speech by Malay from Argentina and then also comments by Jamie Dimon. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=465.26000000000005s)]
*  And the reason why they went viral is because they were actually saying sensible things [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=470.5s)]
*  that contradicted the sort of established wisdom or consensus at Davos. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=476.26s)]
*  I mean, they were effectively subtweeting the other elites at Davos. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=482.09999999999997s)]
*  I mean, Miele gets up there and I think he's introduced by Klaus Schwab and he immediately [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=487.09999999999997s)]
*  starts denouncing collectivist experiments and says that the West is in danger because [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=492.5s)]
*  its elites have been co-opted by a vision of the world, which leads inexorably to socialism [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=498.86s)]
*  and thereby to poverty. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=504.65999999999997s)]
*  So Miele basically says this right in front of Klaus Schwab. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=506.22s)]
*  I mean, he's describing the people at Davos. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=508.66s)]
*  That's why that took off and went viral. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=512.82s)]
*  It was incredible. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=514.78s)]
*  I mean, yeah. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=515.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=516.78s)]
*  In a similar way. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=517.78s)]
*  And he flew their commercial. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=518.78s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=519.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=520.78s)]
*  Yeah, kudos to him. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=521.78s)]
*  Jamie Dimon gave this interview, I think it was on CNBC, where he basically went full [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=524.78s)]
*  He basically admitted that Trump had been right and that a lot of the criticism of Trump [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=531.86s)]
*  and all the derogatory comments for years were basically just lazy. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=537.58s)]
*  And he said that Trump was largely right on NATO, on immigration, on tax reform. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=541.78s)]
*  He grew the economy well. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=549.54s)]
*  Immigration. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=551.02s)]
*  Immigration. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=552.02s)]
*  He was mostly right on China, he said. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=553.02s)]
*  Dimon said he didn't always like how Trump said things or talked about people, but he [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=555.22s)]
*  said his policies were largely sound and only look better in time since we've abandoned [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=559.9s)]
*  them. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=566.1s)]
*  And he's basically saying that, you know, look at where we are right now. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=567.1s)]
*  And he questioned the kind of everything is hunky dory narrative that the Biden campaign [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=570.3s)]
*  is pushing out. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=573.5799999999999s)]
*  So he really went off script there. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=574.92s)]
*  And like I said, I think Chamath said it first here on this pod three months ago. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=577.02s)]
*  And now Jamie Dimon is accepting that. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=581.26s)]
*  So that was a huge subtweet, you could say, of all the elites at Davos and the accepted [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=583.48s)]
*  wisdom and the narrative that they're all pushing out. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  So that was the other big interview that went viral. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=594.86s)]
*  And I think that's really saying something. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=600.6s)]
*  That the elites now have parodied themselves to the point where Davos has become a joke [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=603.8000000000001s)]
*  and the only talks or remarks out of Davos that people pay attention to are the ones [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=610.0s)]
*  talking sense to the people at Davos because they're not listening. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=616.66s)]
*  Chamath, your thoughts? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=622.04s)]
*  Look, everything has a season. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=623.28s)]
*  And I think that when there was a much more singular hierarchy of status, Davos played [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=626.0s)]
*  a very important role to signal to other people that you had made it. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=634.52s)]
*  But these things come and go. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=639.84s)]
*  And I think that this is sort of in the back half of its usefulness and half like what [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=641.96s)]
*  is it probably more than anything else now a glorified enterprise software sales conference [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=649.12s)]
*  where the reason to go to these conferences for a lot of these companies, I suspect is [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=655.16s)]
*  that it allows you to close very big deals, multimillion dollar licenses of this, that [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=659.56s)]
*  and the other thing where you can get the leaders of that counterparty across the table [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=665.56s)]
*  from you and hammer out a deal. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=669.8399999999999s)]
*  And I think you pay 40 grand a ticket for the right to get everybody together to do [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=671.9599999999999s)]
*  that. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=676.16s)]
*  So I think they want to pretend that it's a lot more than what it is. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=677.1999999999999s)]
*  And I think what it is is that. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=680.52s)]
*  And I think whenever you have the ability to convene people to close business, that's [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=682.2399999999999s)]
*  valuable. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=687.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think it's sort of in the eye of the beholder. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=688.84s)]
*  And it used to be that the beholder thought that this was important. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=692.44s)]
*  And now I think we realize it's much of nothing. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=695.96s)]
*  It's shaman and air flutes and all kinds of stupidity, which is why people have the courage [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=698.2800000000001s)]
*  to go and mock it. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=704.08s)]
*  And I think that Malay's comments and Jamie Dimon's comments exemplify that. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=705.36s)]
*  The only other thing I would say is that I had heard, although I haven't seen it, so [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=711.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=714.52s)]
*  Alex Karp apparently did a very thoughtful speech about anti-Semitism, which was also [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=715.84s)]
*  very countercultural to the established logic that the surplus elites at Davos want to believe, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=722.68s)]
*  which is the anti-Israel, pro-Palestine line. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=729.56s)]
*  I haven't heard it, though, so I don't know how impactful that was. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=732.48s)]
*  But those are the three things that I've just seen on Twitter. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=736.24s)]
*  The Malay speech, I think, is the one that everybody is keying on and correctly so. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=739.96s)]
*  Obviously, he's the new president of Argentina. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=745.52s)]
*  And this speech was amazing. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=749.4s)]
*  People might not also know that he was an economics teacher. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=751.12s)]
*  And so this talk about collectivism leading to suffering and regulatory capture and bloat, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=757.64s)]
*  which we'll talk a little bit about when we talk about Boeing today, was incredibly powerful. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=763.36s)]
*  It's super basic. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=768.96s)]
*  You know, listen, free markets work. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=769.96s)]
*  There are people opting into either side of it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=771.52s)]
*  He went over, essentially, without saying it, the rule of 72 and like 200 years of GDP [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=773.48s)]
*  growth and how GDP growth under capitalism rises everybody up. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=778.72s)]
*  And then collectivism, aka socialism, is a bit of a disaster. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=782.8000000000001s)]
*  But it's well worth watching it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=788.4s)]
*  There was a really cool thing that a company called Heigen did, H-E-Y-G-E-N. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=789.72s)]
*  With their AI tool, they just immediately took his speech, put it in his own words, [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=795.76s)]
*  and published it and translated it as if he was speaking English because he was speaking [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=801.16s)]
*  this native tongue. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=806.28s)]
*  So really worth checking it out. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=807.28s)]
*  And yeah, it was super notable. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=809.52s)]
*  It's pretty basic, but I think it's everybody wants to hear this right now, which is if [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=812.6s)]
*  you're picking collectivism and socialism and redistribution of wealth, Argentina has [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=818.0s)]
*  like a really good history of watching this fail. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=822.68s)]
*  And now they're in the process of dismantling it. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=826.48s)]
*  I'll say something else before Friedberg says something here, which I think is going [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=829.2s)]
*  to be very thoughtful. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=833.6s)]
*  Jason, the other reason why Argentina is a really good example to use is that what does [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=834.6s)]
*  Davos represent at a different level? [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=840.76s)]
*  Well, what it is, is old Europe getting together in a way that allows them to continue to coalesce [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=845.0400000000001s)]
*  power. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=851.76s)]
*  And what's interesting is if you had presented the case of any other country trying collectivism [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=852.96s)]
*  and failing, it wouldn't get nearly the same attention as Argentina. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=857.8399999999999s)]
*  And the reason is that Argentina has so many ethnic Europeans. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=862.5999999999999s)]
*  And I think that's another reason, which is like when you present people that are telling [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=866.56s)]
*  you it didn't work, that frankly look like you speak the same language as you. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=870.12s)]
*  I think it actually goes further in making the point than if you found somebody in South [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=874.4799999999999s)]
*  Asia or Africa that said the same thing to these folks, which they have, which they've [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=879.16s)]
*  not listened to. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=883.4s)]
*  And so this is why I think Malay is so interesting and important, because he looks the part of [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=884.8s)]
*  a Western leader. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=890.3599999999999s)]
*  And I think that that, unfortunately, is what it's going to take for some of these folks [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=891.4799999999999s)]
*  to listen. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=895.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=896.4s)]
*  And everyone's acutely aware. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=897.4s)]
*  I mean, I'll say three things on this. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=898.4s)]
*  One is just talking to your point, Jamath, about the history of Argentina and how it [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=899.4s)]
*  relates to this position that Malay holds and being able to speak credibly to this. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=901.8399999999999s)]
*  Second is what he said, which I think is really important. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=907.4399999999999s)]
*  And third is how it relates to the United States. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=909.16s)]
*  But this was clearly, from my view, one of the most important media events of the year. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=911.3199999999999s)]
*  I do think that anyone that's listening to us right now should go watch it and go listen [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=915.4399999999999s)]
*  to the entirety of the speech. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=919.02s)]
*  It is so important. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=920.68s)]
*  I hope everyone really takes in what he said. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=921.88s)]
*  Just briefly on Argentina, in the mid-19th century, Argentina was a colonial nation, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=925.0s)]
*  very agricultural, but a lot of free market, pioneerism going on. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=931.0s)]
*  I mean, it was a very, very, very, very, very rich country. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=936.92s)]
*  And then from the early 19th century, when there was an economic crisis, just as the [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=939.4799999999999s)]
*  20s were built and an economy flourished in Argentina, this photo I put up here is from [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=944.8399999999999s)]
*  1913, Buenos Aires, which at the time was called Paris of the West. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=952.36s)]
*  I was about to say, it looks like Paris, right? [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=957.52s)]
*  The architecture is beautiful and stunning. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=958.62s)]
*  But here's some statistics a lot of people don't know. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=960.92s)]
*  as of any nation on earth in 1913. And so it was this flourishing, vibrant economy with a lot of [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=963.7s)]
*  innovation, a lot of arts, a lot of building, a lot of employment, a lot of immigration. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=972.1800000000001s)]
*  And then as the series of military coups began, I don't know if you guys are aware, but there was [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=977.94s)]
*  a military coup in 1930, 1943, 1955, 1962, 1966, 1976. And in every one of these cases, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=983.22s)]
*  the essence of the coup was one of relativism, which is some people have benefited more than others. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=993.06s)]
*  As a result, we need to change the way that the government and the social structure is functioning, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=998.0999999999999s)]
*  and it has to be taken by force. And I think this is the big story of Argentina that says so much [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1002.66s)]
*  more than any other nation of the past century, century and a half, which is that these cycles [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1008.8199999999999s)]
*  happen based on not absolutism, but on relativism. And I'll just give you what I mean by that. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1014.8199999999999s)]
*  Millay made this point, which is so important from the year 1800 to the year 2020. In the year [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1021.14s)]
*  1800, we saw 95% of the world's population in extreme poverty. By 2020, it was less than 5%. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1027.1399999999999s)]
*  And this was driven by free market capitalism, democracies that allowed people, individuals to [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1035.1399999999999s)]
*  pursue their own self interests. And as a result, deliver products into a marketplace that people [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1041.94s)]
*  wanted and were willing to pay for. And that incentive, that market-based system, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1046.98s)]
*  allowed the entire world to move forward. The relativism problem is that some people move [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1051.78s)]
*  forward faster than others. And that causes this great cycle of what some people might call envy [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1056.66s)]
*  or jealousy. And Millay said it best, the West is in jeopardy, which is the key statement he was [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1060.98s)]
*  trying to make in his point that countries are no longer defending free markets. This is a quote, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1066.1s)]
*  private property and other institutions of libertarianism due to errors in their theoretical [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1071.8600000000001s)]
*  framework and ambition for power. Opening doors to socialism and condemning us to poverty, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1077.46s)]
*  misery and stagnation, socialism has failed in all countries where it was attempted. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1083.06s)]
*  And then he started to harp on about neoclassical economic theory and the issues of that. But I [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1088.5s)]
*  want to show you one last image, which speaks so clearly to the point that he's making, which is [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1092.5s)]
*  as these governments that are well intentioned and the people that elect the governments and [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1097.14s)]
*  put them in power are well intentioned, then try to redistribute wealth by getting the governments [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1101.14s)]
*  to step in and play a market role. The market role that they play causes inflation, causes [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1106.3400000000001s)]
*  degradation and economic opportunity, economic mobility and prosperity for most people. And you [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1112.9s)]
*  can see this in this chart, which we've looked at many times, but everything on the top of this [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1118.66s)]
*  chart, this is a chart that shows the 20 years of price changes of various goods and services in [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1123.14s)]
*  the United States. Everything that's gone up in price is something that the U.S. government [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1127.46s)]
*  has a role in buying or paying for. Yeah, controlling. Yeah. And everything that's [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1133.22s)]
*  gone down in price is where there is a free market that has allowed people to access goods [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1138.58s)]
*  and services at a lower price over time, as opposed to a higher price over time. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1143.3s)]
*  And while the intention is that the government is doing good for people by making education, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1147.46s)]
*  health care and other goods and services available to them, the government stepping in and [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1153.3799999999999s)]
*  intervening in the free market causes the price to go up. And ultimately you end up in a really [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1158.5s)]
*  negative cycle that resolves in this collectivism approach that he's talking about. And that's why [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1163.3s)]
*  I just wanted to tie back what he said to what's going on in the U.S. today. And I've harped on [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1168.18s)]
*  this a lot, but the growing role that the federal government is playing and the intention is good, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1172.5s)]
*  but the impact is bad over time. And that's really, I think why it was such an important [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1177.7s)]
*  speech. He was so clear. It was so important for me to hear it. I'm sorry I harped on, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1181.94s)]
*  but I just really know the key of his speech is, Hey, good intentions can lead to a bad outcome [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1185.6200000000001s)]
*  here. Yeah. You want everybody to have healthcare. You want everybody to have education. The [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1191.94s)]
*  government is providing it and there's no customer and there's no market. There's no competition. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1195.14s)]
*  And the products and services that you are referring to, they include medicine, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1200.26s)]
*  they include college, they include tutoring, they don't just include, and they include air [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1204.1000000000001s)]
*  conditioning. They include refrigerators and televisions, smartphones, all of that. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1208.02s)]
*  And picking which system and which set of problems you want to have, I guess, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1212.5s)]
*  is what societies need to do and free markets. It's a weird reflexive loop though for governments, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1217.22s)]
*  because these people, what he also said was these aren't just well-intentioned people. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1222.66s)]
*  They're also a small class of elites that wanted to feel like they were better than everybody else [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1226.26s)]
*  by implementing things at work. And so there is a dark part of this as well, which is their desire [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1231.54s)]
*  for power. And I think it's important to not gloss that over. So this wasn't just a bunch of [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1235.94s)]
*  bumbling do-gooders that screwed things up. This was also a bunch of folks that irrespective of [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1241.54s)]
*  the data had an opportunity to gain influence and power. And I think that that's an important [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1246.98s)]
*  thing to acknowledge because it created a very negative reflexive loop that governments used. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1252.66s)]
*  Meaning, if you look at Friedberg's charts, why did that happen? Well, part of what happened was [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1258.8200000000002s)]
*  the administrative state became more and more powerful. They were able to pass laws. They were [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1265.86s)]
*  there to decide who the winners and losers were. That is a drug, and that drug is very addictive. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1271.9399999999998s)]
*  And so what happened as this happened was the laws went and reinforced those dynamics of those [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1277.78s)]
*  people being able to decide winners and losers. The thing that has not happened yet though, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1283.62s)]
*  and maybe we're beginning to see it in some of these markets that the government is too involved [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1289.62s)]
*  in, is that it has bred a level of incompetence and incapability that we now have to unwind [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1294.34s)]
*  because the average everyday citizen's lives are either at risk or these services are just so [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1301.86s)]
*  expensive that it's just untenable. And I think that's where we are now. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1308.4199999999998s)]
*  It's a great segue, I think, into this Boeing issue that we've seen because here's an issue [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1312.6599999999999s)]
*  of regulation and safety where you want the government and you want safe planes and you [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1317.54s)]
*  want some level of regulation, but then you get regulatory capture. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1322.1s)]
*  But the government has not been the supporter of the safety agenda that citizens think. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1324.4199999999998s)]
*  Meaning, when you look at what has happened in the U.S. airline industry, there are a handful [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1331.1399999999999s)]
*  of end user providers, but those are all using OEM equipment from one of two vendors, Boeing or [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1338.1s)]
*  Airbus. So it's a duopoly, but in many ways it's a monopoly the way that these folks fight with [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1345.86s)]
*  respect to tariffs and imports and incentives. So the United States airline industry is a monopoly [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1351.94s)]
*  of one company. Now, if you look at what's happened, what they would say is, well, planes have [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1358.5s)]
*  become safer and safer and safer. Yes, but they've become safer in some ways, in the most [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1363.06s)]
*  simple and obvious ways, but they've become unsafe in that you have these fleets of planes that are [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1371.06s)]
*  now behaving very unpredictably. And if you look under the hood, what happens is, Boeing as an [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1375.7s)]
*  example, in like the last four years, how much money do you think they've spent on lobbyists and [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1382.9s)]
*  PACs? I'll tell you, $65 million. How much have they spent just in the last year? Almost $11 million. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1387.94s)]
*  They're like the 15th most active spender in politics in Washington. Now, what did they use [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1394.5s)]
*  that money for? Well, that's also documented. See, the crazy thing is this stuff happens in plane [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1401.54s)]
*  site. So they were able to water down the safety regulations. What does that allow you to do? It [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1406.26s)]
*  allows you to have a situation like this unfold. And then on the other side, the pilots unions can [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1411.94s)]
*  lobby those same politicians who are taking money from Boeing and prevent systems that would actually [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1418.02s)]
*  make these planes safer. You can have more improvements in the guide by wire technology. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1425.86s)]
*  You can have more improvements in GPS. You can have more improvements in a computer's ability [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1431.6999999999998s)]
*  to help improve and augment the capability of the pilot. Unfortunately, that would result either in [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1437.9399999999998s)]
*  fewer pilots or less pay. And so that doesn't happen nearly as fast and obviously as it should. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1443.06s)]
*  It's the same for air traffic control. And all of these issues build up because we've allowed [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1448.9799999999998s)]
*  monopolies to build up. So as much as we think we are a capitalist society, we have veered into [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1453.46s)]
*  this collectivism in certain markets and where it's measurable and obvious, we need to point at it [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1460.5s)]
*  and say, let's go fix it. Yeah. And this would be a, let me just tee up a little bit of what you're [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1465.78s)]
*  referring to in case people don't know, but everybody probably saw the news that on January [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1470.02s)]
*  5th, the door blew off of one of these Boeing 737 Max jets. If you've heard that name before, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1474.5s)]
*  it's because this isn't the first time that the Max jets have had problems. This plane safely [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1480.34s)]
*  landed, thank God. And there was nobody sitting in the row with the door blew off. And this has to do [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1485.62s)]
*  with some bolts on the doors, but this is just the start of problems with the 737 Max. There's an [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1490.98s)]
*  incredible documentary. If you haven't seen it, we'll put it in the show notes, Boeing's fatal flaw. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1497.1399999999999s)]
*  And the version before this, the 737 Max nine is the one that had the bolts come off your mouth. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1502.1s)]
*  The Max eight, if you remember, there were two really harrowing instances where tragically [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1507.5400000000002s)]
*  346 people died in these two instances because the plane, literally the software on the plane, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1512.8200000000002s)]
*  which is called Max Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which was designed because [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1519.14s)]
*  they were trying to get more fuel efficiency and they had positioned the engines in a weird way on [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1524.26s)]
*  the wings. So they had to kind of help pilots level this stuff. And to your point about regulatory [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1531.38s)]
*  capture, there was all this behind the scenes manipulation of the market to try to get these [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1536.74s)]
*  planes built, to try to get them out the door because there was so much money at stake. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1543.38s)]
*  Well, on these two terrible accidents, the plane, the nose literally dove and the pilots were [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1546.82s)]
*  fighting it in both cases. They just crashed and everybody on board died. And for 20 months, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1552.26s)]
*  the 737 Max models were grounded and that cost the company over $21 billion. So [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1559.22s)]
*  there is no competition to your point. And then in a free market, if there were 10 providers, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1566.3400000000001s)]
*  would this be much different to mouth? And absolutely. Yeah. So I mean, that's what you [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1570.26s)]
*  have to realize here is that these duopolies, you think there's competition in a duopoly. There is [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1574.18s)]
*  in competition. No, I mean, like, for example, like if you look at the car market, how many [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1578.1000000000001s)]
*  instances, I think the last big incidents that I remember was, I think Ford had an issue with the [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1582.5s)]
*  fuel tanks of some cars that were exploding, right? But the reality is when that happens, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1587.78s)]
*  there are alternatives. One is that there's legal requirements for Ford to just fix these things [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1593.46s)]
*  quickly. There are lawsuits that happened, there was class actions, there was settlements, but [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1598.9s)]
*  there's also the ability for folks that can afford it is just to switch vendor and of which there are [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1604.66s)]
*  50 other vendors to choose from. That is a healthy dynamic. So today, when you look at the auto [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1609.06s)]
*  market, what do you see a plethora of choice? And when you see fatalities or safety issues, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1614.58s)]
*  they are overwhelmingly driver error. Yes, we assume that and we get insurance to deal with that. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1619.86s)]
*  When you look at airplanes, you have these three sections of risk that each are compounding because [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1627.54s)]
*  there is no competition. Number one is that the monopoly vendor has zero pressure to actually [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1632.9799999999998s)]
*  test these things adequately. Because on the other side of building something well, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1639.78s)]
*  is shareholder pressure to deliver something sooner and faster so that they can reap more [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1645.22s)]
*  profits. Then second is you have a regulatory infrastructure that puts rules on top of rules, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1649.7s)]
*  but then will bend the rules if you donate to them. Right? And that's measured and known. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1655.6200000000001s)]
*  And then the third are the folks that actually operate the planes, who have this actual incentive [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1660.8200000000002s)]
*  to not see technical improvements because it defends their job for longer. And in all of these [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1665.7s)]
*  cases, there isn't enough competition to shine a light on this to say, how does society actually [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1671.62s)]
*  want this market to operate? This is collectivism. It's not working. Freiburg, you have thoughts on [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1677.06s)]
*  this Boeing regulatory capture and the issue of only having two vendors there? And the complexity [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1683.1399999999999s)]
*  of these machines now in relation to that? Nick, you can pull this up. This is an audit [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1689.62s)]
*  of the business model for a company called Transtime Group. Transtime Group is an [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1696.42s)]
*  aircraft aerospace parts manufacturer. They sell certified, regulated [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1702.5s)]
*  aircraft parts to aviation companies, as well as to airlines, private pilots, and also the government. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1709.94s)]
*  And they do about $7 billion in revenue, $3.5 billion in EBITDA. So to your point a couple [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1717.7s)]
*  weeks ago about what's the appropriate competitive EBITDA margin that a company can ultimately [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1724.42s)]
*  achieve, their EBITDA margin is 53%. This company is better than Facebook. Insane. On $7 billion of [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1730.5s)]
*  revenue and growing. Nick, if you want to pull up their stock chart, you guys can see how the [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1736.98s)]
*  business has performed over the years. And their business model has been relatively simple. They've [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1740.9s)]
*  acquired aerospace companies that have certified parts. They drop the cost and raise the price. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1746.66s)]
*  They do that over and over again. And here's the business over the last 10 years. This thing is [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1752.26s)]
*  roughly 10 bagger, 8 to 10 bagger in the last 10 years. The market cap is $60 billion today. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1758.34s)]
*  No end in sight. And so there was a government audit done of the business. By using uncertified [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1765.54s)]
*  cost data, which is one of the most reliable sources of information to perform cost analysis, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1771.54s)]
*  we found that TranStime earned excess profit of at least $21 million on 105 spare parts, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1775.62s)]
*  on 150 contracts. So they're selling spare parts into the government. The government auditor came [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1783.1399999999999s)]
*  in, audited them and identified because there's no real audit, there's no real accountability [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1787.86s)]
*  in government as purchasers, but there is regulatory authority on deciding who are the [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1793.54s)]
*  winners and who are the losers in the market. TranStime has been elected a winner because they [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1797.86s)]
*  have regulatory approval to make and sell these parts. The cost to get approval to make and sell [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1802.5s)]
*  these parts is so high that it makes it prohibitive for startups to come in and compete in this [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1807.46s)]
*  marketplace. And now that they're a preferred supplier and they get these single contracts [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1812.82s)]
*  where there's no competition to be a supplier, they can raise the price every year. Multiple audit [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1817.86s)]
*  reports over the last 23 years have highlighted the problem of the Department of Defense paying [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1822.82s)]
*  excess profits on sole source contracts where cost analysis was not used to determine fair [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1827.22s)]
*  and reasonable prices. And this problem continues to occur. Now, I'm not necessarily saying that [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1831.94s)]
*  this is a negative on TranStime. It's a fantastic business. It's well-run. It's one of the best-run [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1837.06s)]
*  public companies with a multi-$10 billion market cap in the world. But the condition is that the [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1841.46s)]
*  U.S. government comes in and picks and chooses through its regulatory authority which companies [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1846.5800000000002s)]
*  can make products. The cost to enter and compete becomes prohibitively high. And then the company [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1850.74s)]
*  has complete pricing power and there's very little accountability in the overall system. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1856.26s)]
*  And I think that this plays out not just with this company but obviously also with Boeing and [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1860.0200000000002s)]
*  the fact that we've narrowed down the competitive market space to just a few sole source providers [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1864.1000000000001s)]
*  that have very little accountability and eventually these sorts of conditions arise. Either prices get [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1869.38s)]
*  too high, quality degrades, all the other things that natural market forces would keep a check on. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1873.5400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And in terms of competition, Chamath, I guess the only thing you could say is consumers [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1878.5s)]
*  could potentially maybe try to avoid the 737 MAX. I know I did. When all these accidents happen, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1885.06s)]
*  I just told my person who books the flights, hey, do not put me on a 737 MAX, period, full stop. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1892.1799999999998s)]
*  And you know what? You're going to wind up paying a lot more. You're going to have a hard time [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1898.58s)]
*  getting certain routes. You're going to reduce it because most airlines, I think, have these [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1901.86s)]
*  737 MAXs in there. So when you have such a few number of providers, to your point about it's [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1907.3s)]
*  not like cars, it's not fragmented like that. You can't avoid a certain car type, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1912.02s)]
*  a plane type, the way you can avoid a car type. So just wrapping up here, Chamath, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1916.5s)]
*  what changes should we see in terms of late stage capitalism? Something in the example like air [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1920.34s)]
*  travel and manufacturers? Is there any way to unwind this reasonably? Or is it too late because [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1927.7s)]
*  we're at this too much? I go back to some of the examples that we've made fun of before. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1934.66s)]
*  You have to rely on the government to actually be competent in key moments in time. I think this is [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1941.7s)]
*  one of them. The organization that could do something about it, for example, take the FTC [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1948.58s)]
*  or even take the DOJ, we are investigating Amazon's purchase of the portable vacuum cleaner, Roomba. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1954.4199999999998s)]
*  Right? Critically important issue. And that is apparently for the American people, higher than [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1965.46s)]
*  the sclerosis that the government has enabled in the airline industry, which affects everybody. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1973.94s)]
*  So could the right government agencies choose to actually focus on something important here [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1981.06s)]
*  and actually figure out, hmm, why is this happening? Because I think the doorplugs issue [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1986.58s)]
*  is endemic of a much bigger problem. This is a company that's rotting because there is no [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1994.82s)]
*  accountability. And the reason there's no accountability is there's no real functional [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=1999.22s)]
*  competition. And I have not seen any good answer to accountability other than competition. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2002.98s)]
*  Aaron Norris Yeah, I mean, the good news is the FAA really took quick action to ground these [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2010.34s)]
*  171 Boeing 7379 MAX airplanes. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2017.94s)]
*  But they do not understand the scope of the problem if they let them back in the fleet and [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2021.22s)]
*  this is happening. Aaron Norris [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2025.7800000000002s)]
*  The bigger picture problem of lack of competition. Yeah. They are... [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2026.8200000000002s)]
*  No, no, no. My point is like, you have to adjudicate the interaction of very complicated [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2029.7800000000002s)]
*  hardware and software in that first go around. Here is just a pure systemic hardware failure. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2037.5400000000002s)]
*  So the point is that whether it's them or their suppliers, there's just some complacency that sets [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2045.3s)]
*  in when you know you will always have the business to Friedberg's point. It is a very corrosive thing [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2054.34s)]
*  in running a business, trying to have motivated employees when they know on the back end of it [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2060.98s)]
*  that they could make anything in the world, and they'll just be able to sell it to somebody and [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2070.2599999999998s)]
*  they'll have to take it. That's that example that Friedberg just cited. 20 odd million dollars for [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2074.58s)]
*  just random stuff. What is it? 15 pieces. That's crazy. That's just straight up theft. And so when [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2080.2599999999998s)]
*  you have that, how do you expect the employees of that organization to give a s***? I don't see how [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2088.1s)]
*  you could expect that. And so my point is the FAA has a much bigger problem. So for example, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2094.98s)]
*  like the DOE has a loan program to try to create a diverse energy infrastructure in the United States. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2099.86s)]
*  Maybe we need to look at some of these sectors and instead of building the administrative state, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2106.02s)]
*  take some of that money instead and just create programs to get more competition. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2110.5800000000004s)]
*  All right. In other news, Adam Newman, you remember from WeWork, Infamy slash Fame, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2115.1400000000003s)]
*  has a new startup. You may have heard of it, Flow. They've raised a ton of money. He started buying [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2121.3s)]
*  a bunch of apartment buildings. The idea, people can rent nice apartments in cool cities [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2125.54s)]
*  that focus more on social interaction and hacking out common spaces, all that great stuff. And there's [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2130.9s)]
*  also allegedly or reportedly some sort of rent to own where renters can receive equity in the company [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2136.82s)]
*  over time. And I don't think this has ever been released, but the idea would be maybe you own [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2143.86s)]
*  shares in Flow. Flow manages around 3000 units, most of which were purchased by Newman after he [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2148.66s)]
*  left WeWork and he took down a windfall as an exit package. And so according to the Real Deal, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2154.5s)]
*  this is a real estate publication, Newman had a 60 million variable rate mortgage on [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2160.1s)]
*  one of these properties in June. Sax, maybe you could explain to us what's going on here since you [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2164.5s)]
*  have a lot of experience in real estate. Well, it's pretty simple. He can't make his interest [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2168.82s)]
*  payments. Okay. So the reason is, is because he had floating rate debt. So if he had locked in his [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2173.7s)]
*  debt over say 10 years back in when he bought this building in 2021 or whenever it was, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2180.58s)]
*  when interest rates were extremely low, you know, that was during the ZERP period, [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2186.8199999999997s)]
*  probably could have locked in long-term debt at maybe even 3%, 3% or 4%. And instead he got [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2191.86s)]
*  floating rate debt. And if you look at where commercial debt is now, I mean, it's 7%, 8%, 9%, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2198.66s)]
*  if you can get it, which is pretty hard. So he maxed out on debt when he bought these buildings, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2204.66s)]
*  he bought them top of market. It sounds like in 2021, because real estate, like a lot of things, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2209.46s)]
*  moves inversely to interest rates. So when interest rates spiked over the last year or so, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2216.1s)]
*  then real estate valuations went down. So he bought a bunch of buildings, top of market, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2222.7400000000002s)]
*  using a lot of debt that was floating rate, interest rates spiked, perfect storm. Now he [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2227.86s)]
*  can't make his interest payments. The crazy part about this, when I was watching it happen, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2232.9s)]
*  Jamath, and we talked about it, I think, on the program at the time was, Andreessen Horowitz put [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2237.14s)]
*  in like, over 300 million at a billion dollar valuation, but they didn't do that in P-XERP. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2241.46s)]
*  They did that in 2022. And the writing was on the wall. What are your thoughts on why they would [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2246.18s)]
*  make a bet like that? And yeah, just tech VCs betting on real estate for a second time. How [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2251.14s)]
*  does that occur? Well, I don't think it occurs because they cared about real estate. I think [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2259.14s)]
*  it allows them to take $300 million of committed capital and put it out there so that they're $300 [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2264.42s)]
*  million less available, which means that they're $300 million closer to raising a new fund, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2272.5s)]
*  which means that they can raise, they can charge 2% on more money. That's why they did it. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2278.26s)]
*  Got it. Yeah. So just keep the money train deploying capital. It's a place where you can [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2282.82s)]
*  put a big, huge check and you can raise your next fund and yeah. Why not? Yeah. Okay. Well, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2288.1800000000003s)]
*  there you have it. I mean, let me, let me offer. I mean, I don't disagree. I think that candidly, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2293.62s)]
*  what you've said is exactly how mega funds are thinking about it. We have to deploy capital to [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2298.5s)]
*  raise our next fund. And if we still have capital in our last fund, then we can't deploy. If you're [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2302.8199999999997s)]
*  going to have to deploy large amounts of capital, wouldn't you feel better deploying that capital [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2308.2599999999998s)]
*  with an entrepreneur who's actually run a big business before, even though the business failed? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2314.42s)]
*  No, no, no. If you're, if you're, if you, if you were not optimized for fees, you would do [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2319.46s)]
*  what Peter Thiel did and just have the fund and return the money. Right. And for, for, for, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2322.82s)]
*  because he's already won, but for everybody else that's trying to win, the only way to win [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2329.06s)]
*  in a world where your, your exits are not that great is to actually generate money via fees, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2333.62s)]
*  even though that fees are taxed at current income, that's the way to win in venture is not [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2339.86s)]
*  carried. It's by fees. And so it's, and I don't blame Andreessen. I think like that's, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2344.26s)]
*  that's smart for them to do. And if they have folks that are willing to enable that by giving [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2350.42s)]
*  them money, they should do it. But are they going to generate huge rates of return? Probably not, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2354.7400000000002s)]
*  because that's not what real estate is known for. Real estate is known for long steady tax orbs [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2360.82s)]
*  that slowly compound for the, for the owner of the company over 20 or the owner of the business [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2366.42s)]
*  over 25 to 35 years. That's not what a venture fund is supposed to be doing for a 10 year, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2370.98s)]
*  12 year return cycle. So obviously they're doing it for fees. That's okay. I think that's capitalism. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2376.5s)]
*  But what are the LPs then think? Sax, if we look at this, you know, you're an LP in a technology [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2381.14s)]
*  firm, I'll take Andreessen out of it for a second, but let's just say some giant LP gives [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2386.5s)]
*  giant amounts of money to a venture capital firm, and then they're deployed in real estate. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2390.5s)]
*  What happens, you know, in their minds, and is there any kind of tension that would occur? [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2397.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, you can never judge a VC based on one investment. If we were to do that, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2401.94s)]
*  every VC would have a lot of egg on their face because we're supposed to take big swings and [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2408.34s)]
*  swing for the fences and try and hit home runs and grand slams. And a lot of them are going to make [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2412.66s)]
*  you look foolish. You have to look at an investment portfolio and track returns over time. So I [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2416.98s)]
*  wouldn't judge any particular investor based on one investment. So I don't think that's fair. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2422.66s)]
*  Now, in the case of this investment, if you want me to explain what I think went wrong, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2429.2999999999997s)]
*  I think Adam Newman had a compelling vision. His vision was to create a new experience in, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2435.06s)]
*  I guess you call it apartment living, and that people would be willing to pay more for that [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2441.54s)]
*  because he would create this national brand in apartments. And right now, apartments are [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2446.8199999999997s)]
*  super local and there is no brand in apartment living. So I think as an entrepreneur, as an [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2451.46s)]
*  operator, he had a great vision. And I think he actually achieved his vision. If you read these [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2458.18s)]
*  articles carefully, what they say is that his occupancy was high and people were willing to pay [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2463.54s)]
*  at least a little bit more for the experience of being in a flow apartment. The problem for [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2470.02s)]
*  Adam Newman is that at the end of the day, his plan to raise rents by creating an experience, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2475.3s)]
*  even though it worked, it just didn't raise rents that much. And what ended up being much more [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2481.86s)]
*  important were the moves and interest rates and how he capitalized these acquisitions and the [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2487.1400000000003s)]
*  price he paid on the acquisitions. So there's an old saying in real estate that you make money [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2493.78s)]
*  based on the buy, not on the sell, meaning that when you go and sell your apartment building, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2498.9s)]
*  office building or whatever, you're monetizing an acquisition that you did correctly. And if you [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2505.78s)]
*  don't buy at the right price, you're never going to be able to make money on the sale. And I think [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2510.9s)]
*  this is a really good example of this where he bought at top of market, his capital stack was [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2514.7400000000002s)]
*  over reliant on debt and he had floating rate debt. I mean, those are just financial mistakes [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2521.38s)]
*  and timing mistakes that you can't make up for no matter how good an operator you are in real estate. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2527.46s)]
*  And in a way, I mean, this is the same thing that happened with WeWork, which is he delivered an [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2534.1s)]
*  excellent product. I mean, people love WeWork offices. Absolutely. Yeah. They pick them [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2538.98s)]
*  over other offices because of the vibes, because of the culture, because of the community. So he [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2544.58s)]
*  is a man, he has some mastery of that, but to your point, entry price matters and the economics [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2550.1s)]
*  matter. If you look at WeWork, it didn't fail because the product wasn't good. It was because [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2555.3s)]
*  he didn't pay enough attention to the financial aspects of the business. With WeWork, he leased [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2559.6200000000003s)]
*  a bunch of offices at the absolute top of the market and then over invested in TI's tenant [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2565.0600000000004s)]
*  improvements. With Flow, he bought a bunch of real estate at the top of the market and sort of [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2569.78s)]
*  did it with the wrong capital stack. So this is the problem is that when you get into a real estate [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2574.5s)]
*  business, it doesn't really matter how great you are as an entrepreneur operator if you're not good [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2579.46s)]
*  at like sort of the legacy old school real estate part of it. And the old school real estate guys [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2587.14s)]
*  were saying during WeWork, this is not going to work. This is regis, but with a bad capital [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2594.26s)]
*  structure. And the old school real estate guys were saying something similar about this. And [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2600.82s)]
*  it just goes to show that if you are going to try and disrupt a legacy industry, you do have [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2606.42s)]
*  to kind of understand the ins and outs of that legacy industry. And the great paradox of this, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2611.54s)]
*  Sachs, was when he did GreenDesk, which was the precursor to WeWork, when he did the first WeWorks [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2616.1s)]
*  in San Francisco and other places, his playbook was, find a building that's empty that cannot [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2621.54s)]
*  be leased. So he got 25 Taylor Street, like sixth and market, the worst area by the Tenderloin. And [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2626.9s)]
*  we had an office there for a little bit and I have my podcasting studio there for a little bit. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2632.82s)]
*  This was a terrible off, this was a terrible area, but he made it hip and cool. And it was [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2636.42s)]
*  really cheap. And man, it sold out and it was packed and the vibes were great. But then, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2640.9s)]
*  as you're saying, then he moved all of a sudden to Soma and he started opening up these glass [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2646.58s)]
*  filled ones. And, you know, the, he was renting them for less with all their giveaways and six [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2650.5s)]
*  months free and all this stuff than they could ever afford. So he kind of had mission drift, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2656.42s)]
*  right? The playbook, they just, they changed the playbook and economically was not viable. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2660.66s)]
*  Well, the timing, the timing got really bad. And again, they didn't pay attention to the financial [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2665.78s)]
*  aspects as much as they should. In this case, I think that if he was trying to execute this play [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2670.7400000000002s)]
*  today and doing his acquisitions today, he could actually make it where he would, you need a lot [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2676.7400000000002s)]
*  more equity because he wouldn't be able to get as much debt financing. But if he had the equity [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2681.94s)]
*  and could do more of an acquisition based on equity, the prices he had paid right now would be [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2686.02s)]
*  much lower. And then as interest rates come down, he could ride that wave. He could refi, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2690.42s)]
*  pull his equity out and put debt on it that is cheaper as the price goes down. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2695.54s)]
*  So there was a way to maybe make this work, but you know, with real estate, the timing is just so [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2701.54s)]
*  important. Again, your cost basis of when you get in the investment is probably the most important [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2706.82s)]
*  thing in terms of whether you make money or not. Did you see this by chance, the real estate piece [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2713.3s)]
*  in 60 minutes, the package they did last week, Sachs? It was basically what we were talking about [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2717.86s)]
*  here a year ago. Super compelling if you haven't seen it. It's basically the oil in pockets from [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2722.6600000000003s)]
*  12 or 18 months ago. Has anything changed on the field in terms of commercial real estate or is it [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2726.9s)]
*  just continuing to collapse? No, I mean, that's changed. I think that all the commercial real [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2732.6600000000003s)]
*  estate guys, the sponsors and the deal makers and so forth, they're all kind of hanging on by their [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2737.06s)]
*  fingernails waiting for interest rates to come down. And all the leases are still coming off, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2743.22s)]
*  right? Like people are still who had six, seven, eight year leases that were signed pre-COVID. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2748.8199999999997s)]
*  It depends on the market. I mean, some of the markets are coming back, but again, what this [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2752.8199999999997s)]
*  flow news showed, this Adam Newman news shows is that you could be fully occupied and you could [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2759.2999999999997s)]
*  still default. And the reason is because of your capital structure, the interest rates have spiked [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2767.14s)]
*  up. You're now paying all of your operating income is being eaten up by your debt service. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2771.54s)]
*  The only way to make it through that is you go to your bank. It was one of these regional banks [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2779.46s)]
*  and you work out a deal to extend. They call it pretend and extend. And they let you hang on [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2784.98s)]
*  there. You'll extend the term of your load. Kick the can down the road, yeah. Yeah. They'll lower [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2791.7s)]
*  your debt payments in exchange for more term. And you just try to get to the other side [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2796.42s)]
*  of these high interest rates. And then once you get to the other side, again, you're hanging on, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2800.74s)]
*  you're not defaulting. That's what everyone's doing. So if rates don't come down as expected [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2805.38s)]
*  this year, I think the market's expecting 150 basis points of rate cuts. If that doesn't actually [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2810.74s)]
*  happen, there's a lot of real estate sponsors who are in trouble. And in turn, there's a lot [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2816.74s)]
*  of regional banks who are in trouble because they're the ones who made all these loans to these [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2822.1s)]
*  sponsors. So everyone's trying to, like you said, kick the can down the road. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2826.5s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Yeah. And the 60 minutes piece also talked about how there's some emergency [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2829.78s)]
*  rezoning going on in New York specifically where they take the floor plate in the middle, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2835.46s)]
*  which I think you talked about, Sachs, you have to have windows if you want to convert to residential. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2840.18s)]
*  And they just make an empty space, the void they call it, in the middle of the building that, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2844.5s)]
*  you know, they'll deal with in the future. But they just have this empty space in the middle [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2849.94s)]
*  of the building that's not going to get used. And then the rest that has windows gets used to [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2853.22s)]
*  be converted into lofts, etc. in New York. So people are starting to think creatively [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2857.9399999999996s)]
*  if people don't come back to office. Okay, let me ask you a question just based on that [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2862.4199999999996s)]
*  set of comments. Given Adam Newman's experience as an investor in this space and this general [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2867.06s)]
*  opportunity, wouldn't you rather back a known someone who knows and has been through the market [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2873.06s)]
*  and has experience versus some founder who shows up and has never run a business in this space? [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2877.7s)]
*  I mean, this guy has more experience than anyone else. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2882.42s)]
*  It's such a great point. Well, here's the thing, Freeberg. The great point about that is [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2884.5s)]
*  you don't see a lot of founders who explicitly come out and say, I want to build a hundred [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2889.1400000000003s)]
*  billion dollar business. I want to build a giant business. They're so rare that VCs who have a lot [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2892.82s)]
*  of chips, they would like to back those, you know, swing for the fences folks. And so I do understand [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2898.42s)]
*  why people would back him again. And they've run at it before they've done it to some degree. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2904.42s)]
*  I mean, yeah, they failed. They learned from mistakes. And this time around, he learned from [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2907.94s)]
*  those mistakes. Yeah, but this is the exact same mistake. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2912.1s)]
*  So therefore they made the bad bet. I'm not advocating, by the way. I'm just asking. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2914.18s)]
*  No, I understand. But to your point, Freeberg, I can understand people want to bet on somebody [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2918.1s)]
*  who is crazy and swings for the fences. This entrepreneur clearly does not learn from their [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2922.02s)]
*  mistakes. I think both of those things could be true. Right, Trimah? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2927.06s)]
*  What I would say is that I think that where I've made the biggest mistakes in my investing career [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2930.1s)]
*  is when I confused what I was investing in, for one thing, when it was the other. And so when I [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2935.8599999999997s)]
*  look back, and I had a small dalliance in biotech, because I thought, oh, this is going to be more [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2942.42s)]
*  computational biology. And I understand computation. So this gives me an edge. Turned out I was wrong. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2948.98s)]
*  There was another time where I've invested in certain sectors of the economy, because I thought [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2955.7s)]
*  they were technology businesses. And at best, they were tech enabled versions of an existing [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2959.8599999999997s)]
*  industry. And when I look at those investments, the thing that I got wrong was not listening to [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2964.26s)]
*  the very experienced investors in those sectors and why they passed. And that has caused me [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2972.26s)]
*  no shortage of headache and grief. And so if I had to learn anything from all of this, it would be [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2980.34s)]
*  that if it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck. It's not a tech company. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2986.5s)]
*  And so if that duck means it's a real estate business, I would talk to a real estate investor [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2992.58s)]
*  and wonder to myself why they wouldn't have done this deal. Similarly, you know, when it's a biotech [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=2997.94s)]
*  business, I have to ask myself, why wouldn't they have done it? They know more than I ever will in [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3003.46s)]
*  this space. And so similarly, I kind of look at this as an example of that, which is, could be a [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3008.98s)]
*  very talented person in an industry. I think just like it's important for us to be very clear and [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3014.98s)]
*  lucid and intellectually honest about what industry that is. I think it's a great point. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3020.5s)]
*  I mean, look, I think whenever you're dealing with a tech enabled business, which I would define as [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3024.9s)]
*  a more traditional business model with some sort of software layer, you know, on top of it, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3030.18s)]
*  you have to kind of assess like how much of a difference does that software really make at the [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3038.1s)]
*  end of the day. In this case, this is a real estate business with a very thin kind of software [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3043.94s)]
*  slash operators. Yeah, the experience layer is a very small part of the overall, let's call it P and L [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3050.9s)]
*  of this business. Such a great point. Sax, I mean, a perfect analogy would be like if you have, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3060.7400000000002s)]
*  if you're taking a flight on United, the United app is delightful. Now it's a really good app. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3066.42s)]
*  This is a commercial airline. It's called United Airlines Sax. You pay for one ticket instead of [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3071.06s)]
*  the whole plane. But have you been to a McDonald's recently? I actually went to McDonald's. Yeah, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3074.82s)]
*  you order through an app now and there's a big screen. The point is you walk in there and it's [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3078.34s)]
*  probably not the McDonald's you knew 15 or 20 years ago. It's not about waiting in line [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3082.18s)]
*  and ordering. And that's not how it works anymore. So the point is, is that a tech [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3087.46s)]
*  enabled business or is that still a restaurant? Well, if you spend a lot of your time intellectually [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3092.1s)]
*  contorting yourself to try to justify why the next version of McDonald's is a tech enabled [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3097.14s)]
*  business, you're just going to lose a lot of money. It's a restaurant. Now all restaurants need [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3102.18s)]
*  technology. And what you see by McDonald's is even the oldest and most established are running [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3107.14s)]
*  forward very quickly to implement technology because they know that it creates efficiency, [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3112.42s)]
*  which then flows to the bottom line for them. So the reality is that we have lived in this wonderland [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3117.94s)]
*  where we've looked at these software businesses that have 80 and 90% gross margins and impose [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3124.5s)]
*  that expectation on other markets, and then made investment decisions by trying to justify how [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3128.82s)]
*  that it's a tech enabled real estate business, a tech enabled healthcare business, a tech enabled [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3133.5400000000004s)]
*  energy business without being honest with ourselves that those businesses have over decades because of [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3139.6200000000003s)]
*  lots of competition, found a consistent and reliable resting place in terms of gross margins [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3145.86s)]
*  far below 80 and 90%. And so instead of willing tech enabled businesses to be at 80 and 90 and [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3153.8599999999997s)]
*  tricking oneself, I think it's more realistic to ask yourself, why aren't 80 and 90% gross margin [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3160.8199999999997s)]
*  businesses decaying to 30 and 40% gross margins like every other part of the economy, when [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3165.7s)]
*  everything will be technology enabled? I think that that's a very reasonable question. And I [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3171.3799999999997s)]
*  think the answer is there is no safe place. I don't think that you can justify 80 and 90% [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3175.46s)]
*  gross margins in software when you can use a model and whip up a competitor. I just think that [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3180.18s)]
*  we are all going to a place where everything is a tech enabled version of some. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3185.22s)]
*  Yeah, marketplaces would be a notable exception there with network effects. So DoorDash versus [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3190.02s)]
*  the tech enabled restaurant asset light marketplaces, you and I and Sachs have been involved in a bunch [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3194.8199999999997s)]
*  of different marketplaces together. Sometimes they're asset heavy, sometimes they're asset [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3199.46s)]
*  light. When they're asset heavy, man, it's really hard to make those businesses work, Sachs. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3203.46s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think we should differentiate between gross margin and then the net operating [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3208.5s)]
*  margin or profit, right? And so, you know, gross margin is what is the cost on the margin of [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3215.3s)]
*  providing one incremental unit? And the thing about pure software businesses is that on the margin, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3222.34s)]
*  you can provision another instance of the product almost for free. I mean, there's a little bit of [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3228.66s)]
*  hosting cost at AWS or whatever. So on the margins, it's, you know, it's like the perfect [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3232.34s)]
*  gross margin business. As opposed to a hamburger. As opposed to a, yeah, a restaurant is going to have [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3237.86s)]
*  very large cost of goods sold or cogs. The simple heuristic that I use is just does [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3244.26s)]
*  this company have large cogs, cost of goods sold and are they physical world cogs? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3251.78s)]
*  If they are, it's not a software business. It's at best a tech enabled business. So just look for that. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3257.7s)]
*  You know, does this business have large physical world cogs? Now, what I would say is if the cogs [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3267.22s)]
*  are virtual, like, you know, it could be hosting costs or it could be paying Twilio for [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3273.14s)]
*  Telephony or something like that, then at least it's still not like as good a business because the [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3280.1s)]
*  margins aren't as good, but it's very scalable, right? Because you're not, you don't have that [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3285.14s)]
*  huge friction of needing to scale up physical world infrastructure, physical world supply chains, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3290.42s)]
*  that kind of stuff. So I like virtual cogs a lot better. There are digital cogs a lot better than [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3295.94s)]
*  physical cogs. I love it when marketplaces though, I mean, we could speak to that too, you know, when [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3301.7799999999997s)]
*  I had Dara on the pod the other week and when he launches an adjacency, hey, we're going to sell [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3306.34s)]
*  alcohol, hey, we're going to sell groceries, hey, we're going to add this thing that's right next [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3311.3s)]
*  to the already portfolio of Uber offerings, doesn't cost them much, right? They just have to get the [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3315.3s)]
*  supply side up and running, but they already have the demand side. And I think that's where like [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3320.9s)]
*  these super apps are doing really well, or Airbnb adding, you know, some inventory in a new city [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3324.02s)]
*  that they unlock, right? Well, true marketplaces are perfect gross margin businesses as well, [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3329.3s)]
*  because they don't have a physical inventory that they themselves own. What you'll see is with a [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3334.82s)]
*  lot of marketplaces, they'll cheat by buying the inventory themselves, at least to jumpstart the [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3339.06s)]
*  market and then selling it. And so when you see that line item on the P&L, you know, that they [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3346.5s)]
*  have real cost of goods sold, you know, oh, wait a second, this isn't a true marketplace, they're [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3352.34s)]
*  providing the service. And so again, it's just a way to like catch whether the business is truly [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3357.94s)]
*  one of these great high gross margin businesses or whether it's more of a tech enabled business [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3364.58s)]
*  that's pretending to be a pure software business. Yeah, direct to consumer got people in a lot of [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3370.34s)]
*  trouble during the last cycle in venture capital. If you look at a lot of these companies, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3375.1400000000003s)]
*  even the best SaaS businesses have seen their gross margins erode by about 15 to 20%. It used [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3383.6200000000003s)]
*  to be that best in class software business can generate 90, 91%, 88, high 80s to low 90s gross [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3391.22s)]
*  margins. Now that's not true. You see a lot of these best in class companies that are in the high [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3398.5s)]
*  60s and low 70s. So it already just shows you that that pressure has come upon the market. And so [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3402.1s)]
*  is it that the software enabled business goes towards 85 or is that the 85% gross margin [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3408.4199999999996s)]
*  business goes towards 30? It looks like it's the latter. That's just what the data says. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3413.06s)]
*  Well, maybe I'm just categorizing certain costs differently than you are, but I don't know why [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3416.98s)]
*  a software business would go all the way to 30, right? Because again, sales and marketing don't [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3421.22s)]
*  count in the gross margin. G&A doesn't count. Even R&D doesn't count in the gross margin. It has to be [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3424.66s)]
*  a unit cost that you can attribute on the margin to that incremental instance of the product. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3431.78s)]
*  So things like, again, paying Twilio for metered telephony or paying OpenAI for metered API access, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3438.02s)]
*  all of that is definitely in cogs. And I think some customer support costs that can be attributed [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3446.66s)]
*  on kind of a per instance basis, that goes in there. But if sales and marketing and R&D and [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3452.8199999999997s)]
*  G&A aren't going in there, I mean, I don't know why you go all the way to 30. I guess I'm just [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3458.66s)]
*  saying that I still think software businesses and marketplaces for that matter are still the best [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3463.7s)]
*  kinds of businesses on a margin profile basis. The problem is that there's a lot of fake [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3469.22s)]
*  software businesses or fake marketplaces out there that are pretending to be pure tech businesses [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3474.9s)]
*  when actually they're more like old school businesses that have the veneer of technology. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3480.26s)]
*  And I think to your point, they're like the trick of saying I'm an 80% gross margin business, [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3485.86s)]
*  but having no profitability is then who cares? So when you look at the profit, when you look at [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3491.78s)]
*  the profitability of these businesses, again, you'll be in the 20 to 30%. That's why when you [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3497.94s)]
*  see companies that are in the high 30s to low 50s, they're A, very unique, and B, you should [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3502.74s)]
*  expect that there is something fundamentally monopolistic about them. And that is the simplest [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3511.62s)]
*  way to filter out these companies because in a highly competitive market, you cannot extract [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3518.58s)]
*  those kinds of profit dollars. Capitalism says you can't do that. So you can only do it when [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3523.22s)]
*  you have an N of one or N of two kind of competitive dynamic where there's essentially [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3528.66s)]
*  a mutual to talk with your biggest competitor. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3533.46s)]
*  Yeah, it is a good point that just because you have good unit economics or good gross margins [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3536.3399999999997s)]
*  doesn't mean that the business is profitable at the end of the day. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3541.7799999999997s)]
*  It's good. Yeah, it could be totally crap. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3544.66s)]
*  I mean, you can have 80% gross margins and still be losing a ton of money because you've got too [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3545.8599999999997s)]
*  much overhead, you've got too much sales and marketing, you've got too much R&D. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3549.62s)]
*  Too much churn. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3553.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3553.7s)]
*  So you're selling to customers who don't really need it and then they eventually can't do it. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3554.18s)]
*  And then they eventually cancel, right? Like we see that a lot. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3557.94s)]
*  Look at the streamers. Look at the streamers. That's just a big recycling exercise. It's just [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3560.58s)]
*  like people come to the top of the funnel, they use the product, and then they leave. And then you [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3565.2200000000003s)]
*  have to reacquire them over and over again. And it could be the case that SaaS actually looks a [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3569.14s)]
*  little bit like that too at the bottom line level. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3573.38s)]
*  But when you hit your natural audience, it does get challenging. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3575.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3578.02s)]
*  Well, this is why in SaaS, there's a heuristic called the rule of 40, which is for public market [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3578.34s)]
*  SaaS companies, you want to see that their operating margin plus their growth rate equals [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3584.5s)]
*  40 or is greater than 40 ideally. So in other words, you could have a SaaS business with a 20% [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3590.74s)]
*  operating margin and a 20% growth rate and that would hit rule of 40 and that would be a very [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3597.78s)]
*  attractive business. Or you could have, I don't know, it could be growing 50% year over year [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3602.34s)]
*  and its operating margin could be negative 10%. And that'd be okay too because they're losing [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3608.74s)]
*  money, but at least the investment is leading to a well above average growth. Or you could be [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3613.86s)]
*  growing slower. You could have a 10% growth rate and have a 30% operating margin and that would [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3622.42s)]
*  also be hitting the rule of 40. So it's just a simple way of tracking whether this is a good [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3626.9s)]
*  business at scale. I don't think startups have to worry about this until they get to the later [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3633.78s)]
*  growth stage. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3638.26s)]
*  Yeah. When you're in your BC round, you're making 50, 100 million. Yeah, you got to be really [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3638.98s)]
*  thoughtful about this in the beginning of trying to get product market fit and triangulate on [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3643.14s)]
*  something. So Chamath just mentioned streaming, NBC universal, if you didn't know it paid the [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3646.2599999999998s)]
*  NFL a hundred million dollars for the exclusive streaming rights to one, that's right, one first [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3652.02s)]
*  round playoff game for the NFL. That happened last weekend between the chiefs and the dolphins. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3658.18s)]
*  That was on their service Peacock, NBC's app, basically their version of Netflix or Disney plus. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3663.14s)]
*  It guarded 23 million viewers, which makes it the most streamed live event in U S history. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3669.38s)]
*  Even so that's almost half of what the Packers and Cowboys had about 40 million lines versus Rams [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3674.98s)]
*  same weekend, 36 million. And so this has brought into question what's going on with streaming. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3684.58s)]
*  Have these businesses gotten ahead of their skis? Just to give you a couple of charts, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3690.5s)]
*  Disney plus took off like a massive rocket peaked in Q4 of 2022 at 164 million subscribers [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3694.1s)]
*  are now at 150 million. Here's a chart. I mean, just amazing how quickly they got to Netflix [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3701.38s)]
*  ish numbers. Here's Netflix's chart. Again, this is quarterly, they're up to now an all time high, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3707.94s)]
*  247 million subscribers and the annual growth rate all the way back to 2001. Still pretty [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3713.94s)]
*  spectacular and their revenue also very respectable for Netflix. However, they overspent [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3720.18s)]
*  massively during the peak streaming era 2019 to 2022. And that's when subscriber growth started [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3727.62s)]
*  too slow. Obviously, they were spending way too much and other entrants came in like Apple plus [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3733.7s)]
*  and Amazon prime where they really didn't even think that they had to make a profit. They were [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3739.7s)]
*  using streaming maybe to sell more iPhones or to get more Amazon prime subscribers. So here is the [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3744.18s)]
*  major problem. Here's the churn chart. Basically churn means people cancel, right? And so as these [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3751.3799999999997s)]
*  services have cut what they're offering, the number of Marvel shows or Disney, you know, [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3757.46s)]
*  having Star Wars shows, the churn goes way up. People are also having subscription overload. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3763.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't know how many of these I subscribe to, but I think it's all of them. Or maybe out of these [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3769.7799999999997s)]
*  123456789 on the chart, I think I have seven of these. So there is definitely some unbelievable [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3774.3399999999997s)]
*  subscription burnout and the streamers in order to get these businesses above water have raised [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3782.8199999999997s)]
*  their prices. We all know that you've probably seen your streaming bills, you know, have three, [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3788.8199999999997s)]
*  four or five bucks added to them every month. And at the same time, they're cutting how much [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3792.3399999999997s)]
*  they're spending. So you're paying more for last month your thoughts on this dynamic. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3796.18s)]
*  If you bring the chart back up, here's the most important thing that's worth noting. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3800.66s)]
*  Let's take stars as an example. It turns 12% of their users every month, which means that over [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3805.3799999999997s)]
*  a year they've turned 144% of their user base. That means that they have to basically turn their [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3810.58s)]
*  entire membership base one and a half times in order just to tread water. Right? So if you start [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3817.22s)]
*  with 100, it's a lot of money that you have to spend to make sure you end the year at 100. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3824.18s)]
*  Forget about growing. If you look at Peacock, they're going to lose 100% of their subscribers [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3830.5s)]
*  in a year. If you look at Discovery, they're going to lose 75%. If you look at Max, they're [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3836.98s)]
*  going to lose 50 odd percent. Apple TV, same. Hulu and Disney Plus will lose 60%. Netflix will lose [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3844.5s)]
*  almost 40%. So the only winner in all of this is Facebook and Google. The only winners are [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3853.22s)]
*  Facebook and Google because that's where the ads will appear to try to reacquire these folks. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3860.5s)]
*  Right? So I guess that's a positive indication. But the reality is that money isn't infinite. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3865.7s)]
*  And so what happens in a dynamic where you have a category where there's just a lot of consumer [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3871.7799999999997s)]
*  churn? I think what happens is it evolves in phases. And in phase one, which is sort of where [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3876.4199999999996s)]
*  we are now, where there's a bunch of relatively well established folks, is that they are going [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3881.3s)]
*  to initially overspend on content because they are going to try to differentiate the cost of [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3886.98s)]
*  acquisition based on content. Right? Which makes sense. I have a tent pole, come and watch it here. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3892.98s)]
*  You can't watch it anywhere else. And I think that was the Peacock example, where they had [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3898.02s)]
*  this football game and all these people showed up. And they thought this is exactly why we're [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3902.98s)]
*  paying so much money for these rights because people will show up. I think the problem is [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3907.46s)]
*  that when everybody is doing it, everybody's doing it. And so you don't know how to differentiate [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3912.98s)]
*  even in our group chat. Look at the number of times when somebody randomly says, is there [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3919.46s)]
*  something to watch and everybody's got 50 recommendations? Guess what I do? I tune it [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3923.54s)]
*  all out because I'm like 50 across six different services. I have no way to track it. And then I [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3927.62s)]
*  lose interest and I'm like, you know, I'll just stick to YouTube. So I think what happens is in [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3934.18s)]
*  phase one, folks spend a lot of content in phase two, they realize that actually what you need to [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3939.2999999999997s)]
*  do is spend on a long tail of content in a much more disciplined way. So there's a company that [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3946.58s)]
*  that I know about, for example, they just signed a pretty big deal with Amazon, hundreds of millions [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3951.7799999999997s)]
*  of dollars. And I was trying to figure out is that a lot or a little? And it turns out that Amazon's [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3960.34s)]
*  trying to get three or four or five versions of these going, which means that before we probably [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3967.6200000000003s)]
*  could have gotten five or 600 million and instead you get two or 300 million. Still an incredible [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3973.78s)]
*  thing, but it just goes to show you that there's a lot of competition. And so instead of having [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3978.5s)]
*  a single mode, right, if you were to graph something, where there's a few pieces that just [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3984.02s)]
*  get all the money, now you're smearing this content across all kinds of stuff. And I think that that [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3988.18s)]
*  makes it very difficult to keep folks. So I suspect that you're just going to see a lot of churn. I [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=3995.06s)]
*  don't like this category at all as an investor. Clearly there's been an overspend here, but [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4000.9s)]
*  consolidation is coming. Freeberg, any thoughts on the streaming space? I just think this is the [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4005.62s)]
*  opposite of what we were talking about earlier, where there's a free market competing and it's [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4010.8199999999997s)]
*  benefiting consumers. I mean, the point that you made is a really good one, that there's a lot of [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4015.14s)]
*  great content to watch. Folks that raise prices, people cancel. So you got to drop prices, you got [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4019.54s)]
*  to offer good content. And I actually think this is a really good and healthy thing to see happen [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4025.14s)]
*  is competition that benefits consumers. And there'll be some set of winners here and some [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4031.22s)]
*  set of losers. But I think ultimately, it's just really good to see this, how it all shakes out, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4035.06s)]
*  who's willing to put up the big bucks, who's got the smarter algorithm that predicts how fresh your [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4040.34s)]
*  content has to be and how unique it has to be relative to other platforms to keep the audience [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4045.5400000000004s)]
*  attention. I would argue if you look at those numbers and you look at the performance over time, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4050.34s)]
*  Netflix absolutely rules the roof in the sense they're an incredible operating team. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4054.5800000000004s)]
*  They have an incredible capability of predicting what content will work, how quickly they have to [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4058.5s)]
*  refresh content, how much they should be investing in content per quarter, per month. And they're [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4063.2200000000003s)]
*  clearly retaining users and making money. And others maybe that are newer to the game haven't [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4067.46s)]
*  figured that out yet. But it's just very good to see the competition. So I don't know how to predict [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4072.1s)]
*  what's going to happen here. But it's good to see. It's clearly going to be massive consolidation. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4075.94s)]
*  Also, these folks are launching advertising based versions. So you probably saw Netflix has an [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4079.2200000000003s)]
*  advertising tier. And so a lot of these folks didn't have those Disney Plus, I think is going [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4084.02s)]
*  to have one as well. You know, what no one's paying attention to is YouTube TV. I don't know, [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4088.7400000000002s)]
*  you guys subscribe to YouTube TV? I'm a Hulu person. Yeah, I think it's fantastic. If you look [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4094.02s)]
*  at some third party data on YouTube TV, the subscriptions are going through the friggin roof. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4098.98s)]
*  And it's really interesting to see because with YouTube TV, you're basically rebundling the [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4103.7s)]
*  unbundling that happened in cable, except you're doing it over the internet, you can access it [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4108.26s)]
*  anywhere. So they've basically converted the pipe as the value to the service itself as the value [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4112.34s)]
*  which you can access anywhere you want on any TV in any room without boxes, while you're on the road [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4117.46s)]
*  on your phone on your laptop. And it seems to be kind of highlighting that maybe it wasn't [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4122.02s)]
*  necessarily the bundling that was the problem, but the way that the service was being offered. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4127.700000000001s)]
*  So who knows maybe bundling versus all of this part and parcel, you got to pick five different [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4133.3s)]
*  providers and buy content on the fly. Maybe that's not what consumers want. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4137.780000000001s)]
*  Young people don't care about the live channels. Old people do. But yeah, Hulu and YouTube TV are [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4141.700000000001s)]
*  really wonderful products because they work really well on Apple TV. The apps work great, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4147.7s)]
*  but they also work great on your iPhone, your iPad. So, you know, they're really spectacular [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4152.42s)]
*  in that way. Sax? Well, this is a tie this conversation back to what you're talking about [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4157.3s)]
*  with margins and SaaS and tech enabled versus real software businesses. I personally have never seen [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4162.5s)]
*  a B2C subscription business that works. The churn is just too high. I mean, what I've seen is that [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4169.38s)]
*  the monthly churn rates on a software subscription for consumers is somewhere in the five to 10% [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4176.02s)]
*  range. So on a full year basis, you're attaining maybe 50% of your customer base. You're effectively [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4181.780000000001s)]
*  rebuilding your business from scratch every two years. It's a very tough place to be. This is why [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4187.22s)]
*  I basically skewed towards B2B SaaS is because a good B2B SaaS business will have net expansion. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4191.700000000001s)]
*  Instead of 50% churn, you'll do 120% expansion. And so you're actually building a subscriber base [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4199.14s)]
*  with long-term value. Now, how did Netflix do it? I mean, Netflix avoided that prohibitive level [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4205.54s)]
*  of churn by spending literally billions of dollars on content and original programming. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4211.62s)]
*  And again, it goes back to the point this is not a pure software, pure tech business. It includes [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4217.06s)]
*  an old school studio, which is very capital intensive. And they financed a lot of the [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4223.54s)]
*  content acquisition with billions and billions of dollars raised during that ZERP period from, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4232.1s)]
*  I think, both equity and debt. And you have to wonder if that could be done again in this [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4237.700000000001s)]
*  post ZERP period where capital is just a lot scarcer. I think this is going to work really [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4243.860000000001s)]
*  well though for Netflix and Disney. Man, these huge archives that they own, these libraries [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4248.5s)]
*  are going to get them to three, four, 500 million global subs and has become money printing machines [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4252.660000000001s)]
*  that I don't think they're going to need a ton of new content. The question is whether you could [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4258.5s)]
*  recreate an archive of that level today, given how much more expensive capital is. My point is [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4262.58s)]
*  that ZERP helped Netflix catch up to these studios and create this huge library. But still, I think [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4268.18s)]
*  that what the streaming services have shown in their churn is that if you don't provide original [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4274.18s)]
*  content and original programming, then users will churn off that. So you have to kind of have both. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4279.54s)]
*  You kind of have the library as filler. But if you don't have a hot show come along every so often, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4286.34s)]
*  the subscribers will churn off that. Yeah, you need to have some new content, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4293.22s)]
*  depending on how deep the library is. It feels like Netflix and Disney Plus have done a great [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4296.5s)]
*  job with their libraries, just to give you an idea. Revenue for Netflix for 2023, $33.5 billion, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4299.7s)]
*  $247 million subs. That's ARPU yearly revenue for those folks, $136 a year. Now, the reason you're [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4307.46s)]
*  seeing that number not make sense if you're paying $15 a month is because internationally, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4315.38s)]
*  Netflix is a lot, lot cheaper. But I love those two businesses. I think they're going to be [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4320.42s)]
*  extraordinary over time. Netflix has to acquire 100 million people a year just to stay even. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4325.38s)]
*  What's their churn rate? 4% a month. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4332.74s)]
*  I think it's fine. Right. So they're churning half their customer base every year. That's my point. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4335.06s)]
*  100 million people. They're rebuilding their customer base from scratch every two years. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4339.7s)]
*  How does that make sense? It's totally fine because what happens is you have [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4345.3s)]
*  people coming off their parents plan, getting their own people go through a bad beat. They [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4349.0599999999995s)]
*  don't like it, you know, whatever they unsubscribe, but they all come back, back and forth, back and [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4353.7s)]
*  forth. And then it just keeps growing over time. I think you're describing something that's true. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4357.86s)]
*  I think David is describing why it's a shit business. I mean, if they, if they make more [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4363.38s)]
*  money than they spend, and I don't think they need to do a ton of advertising. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4368.82s)]
*  Eventually, you turn through so much of the market that actually you can't maintain that [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4372.259999999999s)]
*  growth rate. I mean, if you reactivate, maybe you can do it. But I think that's what's happening. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4376.74s)]
*  From a business perspective, the only logical thing that I would do if I was running one of [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4382.099999999999s)]
*  these businesses is attach it to another business where you can think about it in terms of LTV. So [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4387.219999999999s)]
*  the only obvious example of that, I think, is Amazon video, because you can stick it beside [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4393.62s)]
*  prime and a bunch of other things. And now you have a very different way of justifying [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4398.98s)]
*  LTV and minimizing churn. And that seems like a I buy that argument, Jason, I don't buy like [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4404.5s)]
*  a standalone business like this trying to do it. Yucky. I'm sorry, real quick, have you guys dug [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4410.18s)]
*  into Netflix's business? I mean, they're still growing top line, the EBITDA margin continues [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4415.7s)]
*  to expand. I mean, all those facts might be true. But that churn engine and that recapture engine [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4421.38s)]
*  seems to be working in a way that they're printing cash and growing. It's pretty impressive. I don't [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4426.26s)]
*  know if there's a limit there. But I mean, I haven't looked at the analyst. I think that is the key. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4431.3s)]
*  To the bundling point, Apple Plus, which is the TV component, not the hardware product, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4436.26s)]
*  is bundled as part of this Apple One program, which is kind of like Amazon Prime. And so I [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4442.42s)]
*  think you're seeing a little bundling there. Netflix also added video games to make it even [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4447.14s)]
*  more sticky. So I think there's like a subscription super app coming, which the New York Times has [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4451.46s)]
*  kind of done right with Wordle, Crosswords, the athletic wire cutter and the New York Times. So [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4456.42s)]
*  I think you're going to start to see. Honestly, you just had a jumble of names that went in one [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4461.46s)]
*  year and out the other. I don't remember a single one you said. This is my point for most people, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4465.9400000000005s)]
*  Jason, not at a media aficionado like New York Times is doing fantastic doing this bundling. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4469.62s)]
*  Some people come for the crosswords and wordle and that's why they subscribe and they like the [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4474.1s)]
*  news. Other people come for the news, they discover crosswords and wire cutter and the athletic and [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4477.620000000001s)]
*  they stay for that. So I do think there's going to be an incredible business here. I'll take the [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4481.540000000001s)]
*  other side of it. Yeah, they spent a lot on content though, during that period where Disney Plus came [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4485.9400000000005s)]
*  in, I think everybody's now has a little more discipline and the budgets came way down. If [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4491.3s)]
*  you didn't know the Hulk cost 250 million or something, the she Hulk rather that cost 225 [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4495.860000000001s)]
*  million for nine episodes. What first vendors 225 million. Wait, sorry, 250 250 million for [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4501.38s)]
*  nine episodes of the she helped. And people criticize it for having bad CGI. So it's I [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4507.06s)]
*  think there's like new discipline coming to us. Is this a Netflix show? A Disney Plus show, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4512.66s)]
*  a Disney Plus show. Yeah, I don't know about you guys. I've been rewatching the Sopranos. I [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4516.42s)]
*  find some of the content on HBO Max to be the best content out there. Oh my God. I've watched [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4520.34s)]
*  it so much. My watchability on it. Disney doesn't have that much rewatchability. I don't know. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4524.66s)]
*  The only reason I keep my max description is because I'm waiting for House of the Dragon season [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4528.74s)]
*  two. I mean, if they didn't have that one show, I'd be like, yeah, kind of, you know, yeah, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4532.9s)]
*  I do think this could help Netflix because a lot of these streaming services came along. We had way [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4537.46s)]
*  too many, right? We got saturated with streaming services. And most of them you subscribe to, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4542.42s)]
*  you may not even remember subscribing. You may just subscribe to a free trial to get an NFL game. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4547.7s)]
*  And then you get billed because you forgot to cancel it. By the way. Yeah. Have you guys ever [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4552.82s)]
*  gone into Apple iCloud settings and looked at your subscriptions? Oh boy. Yeah. Get in there. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4557.78s)]
*  Guys, just go. If you have like an extra five minutes, you will save so much money [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4565.46s)]
*  by going into subscriptions in your settings and just turning them all off. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4572.5s)]
*  I was shocked. I was shocked. I mean, this is part of your austerity measure. Absolutely. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4576.5s)]
*  You know how many subscriptions to Disney Plus I had? How many? This is what's so gross is why [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4580.5s)]
*  they even let me do this. I had three. What? Three. How's it even possible? One for the plane, [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4585.3s)]
*  one for the kids. I had three. I had three. I had two HBOs. I had two Netflix. Oh no, Netflix keeps [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4595.14s)]
*  sending you a message saying, Hey, you need to update your payment information. But then I'm [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4603.3s)]
*  watching Netflix on my Apple TV. So I'm like, I'm clearly paying for it somehow. It's so confusing [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4607.46s)]
*  I have the perfect solution for you. There are credit cards now where you can set a spending [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4615.78s)]
*  limit. And so what I do is every year I just turn off the limit on that credit card. I just [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4620.179999999999s)]
*  take it from unlimited or uncapped down to zero. And I do this for business as well. And then all [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4626.34s)]
*  the subscriptions time out. You know what I call that? What? Jeff. Jeff does that for me. Jeff. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4630.42s)]
*  But I mean, having somebody go in there, I have a Jeff. I have a Jeff. You know, but it's very [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4637.0599999999995s)]
*  simple. You only use one card for subscriptions and then you turn it off every year. Which one [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4641.7s)]
*  you want to keep going. It works really well. And then you move the other ones to a new card. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4645.139999999999s)]
*  I don't even want to say how many thousands of dollars I was wasting on like [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4648.66s)]
*  Duolingo. I was like, I'm paying for Duolingo. And then I was paying for- [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4651.86s)]
*  And your Italian is still terrible. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4655.62s)]
*  Yeah, terrible. And then I had- [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4657.46s)]
*  I think you have a case against them. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4658.82s)]
*  No, then I had Duolingo and I had Babel and I had Rosetta Stone. So I'm like, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4660.26s)]
*  my Italian is not improving because of any of these three apps, but I was paying them collectively, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4665.38s)]
*  like $400. I had a whoop subscription. I don't even have a whoop. When Rick Thompson started [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4669.3s)]
*  Manscaped, I signed up for Manscaped. I get all this ball deodorant. I've never used it once. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4675.62s)]
*  We know. We know. We sit next to you in poker. We know. It's not working, bro. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4681.62s)]
*  Just a message to Manscaped. I have tried to cancel. I have called, I have emailed. I took [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4686.66s)]
*  it upon myself to try. It's impossible to cancel. They won't even let you reset your account so you [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4691.78s)]
*  can get a link to cancel. It's so hard. And still your balls are terrible. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4697.22s)]
*  My balls are phenomenal. I've sat next to you in poker, man. Not in real- [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4703.780000000001s)]
*  Okay. Let's get into plastics and get off Chamath balls. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4707.54s)]
*  I mean, how did we get here? Subscription services. Subscription services. Yes. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4712.26s)]
*  Streaming is at a crosswords. Crosswords apparently. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4717.9400000000005s)]
*  They're really trying to make that ball deodorant happen, aren't they? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4722.26s)]
*  They're trying to make it happen. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4725.06s)]
*  They're trying to make fetch happen. Ball deodorant is not happening. I'm sorry. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4726.34s)]
*  I mean, what are you supposed to do? Squat and swipe? How does it work? Is it a spray? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4729.46s)]
*  Are you lifting and spraying? Is it a jet? [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4734.74s)]
*  You gotta give them points for creativity, trying to create like a new thing. But yeah. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4736.900000000001s)]
*  I was trying to support my friend in signing up for a subscription service, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4740.74s)]

*  Could you also take a shower and use soap? I don't know. Just putting it out there. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4748.18s)]
*  I'm trying. It doesn't have to do with the product. I signed up because Rick [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4752.82s)]
*  was the venture investor that seeded it and started. I supported my friend. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4758.18s)]
*  Yes. And now I want out and I cannot get out. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4762.5s)]
*  Every time I try to get out, they pull me back in. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4766.74s)]
*  I'm just going to say when it comes to Manscaped, no testimonials, please. No testimonials. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4769.14s)]
*  The worst part is like, you know, it comes to the house and. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4773.7s)]
*  Oh, somebody opens your ball deodorant and puts it on your desk. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4777.7s)]
*  Do they know they know you have sticky balls? [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4780.98s)]
*  Well, that's what's so funny. They put it right on the kitchen counter. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4784.179999999999s)]
*  So as I walk through the everybody, I grab it and I'm like, who's seen this bottle? [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4786.58s)]
*  Oh, there it is. What is it? [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4792.82s)]
*  There is bottles. Shaking all the other. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4794.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, my God. Oh, man. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4803.3s)]
*  How do you apply it? Is it just a little dabble? Do you know? [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4805.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's not a spray. It's apparently an ointment, sex. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4808.5s)]
*  It's an ointment. Far too much information. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4811.78s)]
*  Yeah, I'll try it. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4815.06s)]

*  Freiburg, it's your turn to shine. No, not ball deodorant. We wanted to talk about micro plastics. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4851.54s)]
*  A study came out. It's terrifying. We've known plastics have been terrible for years. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4857.22s)]
*  I was turned into some sort of political discourse with straws and everything. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4861.14s)]
*  But plastics are horrible. We shouldn't be using them. But this study confirms a bunch [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4865.38s)]
*  about drinking micro plastics educate us on this study that everybody's talking about right now. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4869.54s)]
*  Dr. Friedberg, I wouldn't start with the statement that plastics are awful. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4876.26s)]
*  Plastics are polymers, which are long chains of what are called monomers. This is hydrogen, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4881.86s)]
*  carbon and oxygen that comes together to form these specific molecules. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4887.38s)]
*  And then we can kind of bake them into crystal like structures. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4892.34s)]
*  And the reason the plastic industry took off is because it ended up being very cheap to create [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4896.1s)]
*  materials that we could turn into chairs that we could turn into bottles to move stuff around. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4900.34s)]
*  A lot of applications, everything from solar photovoltaics to our computers, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4904.74s)]
*  to our laptops, to our phones, everything has some form of these polymers in it. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4909.38s)]
*  The polymers that are commonly used for making bottles that we consume beverages out of are [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4915.22s)]
*  PET plastics. These PET plastics are made from a combination of natural gas and crude oil. So we [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4921.14s)]
*  kind of have a production process where we get the carbon, hydrogen and oxygen that's naturally found [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4928.42s)]
*  in natural gas and crude oil, convert it into these molecules that we turn into long chains, [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4934.5s)]
*  and we turn them into bottles and fill those bottles. And they end up being [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4939.22s)]
*  a lower carbon footprint than using glass, about 5X the carbon footprint to use glass instead of [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4943.62s)]
*  plastic and making a bottle to store stuff and move liquids around. 40% cheaper and a lot of [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4951.94s)]
*  other kind of reasons why the industry and the world adopted plastics, not just for bottle [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4959.38s)]
*  beverages, but for other applications. So in bottle beverages, because these are polymers, [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4964.099999999999s)]
*  there are these long chains of little molecules that are stuck together. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4968.74s)]
*  Some of those chains break and then some of those little chunks of those molecules end [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4972.58s)]
*  up floating around in the liquid that we're consuming. And what this study did that kind [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4976.82s)]
*  of highlighted a set of data that hadn't really been studied well before is they used a form of [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4982.26s)]
*  spectroscopy. So kind of a multi-spectral light system, shining light at different wavelengths [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4987.86s)]
*  on the liquid in a bottle, in a plastic bottle, to figure out how many of these little plastic [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4993.86s)]
*  particles there were in the liquid. And in doing that, they found that there was on the order [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=4998.42s)]
*  of 10,000 little plastic particles per liter of water or per liter of soda or drink or Gatorade [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5004.0199999999995s)]
*  or whatever the beverages that you're drinking. The real question then is, well, how risky is that? [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5010.74s)]
*  So if you look at a lot of the health agency studies, the kind of well adopted and well [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5015.0599999999995s)]
*  researched efforts on is there toxicity associated with PET plastics on its own? [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5022.900000000001s)]
*  They find that there's very little genotoxicity or no genotoxicity, meaning it doesn't change your DNA. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5027.7s)]
*  There's no carcinogenicities, it doesn't cause cancer. But there are other studies recently [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5032.900000000001s)]
*  that have shown different mechanisms by which these little tiny microplastics might end up [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5038.900000000001s)]
*  in your cells, because they absorb into your body and they're small enough that they can cross into [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5043.46s)]
*  barriers. They can get into your brain, they can get into your cells when they're in your cells. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5048.02s)]
*  There are other mechanistic studies that are done in a Petri dish, as opposed to being studied in [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5052.34s)]
*  the body, where they've demonstrated that they can actually disrupt the function of organelles [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5056.660000000001s)]
*  like mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, all these little things that operate in your cell, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5060.580000000001s)]
*  they can cause irritation, they can trigger chemicals to be produced that might cause allergies, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5065.14s)]
*  that might cause inflammation, and so on and so forth. So while the general molecule of PET itself [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5070.26s)]
*  isn't known or shown in any way to cause cancer or to cause changes in your DNA, there are other [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5076.42s)]
*  mechanisms by which these little tiny plastics might be disrupting cellular function, might be [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5082.1s)]
*  causing other health issues. And that's now going to open up a big area of research that's going to [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5086.42s)]
*  be predicated, I think, on the fact that this study now shows that there are thousands, hundreds of [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5092.34s)]
*  thousands of little pieces of tiny plastic in these plastic bottles that we're drinking water [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5097.38s)]
*  and soda and juice from that are getting into our body and into our cells. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5101.7s)]
*  240,000 little pieces in the average one liter plastic bottle. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5104.98s)]
*  That's a pretty scary statistic. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5110.9s)]
*  When you hear that number. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5112.9s)]
*  And small enough to cross the blood brain barrier. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5113.46s)]
*  Right. And in rats and mice, they've shown that these little microplastics can actually [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5116.0199999999995s)]
*  accumulate in the brain if they consume enough of them. Now, the reason this hasn't been well [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5121.94s)]
*  understood or studied in the past is we kind of look at the aggregate amount of plastic that's [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5126.259999999999s)]
*  in a liquid. And it's like, oh, the amount is so small, it doesn't matter. But when you start to [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5130.339999999999s)]
*  look at how small these little pieces of plastic are, and add them up the cumulative effect over [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5134.58s)]
*  time, that they can actually cross into cells cross the blood brain barrier, maybe are not getting [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5140.1s)]
*  removed from the body. That's opening up a whole lot of research, because there's no easy way to [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5144.98s)]
*  just scan a body and say, is there plastic in it? How much plastic is there? Because there isn't a [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5149.0599999999995s)]
*  good chemical signature for it. And what these guys did is they use light to look in the liquid [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5153.14s)]
*  to find the plastics, which we can't easily do in the body today. So Freyberg, are you going to [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5158.18s)]
*  drink plastic bottle water anymore? I'm not. Okay, Jamal, I've already stopped this started for me [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5162.1s)]
*  about four months ago. My wife basically said we're getting rid of all plastic. And at first, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5168.26s)]
*  I really pushed back and I'm like, this is crazy. And she just kept talking to me about it and [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5173.14s)]
*  showing me all this data. And yeah, about a month ago, I would say I switched. So now use glass and [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5178.26s)]
*  craft like this. Yeah, much better. We got rid of all of the plastic in our in our house in the gym, [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5185.46s)]
*  no more bottles. It's wasteful anyway. Like why not if you have beautiful filtered water at home, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5190.82s)]
*  put it in a craft? Sure. But the scary thing, I mean, it's a little bit more inconvenient, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5195.46s)]
*  I'll be honest with you. But it is very scary. And I think that it does alter the phenotype [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5200.74s)]
*  of the human body over time. And I think you'd have to be insane to bet against that. And I suspect [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5206.9s)]
*  when you look at the rates of depression and autism and Alzheimer's and dementia and autoimmune [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5214.259999999999s)]
*  diseases, Crohn's rheumatoid arthritis, to think that all of these environmental factors [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5219.3s)]
*  have no impact, I think is is taking a very scary bet. Here's what I do. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5224.9800000000005s)]
*  I buy these glass bottles on Amazon, you know, two or three cases of them, I have the best [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5230.42s)]
*  water filter system at home. We fill them, we put them in the refrigerator, and we haven't bought [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5235.22s)]
*  plastic in years. Wow, in years in years, only because I care about the environment, because [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5240.42s)]
*  I'm a good person. Yeah, Jason, I'll also say like that that application is a pretty small, [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5246.98s)]
*  like, I think on the order, if I'm right, 80% of bottle beverages are drunk outside the home. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5253.78s)]
*  So people are buying stuff at convenience stores at gas stations at markets, taking them with them [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5258.74s)]
*  to work. And that's how a lot of plastic bottles are consumed. Remember, I have such a small [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5264.82s)]
*  percentage of the global population, you go to Africa, you go to Brazil, you go to China, [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5271.219999999999s)]
*  there isn't a great like, people don't have these amenities that we have in our upper and middle [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5275.46s)]
*  class America, that plastic bottles have provided access to products that consumers around the world [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5279.7s)]
*  otherwise wouldn't be able to afford. So there's a reason they exist. But by the way, I also want [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5285.62s)]
*  to just be really clear, there isn't conclusive evidence or science that shows these plastic [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5289.86s)]
*  microparticles or nanoparticles are causing these health effects. There's certainly a lot of [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5294.9800000000005s)]
*  questions that it brings on, well, what is the cumulative effect of these little things getting [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5299.86s)]
*  into cells? Do they get into cells? Why would anybody bet that it's zero? [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5303.3s)]
*  Right. So that's the reason. What is the upside? Right. Well, the upside is that people get to [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5308.26s)]
*  access cheap beverages on the street that otherwise people that are living on $13,000 a year [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5311.860000000001s)]
*  that can buy a plastic soda for 25 cents. You can also buy water in a can though. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5316.5s)]
*  Yeah. So that's definitely an alternative. They're a little more expensive generally. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5323.22s)]
*  Plastic just became the cheapest container. Sax, your thoughts. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5326.42s)]
*  Sorry, guys, I stepped out to get a drink here. Did I miss anything? [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5329.46s)]
*  It would be better if you had put a straw in your water bottle and we're drinking [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5336.5s)]
*  from a plastic bottle to a plastic straw. Now I understand your level of depression. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5340.42s)]
*  It's actually just killing those arrow water bottles. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5346.34s)]
*  Yeah. Did I miss something? [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5349.7s)]
*  There's a science corner. I stepped out. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5351.62s)]
*  Also, I use these beautiful contigo setting. Some people use yetis or other kind of things. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5353.06s)]
*  And I actually carry them with me only because I try to like think about the environment, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5359.9400000000005s)]
*  just the amount of plaques is being created. I don't know if you've seen this, but like you [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5365.06s)]
*  go to Whole Foods now, or you go to any supermarket, and you see this wall of salads. Freiburg, like, [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5369.06s)]
*  this is unconscionable. Like, we're literally giving people salad in a giant plastic box. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5375.86s)]
*  Yeah, let me just say a couple things about this. Because there's this conception that this is just [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5384.42s)]
*  awful, awful, awful. But plastics, there is a degradation of these PETs when they're exposed [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5388.259999999999s)]
*  to sunlight. There is a recycling system that many of much of this material ends up in. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5393.7s)]
*  Much of it? Yeah, I mean, not a lot. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5399.38s)]
*  I don't think that's actually correct. Not a lot. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5401.62s)]
*  But what would the alternative be, right? So the alternative is you put it in glass [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5402.9s)]
*  thing and you charge people $15 for a couple pieces of lettuce. The reason the plastic industry [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5405.86s)]
*  emerged is because it provided a low cost way to transport materials. And that we're all very [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5411.7s)]
*  wealthy. So we have to just step outside of our bubble for a second and recognize that most people, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5417.219999999999s)]
*  you know, the dollar difference is a huge difference for most consumers, they're not going [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5421.86s)]
*  to make that dollar leap. So you know, the fact that plastics emerged is to support a consumer [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5425.86s)]
*  market that's grown up all over the world. Yeah, but how does this make sense? Look [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5430.5s)]
*  at these bananas, just as an example, to give people an idea, bananas already come with a case [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5433.86s)]
*  called that's crazy. And they're literally wrapping bananas in plastic now. And you know, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5439.54s)]
*  I think this is where regulation makes sense. There must be a gas in here or something, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5445.94s)]
*  because they're trying to keep the bananas from going bad. That's why I want to shout out like, [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5450.339999999999s)]
*  this is where I think regulations actually do work. France, Spain, a lot of countries now are just [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5454.179999999999s)]
*  saying, you know, for fruits, vegetables, like, yeah, don't put them in plastic, please. We're [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5460.02s)]
*  not going to allow you to do that. And I think I'm not pro plastic, by the way, I'm not drinking [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5464.5s)]
*  plastic from plastic bottles. But we have to be cognizant of where this industry emerged from [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5468.900000000001s)]
*  what the science says about it. Like, I don't want to just be flipping about it. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5473.540000000001s)]
*  What is doing in the oceans? Freiburg is unconscionable. Like this, this is not like [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5478.42s)]
*  a do good or thing. It's just awful. There's no reason that we need to have plastics as a standard. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5482.900000000001s)]
*  I'll give you some good optimism around this. There's a lot of efforts right now to develop [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5487.54s)]
*  microbes that can actually biodegrade these PET plastics. So there's so we're engineering these [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5494.5s)]
*  microbes that will produce enzymes is a little bacteria that will produce enzymes, those enzymes [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5500.58s)]
*  can then be made in the plastic itself. So then the plastic will biodegrade within a year after [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5506.18s)]
*  you use it. So there's a lot of this kind of effort on how do you make naturally biodegrading [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5512.1s)]
*  plastics using bio sources and biological molecules as part of the production process. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5515.7s)]
*  And a lot of big plastic packaging companies and industrial biotech companies are investing in this [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5521.0599999999995s)]
*  area. This is where collectivism can do good. You know, like if we actually, as a society say, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5525.86s)]
*  we want to do sustainable packaging, like because of the tragedy of the commons, like you're saying, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5532.26s)]
*  Freiburg, because it's cheaper capitalism, like there's no floor here, you know, to stop people [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5536.179999999999s)]
*  from doing this and stop from using plastics unnecessarily, like wrapping bananas, etc. All [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5541.94s)]
*  right, listen, it's been an amazing episode of the all in podcast for the dictator. Wish me luck [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5547.139999999999s)]
*  today, boys. Wish me luck. Use the promo code dick. We'll be following the live stream on the chat. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5553.94s)]
*  Following the live stream, use promo code dick to get 20% off your ball deodorant. What do you guys [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5558.66s)]
*  think about actually like running some poker tournaments through the year called all in? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5563.62s)]
*  100% That would be super fun, no? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5568.42s)]
*  100% I think we can replace the WSOP pretty quick. I mean, it'd be pretty [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5571.62s)]
*  I'm not kidding. We have still Helmuth on our school. I think Jason's right. I'm not just Helmuth. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5576.9800000000005s)]
*  I think you can get all the pros because I think the problem is like those championships have been [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5583.46s)]
*  so watered down, right? There's 52 of them just in Vegas in June and July. And then now you have [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5587.7s)]
*  like these circuit rings. So now there's bracelets and rings. And then there's the European one, [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5594.74s)]
*  then there's this one, there's the Bahamas. You can't have I think in order to be a world champion, [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5599.46s)]
*  can you really have like 150 winners a year? Sacks, are you bored with Holden? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5606.34s)]
*  Well, I'll play with you guys. But yeah, I'm kind of bored with it. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5611.62s)]
*  Yeah, I played a tournament yesterday, Big O 37 players, I came in first. I don't know if you [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5615.38s)]
*  played where did you play? I had a speaking gig yesterday in LA. After the speaking gig, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5620.74s)]
*  I was going to the airport, I had a little time. And I just stopped by Hollywood Park where you [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5625.3s)]
*  stopped. You went to Hollywood Park. I wanted to see the new one. You're the best. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5629.62s)]
*  I don't know. There's nothing more boring than playing in a tournament with people you don't know. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5635.54s)]
*  Oh, it was great. It was great. There was like a fight broke out forever. I mean, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5640.26s)]
*  I did the WSOP a couple of times. And you know, I think I lasted like three days. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5643.86s)]
*  It's a long time to be playing poker. I got to the final table. And they wanted to chop and I [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5648.1s)]
*  was the short stack. I was like, well, you know, my flights in for in a couple hours, I'd rather [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5654.9800000000005s)]
*  not chop and this woman, I got in a fight at the casino almost, this woman was wearing a mask. And [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5658.740000000001s)]
*  she goes, this mother effer won't chop. And I said, ma'am, it's my option to not shop. Madam, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5664.34s)]
*  I said, ma'am, madam, whatever, they them. And she went crazy. And the floor came over said, [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5675.620000000001s)]
*  ma'am, you have to sit down. She called me a mother effort twice to my face. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5681.06s)]
*  You went on a way I was the short stack and I went on to win the tournament. I kid you're not. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5686.820000000001s)]
*  How much did you win 1400 bucks? So what is your hourly rate on that? You make like $14 an hour, [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5690.740000000001s)]
*  $100 buy in. So yeah, it was 200 bucks an hour. But here's what happened. So I had this guy [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5697.620000000001s)]
*  massively for seven hours, six hours. Maybe it was awesome. It was great. I was, I had the time of [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5702.5s)]
*  my life. It was the first time I played in a tournament for like, since we played the one drop [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5708.18s)]
*  that time, I haven't played in a tournament since then. It was so much fun. Jason goes from playing [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5712.26s)]
*  the hundred K by $100. I had a time of my life because I've never played big O before. It's [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5718.18s)]
*  where you have five cards and it was high low. It was so dynamic and big. Oh yeah. Big. Oh yeah. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG0dfz0r3eo&t=5724.5s)]
