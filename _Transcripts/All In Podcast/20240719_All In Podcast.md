# Trump assassination attempt, Secret Service failure, Inside the RNC, VC liquidity problem
**All In Podcast:** [July 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU)
*  All right, Tramoth, apparently the Rain Man, David Sacks is now the architect. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=0.0s)]
*  I think he's been working behind the scenes, according to a bunch of the news stories. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3.84s)]
*  I like Puppet Master. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=8.44s)]
*  The Puppet Master? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=9.84s)]
*  Okay, well, let's cut. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=10.84s)]
*  We should call Sacks Geppetto. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=11.84s)]
*  Let's cut. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=12.84s)]
*  We're going live now to the RNC in Milwaukee and live coverage. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=13.84s)]
*  Sith Lord, David Sacks, are you there? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=18.6s)]
*  Oh, there he is! [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=21.6s)]
*  It's Palpatine! [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=23.6s)]
*  Tell us about your new empire! [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=24.6s)]
*  The center of Palpatine! [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=27.6s)]
*  Everything has proceeded as I have foreseen. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=29.400000000000002s)]
*  Obviously Sacks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Trump makes his own decisions. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=51.8s)]
*  You're getting a little bit too much credit, I think. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=53.2s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=55.2s)]
*  I mean, I'm mocking, I'm satirizing the New York Times, the Business Insider, and all [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  these publications that are giving me all this credit. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=61.6s)]
*  Listen, the president obviously makes the decision. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  He solicits feedback from lots of people. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=65.72s)]
*  I was probably one of a thousand people, or at least hundreds of people, who offered my [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  opinion. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=71.88s)]
*  Obviously I'm a big fan of JD Vance, but I think it's just giving me way too much credit. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=72.88s)]
*  In all seriousness, Sacks, you're there and obviously, you know, President Trump, how [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=77.84s)]
*  is he doing? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=83.28s)]
*  How is he feeling in the wake of this absolute tragedy? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=84.36s)]
*  I think he's doing well. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=87.36s)]
*  He was in great spirits, I think. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=88.92s)]
*  But let's maybe we should get into the assassination attempt. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=90.88s)]
*  That's really the thing to talk about here. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=93.2s)]
*  All right, everybody. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=94.48s)]
*  Welcome back to episode 188 of the All In Podcast. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=95.48s)]
*  We have a full docket to get through today. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=100.4s)]
*  We are here on July 18th on the taping of this, and it is five days after an assassination [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=102.8s)]
*  attempt on the former president of the United States and the likely 47th president of the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=110.48s)]
*  United States, obviously President Trump. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  We're going to start with what we know. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  It's five days later. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=119.48s)]
*  We're a bit in the fog of war as it is, and there are all the breaking news caveats that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=120.48s)]
*  you can put on this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=126.2s)]
*  But I want to recap what we know now about this assassination attempt and get everybody's [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=127.2s)]
*  feedback on it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=132.32s)]
*  Last Saturday at a rally in Pennsylvania, a 20-year-old named Thomas Matthew Crooks [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=133.76s)]
*  fired eight rounds with an AR-15 at the former president. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=138.88s)]
*  One bullet nicked Trump's right ear. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=142.76s)]
*  This was confirmed by the president on Truth Social and a Trump supporter, tragically, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  in the crowd, Corey Comparatore, was killed while protecting his family from gunfire. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=150.64s)]
*  Two others were critically injured. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  Crooks was killed by the Secret Service's counter sniper team 26 seconds after he fired [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=158.28s)]
*  the first shot. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  He didn't have a criminal record. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=163.07999999999998s)]
*  He was not known to the FBI or Secret Service. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=164.8s)]
*  He was a registered Republican, but also donated $15 to a progressive PAC. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=168.18s)]
*  And the motive is not known, so we'll just wait for that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=173.38s)]
*  There were some leaks from a Senate briefing. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=178.3s)]
*  I don't know if you gentlemen have heard those. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=180.5s)]
*  That just came out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  And it was reported that Crooks wrote on July 13th on Steam. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=185.02s)]
*  That's a gaming platform. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=190.26s)]
*  July 13th will be my premiere watch as it unfolds. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=191.82s)]
*  He had a second phone. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=196.06s)]
*  He had a detonation device in his pocket. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=197.52s)]
*  There were bombs or some sort of explosive device in his car. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=200.08s)]
*  We'll get details of that, I'm sure. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=203.24s)]
*  And now we are in the phase of how the hell did this happen? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  Here's a picture of the rooftop. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=210.0s)]
*  The closest rooftop was not secured and it was 130 yards away. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=211.88s)]
*  The head of the Secret Service said they didn't put anybody on the rooftop because of its [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  sloped surface. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=222.56s)]
*  Obviously, this is being mocked on social media and questioned by journalists and anybody [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  with any IQ points. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=230.88s)]
*  The most disturbing part of all of this, aside from somebody wanting to murder the president, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  is the timeline. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=238.16s)]
*  So ABC News is reporting on the following timeline, gentlemen. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  510 PM, Crooks was first identified as a POI, Person of Interest, 530. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=243.44s)]
*  He's spotted with a rangefinder, 552. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=248.98s)]
*  He's spotted on a roof by the Secret Service, 602, Trump takes the stage, 612 PM. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=252.32s)]
*  He fires his first shot. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  We'll get into some clips and everything, but let me just stop here and get everybody's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=261.24s)]
*  reaction to this tragedy. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=266.1s)]
*  Jamath, your thoughts? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=268.68s)]
*  It's absolute insanity. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=270.96s)]
*  I actually just, I had just woken up because I was flying back to the United States for [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=273.71999999999997s)]
*  a board meeting. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=278.8s)]
*  And so as I was boarding and on the way, I was just on my way to the airport reading [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=281.48s)]
*  it mostly from our group chat. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=285.88s)]
*  And I was, I couldn't believe it, to be totally honest with you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=288.8s)]
*  I thought this made, I thought this is not possible in this day and age. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  And part of why I thought it was not possible was because I had elevated in my mind who [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=297.32s)]
*  the Secret Service were and that the job they did or that they're supposed to be doing [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=304.24s)]
*  is just so sacrosanct to the well-functioning of America that you only have the absolute [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=311.2s)]
*  best people doing that job. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=318.24s)]
*  And that job is to protect these handful of individuals in America, most importantly being [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=321.2s)]
*  the United States, the president of the United States, who are just critical to the functioning [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=326.76s)]
*  of the most important country in the world. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=330.96s)]
*  When you see the level of negligence and incompetence, you know, my mind started racing. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=335.8s)]
*  How is it even possible? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=344.16s)]
*  And I guess the only thing that I can come up with is that we need to figure out where [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=347.04s)]
*  incompetence ended and negligence began in all of this, because I think that's what's [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=356.32s)]
*  going to be the most critical. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=360.76s)]
*  And we need to figure out the totality of what happened and, you know, if there were [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=363.4s)]
*  other people that supported this guy trying to do this. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=368.4s)]
*  And then the second I'll just say is Trump is an absolute legend. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=372.64s)]
*  What a boss. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=376.23999999999995s)]
*  Okay, Freberg, where were you when the news broke? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=377.23999999999995s)]
*  And what are your general thoughts here five days after this occurred? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=380.32s)]
*  We'll get into political ramifications and everything else, but just on the event that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=383.4s)]
*  occurred and your takeaways from it. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=386.96s)]
*  I was with a group of people drinking beer outside. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=389.08s)]
*  We were on our fourth beer. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=392.04s)]
*  And I thought it was a joke. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=394.36s)]
*  I think the first thing I thought after I saw the video and saw that he was OK and that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=396.76s)]
*  his ear was bleeding was that's it, it's over. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=400.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump's won. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=402.6s)]
*  It was probably one of the most iconic patriotic visuals I think any of us have seen. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=403.92s)]
*  And here's the image next pulling up. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=411.52s)]
*  What a photo. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=413.12s)]
*  This is the AP photographer. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=414.16s)]
*  And I think it's really it was so striking. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=416.08s)]
*  You see this photo, which which didn't come out right away. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=418.72s)]
*  But some of the imagery that came out right away with him pumping his fist was like, OK, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=422.2s)]
*  that's it. Trump's won. It's over. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=425.04s)]
*  Second thing I thought was this could trigger a lot of violent counter reactions if it if [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=427.12s)]
*  Trump doesn't lead well here. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=434.08s)]
*  And I think he prevented that in his statements and from the other side. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=435.48s)]
*  Third thing I thought is it doesn't matter if Biden drops out now because it's over. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=440.64s)]
*  Biden could stay in. He could leave. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=444.2s)]
*  This just feels like a lot of momentum. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=446.68s)]
*  And then the fourth thing I thought was this to Chumov's point, I think we've all been [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=449.56s)]
*  around Secret Service people in our lives and in our careers and in meetings and interactions [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=452.64s)]
*  we've had, it really was amazing that the Secret Service let this happen. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=457.36s)]
*  And if you see. You know, all the data and the stuff that's coming out now about how [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  the Secret Service manage this, it seems pretty scary that this was so botched. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=467.0s)]
*  Certainly now the dust has settled five days later, and it seems like they're back into [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=471.24s)]
*  the conversation about let's remove Biden and figure out who can run against Trump. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=475.68s)]
*  Although there is conflicting polling data, which I know we're going to get to. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  Let's get to Sax's reaction. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=482.64s)]
*  Sax, where were you when this occurred and your thoughts on the event itself? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=483.88s)]
*  And obviously there's tons of conspiracy theories going around right now. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=490.28000000000003s)]
*  Obviously there is some negligence that occurred here. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=494.64s)]
*  I don't think there's any doubt about that. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=498.24s)]
*  There's a DEI angle. There's a ton of angles here. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=500.6s)]
*  But where were you when you saw this happen and what was your immediate thought? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=504.24s)]
*  Yeah, well, let me answer your first question first. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=508.64s)]
*  I think this was one of those events where you'll always remember where you were. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=510.8s)]
*  And I was just working in my office in Los Angeles. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=514.48s)]
*  I was going to fly to the Republican Convention in Milwaukee a few hours later. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=518.04s)]
*  And so someone texted me, the president's been shot. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=522.16s)]
*  Trump had been shot. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=524.0s)]
*  And my heart sank. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=525.0s)]
*  I immediately went online to see the video. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=526.0s)]
*  I think I saw in almost real time him go down. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=528.96s)]
*  And then when he stood back up and faced the crowd and told the Secret Service, wait, wait. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=533.2s)]
*  He didn't want to just let them kind of drag him away. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=538.88s)]
*  He turned to face the crowd and exposed his face. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=541.84s)]
*  Who knows if there had been another shooter? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=545.12s)]
*  Who knows if that shooter was really down? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=546.72s)]
*  But in that moment, he wanted to let the crowd know that he was fine. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  We were one inch away from the president of the United States having his head shot. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=552.24s)]
*  You know, he's got grandkids. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=556.4000000000001s)]
*  He's got a wife. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=558.08s)]
*  He's got kids. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=559.0400000000001s)]
*  He's got friends. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=560.4000000000001s)]
*  How do you feel about the individual? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=561.84s)]
*  His head was almost shot on television in front of thousands, hundreds, maybe thousands [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=563.36s)]
*  of people on live television. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=568.48s)]
*  And the gravity of this, I think, is very significant. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=570.24s)]
*  And I think we've in this media saturated environment, we've processed it too quick, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=572.72s)]
*  which is why on the docket I wanted to slow down here and just take in what happened. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=576.8000000000001s)]
*  One other very important detail for me is that my father-in-law was actually at that rally [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=581.1999999999999s)]
*  in Butler, at Butler Farm. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=586.56s)]
*  Really? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=589.04s)]
*  Yeah, he was there and he saw everything that happened. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=589.5999999999999s)]
*  And when we saw there was a shooting there, we were trying to get a hold of him and the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=592.0s)]
*  cell reception had been shut down and we couldn't get a hold of him for a couple hours. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=594.88s)]
*  And obviously we found out later that he was fine. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=597.5999999999999s)]
*  But what he described is that when the shots rang out, the president went down, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=600.7199999999999s)]
*  there was really a feeling of bedlam and pandemonium in the crowd. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=605.12s)]
*  The crowd was afraid that the president had been shot. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=609.6s)]
*  And so when he stood back up and faced the crowd and then said, fight, fight, fight, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=611.6800000000001s)]
*  it created this huge sense of relief. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=617.12s)]
*  It was palpable that he was fine. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=619.76s)]
*  And then the part that I don't think has been well reported is that the crowd started [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=623.6s)]
*  chanting USA, USA, USA. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=627.12s)]
*  So they responded with this unity. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=630.96s)]
*  It's been well reported that Trump said fight, fight, fight, but I don't think it's been well [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=632.96s)]
*  reported that the crowd started cheering USA, USA, USA. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=637.44s)]
*  So I think that the crowd turned from fear to unity and strength and patriotism, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=640.48s)]
*  reflecting what they saw from the president. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  Adam Lichman Yeah, that's well said. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=651.7600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=653.44s)]
*  Dr. Justin Marchegiani This is one of these things that's unbelievable. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  And the whole world, I think, has just seen how iconic it is. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=655.12s)]
*  I saw there's a video online even in, I think kids in Uganda were actually reenacting [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=658.48s)]
*  the assassination attempt. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=663.44s)]
*  Adam Lichman Yeah. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=664.6400000000001s)]
*  Dr. Justin Marchegiani That's how iconic it was. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  Trump's like a global legend for that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=666.8s)]
*  And again, there's just no way to fake what he did in that moment, right? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=668.4s)]
*  Where, again, he, I mean, the bullet missing him was either luck or, you know, hand of God [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=672.0799999999999s)]
*  or destiny, whatever you want to call it. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=679.52s)]
*  But him telling the Secret Service to stop, to face the crowd, to basically show that he [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=680.7199999999999s)]
*  was unharmed and that he was determined and he was defiant in the face of an assassin's bullet, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=686.4s)]
*  that's courage that nobody can fake. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=691.92s)]
*  And I've seen people online talk about how soldiers under fire, they've described how [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=693.68s)]
*  when they've been under fire, obviously, they hit the deck, they don't stand back up, you know, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=699.04s)]
*  even soldiers don't do that. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=703.1999999999999s)]
*  Adam Lichman His composure is incredible. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=705.04s)]
*  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Yeah, he just rose to the occasion [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=706.56s)]
*  in such an incredible way that I think it's inspired the whole country and the whole world. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=708.8s)]
*  There's just no way, again, to fake something like that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=713.92s)]
*  Even though some people like Reid Hoffman's political hack was actually claiming that it [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=717.12s)]
*  was all staged, which is just unbelievably ridiculous. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=722.16s)]
*  But I think the rest of the world knows that he just showed unbelievable courage in that [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=724.88s)]
*  moment and rose to the occasion and I think made the entire country proud. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=730.24s)]
*  Adam Lichman It certainly was an amount of bravery and a bold response. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=733.6s)]
*  I do think this, the next phase of this is sort of figuring out what happened with the Secret [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=739.36s)]
*  Service, as brave as it was for him to stand up. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=745.04s)]
*  That was a crazy thing to do. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=748.0s)]
*  I can't believe the Secret Service allowed him to get back up because there could have [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=749.2s)]
*  been a second shooter and although we heard radio chatter that the shooter was down, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=752.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean, how did you know in a situation like this what's actually happening? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=757.2s)]
*  They could have gotten a second shot off on the president. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=761.2800000000001s)]
*  Maybe they don't miss by an inch that time and then they hit it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=763.12s)]
*  So we got a lot of questions that need to be answered here. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=766.24s)]
*  Thank God he's okay. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=770.8000000000001s)]
*  And I think I guess now it's time to talk about rhetoric. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=772.4000000000001s)]
*  And I think that's actually from my perspective. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=775.36s)]
*  The next thing that has to happen here in terms of leadership, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=779.84s)]
*  when something this tragic happens, everybody's looking at the other side's rhetoric here, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=782.4000000000001s)]
*  whether it's putting Trump on a magazine cover as Hitler, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=787.9200000000001s)]
*  or they're saying you got to fight like hell or the oath keepers and all this January 6 [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=791.76s)]
*  nonsense and beating up cops. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=796.4000000000001s)]
*  I think we have to put both of these things aside and the leadership, Trump and Biden, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=798.24s)]
*  should be saying right now that, and leadership does start at the top, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=803.2s)]
*  this rhetoric is not to be done anymore. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=807.6s)]
*  People have to tone things down. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=811.12s)]
*  You could be passionate about politics, but using violent language, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=812.8000000000001s)]
*  there are sick people in the world and this kid, I think it will ultimately turn out like [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=816.08s)]
*  all the other assassins we've seen or these celebrity killings that occur, John Lennon, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=819.84s)]
*  et cetera. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=825.0400000000001s)]
*  It's usually a mentally ill person. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=825.36s)]
*  Likely what happened here, we don't know yet. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=827.44s)]
*  They interpret violent language differently than a normal person. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=830.48s)]
*  So we could say fight like hell or target or you got to fight for your country, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=834.64s)]
*  whatever it is, and we take it a certain way. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=839.84s)]
*  The sick people take it a different way and they need to put out a joint statement and just say, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=841.92s)]
*  anybody on our teams who uses violent rhetoric is no longer on our teams and they haven't done that. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=845.6s)]
*  So I think there's more work to be done here in terms of leadership. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=851.28s)]
*  I think it's more precise than that. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=854.64s)]
*  I think it's way more precise than this. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=856.48s)]
*  I don't think that this is years of Donald Trump using violent rhetoric. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=858.08s)]
*  I think this is years of mis- no, I don't, you cannot both sides. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=863.04s)]
*  I think this is years. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=866.88s)]
*  Of course, I just gave you examples of it. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=868.4s)]
*  I think what it is is that we have gone through years and years of literally the words that the [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  former president has said being perverted and misconstrued and chopped up into soundbites [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=876.48s)]
*  that advance a mainstream media's agenda to try to vilify a person. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=882.88s)]
*  And I think that that's an important thing to take a step back. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=889.76s)]
*  I think we have to understand that the mainstream media has really gone out of their way [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=893.6s)]
*  to amplify violent rhetoric and to actually associate violent rhetoric with as a [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=901.04s)]
*  tolerable reaction. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=908.56s)]
*  And I think that that is the thing that we need to now completely get rid of in our society. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=910.56s)]
*  I saw so many reactions to the former and probably future president of the United States [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=917.52s)]
*  getting shot, which was along the lines of basically hoping that that person hadn't missed [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=924.72s)]
*  and or justifying that violence on Donald Trump was somehow justified. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=932.5600000000001s)]
*  That's insane. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=937.12s)]
*  Now, that person could only have gotten that idea because the media fed them that language [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=938.48s)]
*  and that idea. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=943.76s)]
*  And I think that that's extremely scary because I don't think you actually see [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=944.72s)]
*  Republicans necessarily saying that about Joe Biden. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=950.0s)]
*  They may think that Joe Biden is feeble and mentally incompetent, but nobody's calling [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=953.92s)]
*  for the death of Joe Biden. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=960.48s)]
*  So I think that that's a very scary place where you have one group of people who are being fed [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=963.52s)]
*  this extremely toxic narrative. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=969.52s)]
*  And I think that that part of what you're saying, Jason, I agree with, but I really [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=970.8s)]
*  disagree with the other part, which is, and this is someone, again, as someone who was a former [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=975.1999999999999s)]
*  Democrat, I can observe this and be relatively rational here. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=980.0s)]
*  I didn't see that from the other side. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=983.3599999999999s)]
*  OK, well, the media is reflecting what is said by both candidates and both sides, and they both [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=985.28s)]
*  use very targeted language. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=990.9599999999999s)]
*  I'll put a couple of links in the show notes of both sides doing this, and you can make [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=992.7199999999999s)]
*  your own decision as the audience. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=996.56s)]
*  But I do think leadership would be both of them saying, stop this violent language, and [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=998.16s)]
*  both sides do it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1003.92s)]
*  I'd like to address that. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1004.96s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1006.32s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1006.96s)]
*  Just days before the shooting, Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman had an exchange at Allen and [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1007.52s)]
*  Company that was publicly reported in which Peter said that Reid had turned Trump into a [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1013.92s)]
*  martyr by funding lawfare. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1018.96s)]
*  And Reid responded, I wish I had turned him into an actual martyr. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1022.16s)]
*  OK, that's pretty clear. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1024.8s)]
*  OK, that's wishing for someone's death. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1026.8s)]
*  When the news of the assassination attempt came online, I don't think it was Jack Black [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1029.6799999999998s)]
*  himself, but a member of his band said that it's too bad the shot missed. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1034.8s)]
*  There are other people on the Democratic side who expressed similar sentiments. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1039.04s)]
*  They were disappointed that the assassination attempt had failed. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1042.8799999999999s)]
*  Now, I don't think those people are mainstream political leaders. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1047.28s)]
*  So yeah, that's just the distinction I wanted to make here. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1050.8s)]
*  Like there's no political leader who said that. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1054.0s)]
*  I'm not going to try and hang that around Joe Biden. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1056.08s)]
*  However, Biden himself days before the shooting said that it was time to put Trump in the [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1058.1599999999999s)]
*  bullseye. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1062.8s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1063.4399999999998s)]
*  And his defense for that rhetoric was why I didn't say cross hairs. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1064.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think bullseye means the same thing. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1067.36s)]
*  Now, even that, I'm willing to basically forgive because I don't think Biden meant it in a [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1069.52s)]
*  literal sense. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1076.32s)]
*  I think he was speaking rhetorically about, say, campaign ads, things like that. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1077.12s)]
*  I wouldn't necessarily say that was violent rhetoric. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1081.6s)]
*  OK, I'm not going to try and pin that on. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1083.84s)]
*  President Biden. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1086.8s)]
*  But the thing I do think was unacceptable by President Biden and the Democrats is the [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1087.6s)]
*  level of demonization and the level of vitriol that they have pursued against President Trump. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1093.1999999999998s)]
*  Not as a one-off statement, but as a campaign strategy. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1099.52s)]
*  Again, they have said over and over again, this man is Hitler. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1103.1999999999998s)]
*  This man is a fascist. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1106.1599999999999s)]
*  This man is a threat to democracy. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1107.4399999999998s)]
*  If he wins, it is the end of democracy. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1109.36s)]
*  They have repeatedly gone there and repeatedly used. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1112.08s)]
*  They've tried to Hitlerize him. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1114.96s)]
*  Now, if you're saying that this man is Hitler, where else is there to go rhetorically? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1117.3600000000001s)]
*  That's the worst thing you could ever say about somebody. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1123.2s)]
*  And quite frankly, if he is Hitler, why would you be offering him thoughts and prayers [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1126.48s)]
*  after he gets shot? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1132.0s)]
*  I mean, wouldn't it be a good thing to shoot Hitler? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1133.92s)]
*  And so I do think that, you know, if we think about the contribution of political rhetoric [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1136.88s)]
*  to what could have happened here, I'm not going to try and blame anybody for these [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1141.04s)]
*  one-off poor choices of language that could be interpreted as violent. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1144.4s)]
*  What I will blame them for is taking the demonization up to 11, taking the vitriol up to 11, because [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1148.64s)]
*  that could poison the mind of someone who's already mentally disturbed and say, okay, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1155.52s)]
*  well, wait a second, if he is Hitler, why wouldn't I be Colonel Van Stauffenberg [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1160.96s)]
*  for assassinating him? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1165.6000000000001s)]
*  Wouldn't I be a hero for trying to eliminate this man? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1166.5600000000002s)]
*  And that's the thing that I think is really unacceptable. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1170.96s)]
*  And I do think the Democrats should be blamed for that because, again, they made it a campaign [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1173.12s)]
*  strategy. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1177.4399999999998s)]
*  Their entire argument against Donald Trump is not about issues. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1178.1599999999999s)]
*  It's about this man being Hitler. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1182.2399999999998s)]
*  And I think it's ridiculous. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1183.6799999999998s)]
*  It's inflated. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1185.52s)]
*  It's hyperbole, to be sure. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1186.1599999999999s)]
*  And I think that we don't know yet about the mind of this shooter, this crooks. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1189.28s)]
*  But if anything contributed to the shooting, it was that. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1193.84s)]
*  J.D. Vance referred to him as Hitler as well. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1197.68s)]
*  Other people inside the Republican Party have referred to him as Hitler and a threat to [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1200.32s)]
*  democracy. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1203.2s)]
*  So there's plenty of blame to go around to, correct, Sax? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1203.84s)]
*  That happened over eight years ago as part of a text message exchange. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1206.6399999999999s)]
*  It wasn't a public rhetoric as a campaign strategy. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1210.72s)]
*  I'm talking about a systematic strategy that gets amplified. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1214.24s)]
*  Look at the cover of The New Republic. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1218.16s)]
*  They literally turned Donald Trump's face into the face of mashup of him and Adolf Hitler. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1219.92s)]
*  And it's been amplified and repeated over and over and over again on MSNBC, on CNN, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1226.4s)]
*  on all these liberal channels. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1232.96s)]
*  OK, this is coordinated political rhetoric as a campaign strategy. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1234.48s)]
*  It's not a one off. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1238.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm not going to blame anybody for a one off that could be misinterpreted. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1239.68s)]
*  But when you do this as a systematic campaign strategy and in fact, you base your entire [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1243.1200000000001s)]
*  campaign around the idea this man is a threat to democracy and a fascist, this is the language [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1249.0400000000002s)]
*  they used. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1253.44s)]
*  Like I said, there's nowhere else to go after that. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1254.0s)]
*  Where else do you go? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1256.72s)]
*  A threat to democracy, I think, is a valid criticism of Trump calling him Hitler. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1257.52s)]
*  Yeah, probably insightful. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1264.16s)]
*  So I think reasonable people can parse this. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1265.52s)]
*  And it is something that has occurred on both sides. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1269.04s)]
*  It's well documented and both parties can do better. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1272.24s)]
*  I think one thing that when the investigation happens into what happened here and we really [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1275.36s)]
*  figure out what happened in the Secret Service, how many examples do we need of institutions [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1282.56s)]
*  where we put in our trust just like letting us down? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1288.56s)]
*  And they just seem to be piling up and it's independent of administration. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1292.4s)]
*  And at some point, I think we have to like really check ourselves and say, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1296.88s)]
*  what has happened here? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1300.88s)]
*  Like, how do we objectively measure the quality of the people that are supposed to be working [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1302.32s)]
*  in these organizations and how do we make sure that they are actually competent to do their job? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1305.84s)]
*  This is the key point, Trimof, is the outcome. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1310.48s)]
*  How do we judge people? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1314.4s)]
*  Outcomes. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1315.76s)]
*  And if you look at the outcome, how the Secret Service director hasn't resigned now. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1316.32s)]
*  I mean, I know she's had a storied career and she's probably a good person who's done [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1320.96s)]
*  plenty of great things in her career. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1325.1200000000001s)]
*  I don't know the details of it. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1326.32s)]
*  But if the outcome of what you've done results in something this tragic and that could have [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1328.0s)]
*  been avoided, the proper thing is ownership and resignation. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1332.64s)]
*  Or the people who run this organization or the answer to being fired. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1337.44s)]
*  And so this absolute acceptance of mediocrity is something that has to change. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1341.0400000000002s)]
*  Is it an acceptance of mediocrity or is it that they just got completely distracted on [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1345.68s)]
*  things that are not germane to doing your job? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1352.16s)]
*  So, you know, if it was we need a diverse Secret Service or we need to have inclusion, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1355.5200000000002s)]
*  all of those things have nothing to do in my mind about protecting somebody. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1364.4s)]
*  There are characteristics and I suspect that there are women that embody these [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1367.68s)]
*  characteristics as much as men that embody these characteristics. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1370.72s)]
*  But why isn't there a psychographic way of determining who the best people are that have [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1373.68s)]
*  the protective instinct to protect the most important people that run our country? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1378.3200000000002s)]
*  There's a very simple test here. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1382.24s)]
*  The job of the Secret Service is to jump in front of a bullet, as we witnessed. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1383.92s)]
*  In order to jump in front of a bullet, you have to be bigger than the target, right? [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1387.68s)]
*  You have to be. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1390.96s)]
*  So a six foot two woman who's four feet wide, just as qualified as a man who's six [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1391.92s)]
*  foot two, four feet wide for that job description, you have to be brave enough [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1395.68s)]
*  to jump in front of a bullet. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1398.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if you guys saw, but there was like a thing where and I feel bad for this woman [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1400.16s)]
*  who's being derided as being totally incompetent, the one in the field. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1404.48s)]
*  But there was a David Attenborough voiceover. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1407.92s)]
*  Of her trying to put her gun back in the house. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1410.5600000000002s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, my gosh, I mean, apparently I think Eric Trump said she's [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1412.4s)]
*  seen the D.E.I. another day. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1416.16s)]
*  Memes. Yeah. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1418.8s)]
*  Yeah. This is just I mean, it's a very unfortunate video. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1419.44s)]
*  Say that she's like the best person ever. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1423.1200000000001s)]
*  I think he was trying to support her. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1425.1200000000001s)]
*  She may have just had a bad moment. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1426.72s)]
*  Who knows? I mean, it did look pretty bad that she was having trouble holstering her weapon. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1428.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, not that I'm a gun expert. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1431.92s)]
*  A lot of adrenaline running at that moment. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1433.92s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, look, it's what's known as an outside the waistband holster, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1435.84s)]
*  which is the easiest type of holster to use because you don't have to tuck it [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1439.04s)]
*  into your pants or anything like that. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1442.48s)]
*  And I got to say it does look pretty bad that she was having so much trouble just [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1444.3999999999999s)]
*  trying to holster her weapon. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1451.1999999999998s)]
*  But look, I think this is only one of a number of questions that I think have been legitimately [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1452.1599999999999s)]
*  raised about the Secret Service performance. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1458.32s)]
*  And we need a full investigation to figure out what happened. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1461.04s)]
*  And let me just, you know, let me just run off a list of questions that I would like to see answered. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1465.6s)]
*  So number one is how do they fail to cover that roof? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1470.0s)]
*  It was the most obvious shooting spot in that entire Butler farm area, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1472.96s)]
*  and it was not properly covered. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1477.28s)]
*  And then the Secret Service releases this statement that they didn't cover it because [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1478.88s)]
*  it was a sloped roof, which is the most ridiculous cover story ever, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1482.88s)]
*  because they did have snipers on another roof that was more sloped. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1487.28s)]
*  And that's like five times more slope. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1490.56s)]
*  Right. Right. So that sounds like a lie. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1492.56s)]
*  Right. So once you put out that that cover story, which is basically a lie, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1494.24s)]
*  you only make the situation worse. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1499.6s)]
*  And it only makes the question even more poignant of how do you fail to cover that roof? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1501.44s)]
*  Okay. Did you see the picture of the Secret Service on top of the White House roof, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1505.6s)]
*  which is extremely even more sloped than the I mean, it's just ridiculous. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1509.12s)]
*  And the Secret Service director, Cheadle said that on ABC. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1513.84s)]
*  Okay. So right there, she should be fired because she's lying to us at a moment where [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1516.96s)]
*  she should be cooperating and doing a full investigation. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1521.28s)]
*  Okay. So isn't it true that they were inside the [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1523.84s)]
*  the structure? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1526.8799999999999s)]
*  It was air conditioned inside the building and outside it was probably hot. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1528.32s)]
*  Okay. But that's just question number one. Okay. Question number two is like you said, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1531.2s)]
*  he was a person of interest an hour before the shooting and no one went to go resolve [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1535.76s)]
*  that situation. Moreover, they see him with a rangefinder. Okay. What the hell do you use [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1541.04s)]
*  a rangefinder for? I mean, he's scoping out the target with a rangefinder and they let the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1546.3999999999999s)]
*  president go out there. Okay. While they stole a person of interest out there, this guy has [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1552.08s)]
*  a rangefinder. He has a ladder. He has a backpack and he was never intercepted. He was never stopped [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1556.8s)]
*  even though they had identified him and they let the president go out there. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1561.76s)]
*  So clearly there was a huge failure of communication between the Secret Service [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1564.8799999999999s)]
*  and the Trump campaign. How did that happen? How was there no agent stationed at the fence [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1568.48s)]
*  such that they had to ram it with an SUV for the Secret Service to get through? I don't know if [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1573.04s)]
*  you guys knew about that part of it. Okay. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1577.52s)]
*  No, no. Say that again. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1578.96s)]
*  There was no agent stationed at the fence. Okay. So in order to get there, they rammed the fence [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1580.4s)]
*  with an SUV so the Secret Service quickly get through. Oh my gosh. Okay. That's insane. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1585.8400000000001s)]
*  And what harm would have come from just taking a half hour and have Trump have a cup of coffee [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1591.2s)]
*  and then go make sure that this person is not exactly like exactly. I'm just thinking judgment [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1597.8400000000001s)]
*  wise. Listen, I understand they're in the field. I understand. I understand if like they were [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1603.0400000000002s)]
*  concerned, maybe that's one of our snipers on the roof. Like maybe there was a moment, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1606.88s)]
*  like a 30 second moment. Like I'm trying to give them the benefit of the doubt here, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1611.1200000000001s)]
*  but it's hard to. The Secret Service sniper who did an incredible job taking out the shooter in [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1614.96s)]
*  one shot. Okay. He had that person lined up. So again, why haven't they released the audio? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1620.72s)]
*  There must be an audio recording of all the chatter on their earpieces, their communication. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1628.0s)]
*  A hundred percent. That sniper must have identified [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1632.0s)]
*  crooks as a potential target and had him lined up, which is how he's able to take him out [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1635.12s)]
*  very quickly. But what was the chain of command there in terms of him seeking authorization? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1639.76s)]
*  Hey, who is this person? Why wasn't everything stop while they go to figure out what this person is [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1645.52s)]
*  doing on the roof there? Okay. And then once the shots rang out and Trump gets shot, why did it [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1649.84s)]
*  take him so long to get him in the car, to get the convoy off to a hospital? There was a long delay [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1657.4399999999998s)]
*  in terms of getting him out of there. So they clearly weren't prepared for that. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1661.76s)]
*  The whole thing, it just reeks of, of incompetence. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1666.48s)]
*  Yeah. And they don't have a great track record of being honest about what's going on. They don't [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1670.56s)]
*  remember not to bring up January 6th again, but they deleted all their texts from January 6th. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1674.48s)]
*  Like they do not, they circle the wagons. They do not want people criticizing. I doubt we're [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1679.28s)]
*  even going to get that audio. I wonder if that audio is going to come out. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1684.16s)]
*  But they don't have the right in a democracy to basically investigate themselves and say, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1687.92s)]
*  oh, we're good. No, that's not how it works. The people of this country need accountability. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1692.0800000000002s)]
*  The once and likely future president came within millimeters, centimeters of being assassinated. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1698.64s)]
*  And this whole country could have been plunged into a whole different type of situation. We need [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1705.28s)]
*  answers to these questions. And this director, Cheadle is obviously in the way and putting out [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1709.92s)]
*  nonsense, putting out spin at a time when we need a proper investigation that needs to happen [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1715.84s)]
*  immediately. Cheadle should resign. We need to have agents. Secret service agents need to be [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1721.76s)]
*  offered up to testify on Capitol Hill with no fear of reprisal from the Biden administration. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1727.36s)]
*  Including the sniper. The first person that needs to speak in a congressional hearing is the sniper [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1733.6799999999998s)]
*  himself. Did you guys see there was coverage yesterday that showed there's actually two snipers [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1742.56s)]
*  and two? Yeah. Well, no, sorry. There's two sets of snipers. There's four snipers. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1746.6399999999999s)]
*  The one set of snipers that you see the video of where he does that. There's a tree blocking [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1751.52s)]
*  their ability to see crooks. The other set of snipers are the ones that apparently took the [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1755.9199999999998s)]
*  fatal shot and they had a line of sight, but they're not on camera. So you don't actually [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1762.0s)]
*  see what's going on with them. That's the current reporting I've seen on it. So I don't want to [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1766.24s)]
*  jump to conclusions given that there's now seeming to be. There's no excuse here because [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1771.6000000000001s)]
*  let me just say. If they saw the guy on the roof and they let the president on the stage, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1775.92s)]
*  someone asked up. That doesn't seem appropriate. Why not have a delay? Not the end of the world. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1780.56s)]
*  If we can put that bird's eye view of Butler Farm on the screen. I don't know, Nick, if you have that. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1785.1200000000001s)]
*  Nick, pull it up where it shows the line of sight with the tree as well so you can see it all. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1790.48s)]
*  Yeah, there it is. But look at the shooter's position and look at Trump's position. Okay. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1794.0s)]
*  And I've seen broader bird's eye views of Butler Farm without knowing anything about marksmanship. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1798.56s)]
*  It's just obvious that that roof is the most if you could set yourself up anywhere as a sniper. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1805.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's the president is the most obvious location. Furthermore, let me just say that [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1811.04s)]
*  which Moth and I hosted that dinner for President Trump. We worked with the Secret Service, you know, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1816.0s)]
*  advanced team and they were excellent. They were really great. And I saw just a little bit of their [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1821.76s)]
*  process and they went through the house. They mapped out the entire house, the entire property. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1826.32s)]
*  Then they asked, well, where's the president gonna be sitting at dinner? They wanted to know [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1831.4399999999998s)]
*  who's to his right, who's to his left. They looked at the window coverage of that room and they said, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  okay, whose house is that? That neighbor's house. And they went to go check it out. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1839.6799999999998s)]
*  Every single movement by the president was mapped out. Every angle on the president was basically [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1843.6799999999998s)]
*  mapped out and explored. What happened here then? Like that's the crazy part. It was actually amazing [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1850.8s)]
*  to watch. I thought they did a great job. It was really amazing. This is why how could this ever [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1854.88s)]
*  have happened where the most obvious shooting angle on the president was not properly covered. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1859.2s)]
*  It just makes no sense. You can put two blues up there. Just two beat officers on there would have [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1864.88s)]
*  solved the whole problem. If you don't have enough Secret Service agents. I was at a Clinton benefit [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1869.44s)]
*  one time and I got detained the Secret Service and went into secondary screening. The reason given, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1875.1200000000001s)]
*  I had two cell phones on. They thought it was peculiar that I had two cell phones. They kept [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1880.88s)]
*  me for 15, 20 minutes in a side room and they literally took my phone apart in front of me. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1884.64s)]
*  Took all the batteries out, went through every bag. They frisked me. I mean, wandered me like [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1889.2800000000002s)]
*  three guys around me. They take this incredibly seriously. Yeah. Normally they're very thorough [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1894.4s)]
*  and they're very serious. I mean, look, even at the dinner that we hosted, they wanted to know [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1899.3600000000001s)]
*  what kind of steak knives we were using. Literally they wanted to make sure that [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1902.3200000000002s)]
*  that was safe. And this is why they were so interested in knowing who was to the president's [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1907.6000000000001s)]
*  right and to his left because they want to think through every possible angle of attack [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1912.48s)]
*  on the president. There was some breakdown here. And in this case, something very strange happened. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1917.44s)]
*  And of course, as I was just sort of alluding to early, if this person looked like a SWAT member, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1922.96s)]
*  which apparently he did, fatigue's, you know, range finder, all that stuff, I'm guessing that maybe [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1930.24s)]
*  those snipers from the Secret Service thought those were friendlies. That's the only possible [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1935.52s)]
*  explanation of why they paused. Yeah, but he wasn't dressed that way. He wasn't wearing a [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1940.24s)]
*  costume or he wasn't impersonating. I thought he had fatigues, but even still, a person laying there, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1945.92s)]
*  the great fear you have as a police officer is shooting another police officer. So I think that [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1953.76s)]
*  from whatever number of feet away, maybe that's what they thought. Yeah. Are you telling me in 2024 [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1960.56s)]
*  that when you show up at an event to protect a VVIP, like the President of the United States, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1966.96s)]
*  that SWAT and other people aren't given some kind of like little pin that has an NFC chip or [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1975.3600000000001s)]
*  something where everybody knows who everybody is so that it's very clear very quickly when somebody [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1983.68s)]
*  in a position of risk is not on the home team? They do have ways of doing that, right? There is [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1988.96s)]
*  when you're undercover- Are you telling me, for example, like President Trump's pin or [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=1997.04s)]
*  Barack Obama's pin or Joe Biden's pin doesn't actually have something in it? I'd be shocked [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2000.8s)]
*  if the answer is it's just a pin. Well, this is a report that they're investigating that the delay [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2007.6000000000001s)]
*  in shooting the sniper might have been that they thought it was friendly. So this theory is out [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2012.8s)]
*  there now and it's part of the investigation. It is a potential one. I can tell you that that would [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2018.16s)]
*  be the nightmare scenario for the Secret Service is to shoot the local cop. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2023.28s)]
*  Honestly, guys, I hate to be the one to say this, but we've just, our institutions are incompetent. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2027.52s)]
*  There's a lot of incompetence. Absolutely. It's just like Afghanistan withdrawal. Remember that? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2033.84s)]
*  No heads rolled. There was no proper investigation of why so many people died unnecessarily in that [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2037.6s)]
*  Afghanistan withdrawal. Nobody's fired for anything anymore. It's just ridiculous. And [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2042.56s)]
*  there's no resigning, obviously. Nobody resigns. Nobody gets fired. Why would anybody? So if this [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2047.04s)]
*  was a company, this would be a failing company. Why would you not strip it down from top to bottom [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2052.08s)]
*  and rebuild it? Well, exactly. And I tweeted this counterfactual, which is imagine if Elon had bought [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2058.64s)]
*  Twitter, but he wasn't allowed to fire anybody. Do you think he would have been able to restore [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2063.84s)]
*  free speech? Do you think he'd be able to restore innovation? No. If you're running an institution, [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2068.64s)]
*  you have to be able to fire people when they don't perform. But we have lost that ability [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2073.44s)]
*  of our federal government. So there's something that's very, very broken here. When people fail, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2079.44s)]
*  they have to be held accountable or you don't get good performance. Right. When institutions fail, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2085.44s)]
*  there needs to be a question on why are we funding those institutions? Nobody gets fired. Why would [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2090.48s)]
*  you give more money to a failing company? You would never do it. This is the comment I put in [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2095.04s)]
*  the letter that I sent to that senior Democrat back in October. I don't see any accountability [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2099.44s)]
*  with respect to the programs that you pass bills to fund. You pass bills to fund these programs, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2104.7999999999997s)]
*  you stand up new institutions, and then there is never a retrospective post-mortem or review [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2109.6s)]
*  on the performance of those institutions or the objective of those programs. And yet we keep [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2114.72s)]
*  funding them and asking for more money. And eventually you end up with a decaying empire. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2118.56s)]
*  Like we've seen in history, we need to have a series of actions that drive accountability [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2123.12s)]
*  in federal programs and then a review on the intention of those programs and make sure that [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2128.72s)]
*  they still hold. And then we can move forward with new programs. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2133.04s)]
*  Sachs is really right. Like you cannot have the Secret Service investigate themselves on this one. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2136.56s)]
*  Of course not. And they deleted all their text message and did a major cover up the last time [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2140.72s)]
*  around. So you cannot trust them to investigate themselves. No. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2144.48s)]
*  Did you see all those senators chasing them up the stairs yesterday? You see that? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2147.12s)]
*  I did see that. It didn't say which senators it was. I don't know if that was confirmed. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2150.64s)]
*  It was. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2154.72s)]
*  Or Blackburn. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2155.12s)]
*  What happened? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2156.08s)]
*  So a bunch of the senators confronted the head of the Secret Service. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2156.56s)]
*  Cheadle is her name, right? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2160.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2162.08s)]
*  And they confronted her and there's a someone videoed the whole thing on their iPhone [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2162.56s)]
*  of them saying, we need answers. Why did you let this happen? Here's a video. Nick can show it. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2166.7999999999997s)]
*  Here, just watch it. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2171.12s)]
*  My gosh. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2182.3999999999996s)]
*  That's a bad video because what it does not show is the start and the end at the start. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2183.4399999999996s)]
*  They were all standing around her having a conversation and then they started to press [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2187.44s)]
*  her and she said, now's not the time. This isn't the forum. Then she took off. They followed her. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2191.52s)]
*  And then she went into the Secret Service secure room upstairs and blocked all the senators from [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2196.56s)]
*  coming into the room. Her Secret Service staff blocked them. So all the guards said, no, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2201.28s)]
*  you can't come in. So they all got blocked out. So the senators were pushing her for some feedback, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2205.28s)]
*  for conversation, for dialogue, and she wouldn't engage. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2209.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2212.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh my gosh. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2212.96s)]
*  I've seen enough. Resign now. Get out of the way. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2213.84s)]
*  So a proper investigation can be done. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2217.44s)]
*  Total. Total. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2219.44s)]
*  Absolutely. Okay. Let's talk about the RNC. A friend of ours gave a talk and the VP was selected. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2220.7200000000003s)]
*  You did a great job, Bestie. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2228.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2230.88s)]
*  What was it like to get on that stage? I have a bunch of questions about it. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2231.52s)]
*  Yeah. What was it like? [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2237.36s)]
*  It seemed like people are not sitting in chairs, right? They're just mulling about, tell us. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2238.2400000000002s)]
*  Give us the behind the scenes. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2242.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2244.0s)]
*  What was it like getting prepped and doing all the prep work? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2244.8s)]
*  Do you have to review your speech? Tell us all the details. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2248.0s)]
*  I started working on this about a week before the convention. They sent me some ideas for remarks, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2251.28s)]
*  and then I completely rewrote it with my research assistant slash writer, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2257.76s)]
*  and then sent it to them. There was some back and forth, but by and large, they [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2262.0s)]
*  let me do what I wanted to do. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2265.52s)]
*  Did they give you a time? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2266.96s)]
*  The one thing that was set was the time, and they correlated the time with a number of words. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2269.44s)]
*  They said you've got six minutes, which is 600 words. That's what we worked towards. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2277.44s)]
*  Then the big thing I had to learn was just how to use the teleprompter. They had these [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2283.12s)]
*  rooms set up where there were teleprompters, and I could do some training on how to read a speech [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2287.92s)]
*  using a teleprompter. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2295.28s)]
*  What is that like? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2296.64s)]
*  It's just a matter of knowing where to look and trying to stay natural, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2299.2799999999997s)]
*  but also using the prompter as a mnemonic device. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2303.2s)]
*  Does the prompter stop when you stop, or how does that work? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2306.48s)]
*  There is actually somebody in the room who is physically advancing the words as you're speaking. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2310.16s)]
*  There's someone who's actually working the prompter, and they will go out. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2315.52s)]
*  So if you get big applause, they'll pause it for you, and you don't have to try to keep up. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2318.24s)]
*  Exactly. That was probably the biggest thing to learn. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2322.32s)]
*  The other thing about it is that you're speaking to a huge convention hall, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2326.7200000000003s)]
*  and so you feel like you really want to project in order to reach people, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2331.52s)]
*  but at the same time, you're really speaking on TV. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2335.92s)]
*  As you guys know, you'll come across as being kind of insane if you start yelling into a TV set. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2338.96s)]
*  So finding the right balance between speaking to people in the auditorium [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2345.6000000000004s)]
*  and speaking to people watching from home, that's kind of tricky, and I'm reasonably happy with it. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2349.2s)]
*  The most important thing is I got to say the substance of what I said. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2354.8799999999997s)]
*  Not universally popular, right? You basically called for an end to the conflict in Ukraine [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2358.0s)]
*  and to stop funding Ukraine's defense against Russia, and that's not a popular opinion in [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2364.72s)]
*  the Republican Party, is that right? Well, I went further than that. I said that [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2370.64s)]
*  this was not an unprovoked war. It was a provoked war. I said the Biden administration provoked the [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2374.16s)]
*  war with talk of NATO expansion. You can disagree with that if you want. I think there's plenty of [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2378.32s)]
*  evidence for it. That's what I believe. I feel like you went out on a limb more than most other [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2382.6400000000003s)]
*  speakers who kind of had a lot of good laudatory comments and promoted Trump. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2386.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you could have pandered. Yeah, you actually went out with a [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2392.7200000000003s)]
*  strongly held opinion that is fairly contrarian, right? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2395.44s)]
*  Well, I think that most of the people in the Republican Party, including most people on the [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2400.96s)]
*  floor, actually agreed with me. I think it took them a second to process what I had said. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2404.8s)]
*  What I saw when I was up there is I said that Biden provoked, yes, provoked the war. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2411.52s)]
*  I think it was such a shocking statement to a lot of people because we've heard the whole [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2417.6800000000003s)]
*  unprovoked invasion narrative so many times that there were murmurs and then people got it and they [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2421.28s)]
*  started applauding. I never actually intended it to even be an applause line. I just thought it was [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2426.1600000000003s)]
*  an important thing to state the truth as I see it on the record at the Republican convention. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2430.24s)]
*  That line did actually get applause. Now, a bunch of Ukraine stans were predictably outraged by what [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2435.8399999999997s)]
*  I said and they were trying to claim online that somehow I'd been booed or something like that. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2442.16s)]
*  There were absolutely no boos. There were actually people applauding. Then as I got deeper and [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2445.3599999999997s)]
*  deeper into the speech, people applauded it more and more. It was very much a speech that attacked [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2449.8399999999997s)]
*  the forever wars. It attacked the warmongers and complimented President Trump for keeping us out of [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2454.08s)]
*  wars and complimented him for being strong, but also having the savviness and the ability to [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2459.68s)]
*  negotiate with our adversaries to keep us out of wars. I think that's now a position that's very [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2466.8799999999997s)]
*  popular within the Republican party, but it's a process. It's evolving. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2471.3599999999997s)]
*  Aaron Powell This is a perfect segue because there are reports that friend of the pod, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2476.0s)]
*  Tucker Colson, had a big impact on talking to Trump about his selection of JD Vance and said, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2479.8399999999997s)]
*  don't pick a neocon. That'll get you assassinated. There was one report. That was advice that came [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2485.52s)]
*  before the assassination attempt, obviously, so conspiracy theorists are kind of losing their [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2491.36s)]
*  minds over this. Let's talk about the selection of JD Vance because that is a big surprise, [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2495.44s)]
*  I think, in many quarters. Tell us about JD Vance. You're friends, yeah? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2501.92s)]
*  Pete Slauson I'm friends with him and I very much [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2507.04s)]
*  supported his selection for VP. Aaron Powell [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2510.24s)]
*  Well, I see the best pick in your mind. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2512.64s)]
*  Pete Slauson Well, there's a couple of things. JD Vance [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2514.56s)]
*  represents a couple of very interesting characteristics. On the one hand, he's from [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2516.96s)]
*  this poor region of Appalachia that really represents the forgotten man or the forgotten [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2522.32s)]
*  cities and towns in America. You could call it the MAGA heartland. So, MAGA really likes him. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2528.96s)]
*  At the same time, he's worked in tech. He was a venture capitalist. He understands the future [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2535.2000000000003s)]
*  and he's popular in tech. So, it's very unusual to get somebody who has MAGA plus tech on their [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2540.0s)]
*  side together. So, that's one almost contradiction you could say that JD represents. Here's another [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2546.4s)]
*  one. JD Vance was in high school when the Twin Towers came down and then we invaded Iraq and he [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2552.2400000000002s)]
*  was gung-ho to serve and to go exact retribution and justice on America's enemies and he enlisted [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2559.84s)]
*  in the Marine Corps and he went off to serve in the Iraq War. Subsequently, he realized that we [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2567.52s)]
*  had all been lied to about the Iraq War and that it was a gigantic mistake and moreover, the forever [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2573.44s)]
*  wars were a huge mistake. And to me, this is something that I really appreciate about him [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2578.24s)]
*  and this is a quality that I really want at President Trump's side, which is he's an American [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2583.92s)]
*  patriot. He had the courage to serve, to go serve in America's wars, but he has the wisdom and the [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2589.2s)]
*  judgment to want to avoid those wars when we don't need to fight them. And there's way too [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2594.88s)]
*  many of, like you said, Jason, these neocons, these warmongers in the party who've never ever [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2599.92s)]
*  acknowledged their mistake in the Iraq War and all the forever wars and they seem on virtually [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2604.88s)]
*  a daily basis to want to plunge us into the next forever war. So, this is, I think, a quality that's [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2610.56s)]
*  of paramount importance to have in our Commander-in-Chief and in the person who would be next in line to [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2616.7200000000003s)]
*  be Commander-in-Chief. So, for these reasons, I very much support JD. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2622.32s)]
*  All right. So, let me get some feedback from the rest of the panel and just give you a couple of [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2626.8s)]
*  bullet points about him for those of you who don't know JD Vance. Yeah, he worked at Peter [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2630.48s)]
*  Teel's Mythril Capital and Steve Case's Revolution. And so, he worked for Republican and a Democrat, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2634.96s)]
*  and Steve Case started his own farm called Narya Capital. And he went to Ohio State, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2640.7200000000003s)]
*  graduated Yale, was actually classmates with Vivek. They talked about that. He's only 39 [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2647.92s)]
*  years old. So, he's half the age of Trump. As you mentioned, combat correspondent for six months [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2652.64s)]
*  in Iraq in 2005, 39 years old. And Teel backed him with, I think, the largest Senate race donation [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2656.2400000000002s)]
*  in history, 15 million. And so, this is quite a ascension, Chamath, from a venture capitalist [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2663.44s)]
*  to potentially vice president and obviously potentially president. He's in the second spot. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2671.04s)]
*  So, were you a proponent of the JD Vance as well? The press says you lobby Trump as well. Is that [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2677.52s)]
*  true? He's superb. I cannot say enough good things about this guy. He's superb. Why is he superb? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2684.8s)]
*  He is a, he's a bit of an enigma, I think, as Sac said, because his views are [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2692.96s)]
*  so unique. And he comes from a background that is very similar to mine. So, I have tremendous loyalty [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2700.72s)]
*  for the path that he had to navigate to get out, just to get out. And I think that that, you know, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2708.88s)]
*  I really care for people like that. And then he's done really good things with the resources that [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2716.8s)]
*  he's been given and the relationships that he's built. And I really respect that too. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2723.6s)]
*  We all read Hillbilly, Elegy. I don't know if we talked about it on this pod years ago, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2730.1600000000003s)]
*  but you and I certainly talked about it a bunch, Chamath. And, you know, he came from nothing. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2734.32s)]
*  Less than nothing. Less than nothing. Addicts in his family. And he talks a lot in his book. I [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2741.6800000000003s)]
*  don't know if you remember this, about social capital and the fact that he didn't understand, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2746.8s)]
*  by the name of the firm, his social capital, people don't know the reference, that he just [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2751.36s)]
*  didn't have the social capital to even understand that a lawyer went to law school. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2754.48s)]
*  And, you know, he is an enigma. His positions don't align with Trump's in every case, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2758.8s)]
*  but they have quickly become aligned with Trump's. He's an incredible pick now. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2764.96s)]
*  I thought he was an incredible pick before his speech last night. And he even exceeded my [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2770.0s)]
*  expectations in that speech. I just thought it was truly an incredible speech. First of all, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2774.56s)]
*  the introduction by his wife, Usha, was really, you know, incredible. I thought she did a fantastic [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2779.84s)]
*  job. And then he got up there and a friend texted me, he's not really that into politics. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2784.72s)]
*  He's just like, this guy seems so normal. He's happy. He's normal. He seems competent. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2790.08s)]
*  There was one commentator, I think, on one of the cable shows, who I think meant this as an insult, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2794.56s)]
*  but it actually was positive. He said that when you're at like a fast food restaurant or something, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2800.16s)]
*  and need to ask for the manager, JD Vance is the person you hope is the manager. You know, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2805.12s)]
*  he comes out, he's friendly. He's competent. He's reasonable. He knows how to get stuff done. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2810.24s)]
*  I'm not sure if that was meant as an insult or a compliment. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2816.08s)]
*  It's meant as an insult. Yeah, I can tell you that's meant as an insult. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2817.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but I think it's a compliment, right? And he's just so normal. He's gonna be very [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2820.3999999999996s)]
*  hard to demonize. Obviously, they're trying to do it on cable news. They're somehow trying to [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2824.3199999999997s)]
*  portray him as an extremist or a racist, even though he has a mixed race family. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2828.4799999999996s)]
*  The tent of the Republican Party at this RNC, Saks, is the most wide open tent I've ever seen [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2833.68s)]
*  in politics. They had Amber Rose and people were criticizing Amber Rose. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2839.92s)]
*  She was excellent. She was excellent. She was fantastic. I thought she was excellent. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2843.04s)]
*  And she knocked the ball out of the park and she's a pro-choice. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2846.32s)]
*  She looked absolutely radiant. She was beautiful and she crushed it. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2848.7200000000003s)]
*  I thought her speech was effective. I thought it was authentic and it described her redpilling, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2852.64s)]
*  basically. It described her evolution and her journey from someone who believed the media's [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2857.28s)]
*  lies about Trump thinking that he was a racist to actually meeting the man herself, realizing that [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2862.0s)]
*  the way they had portrayed him was basically a slander and how she became friends with President [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2868.7999999999997s)]
*  Trump. I thought it was an incredibly effective speech. But look, there was very few people who [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2874.48s)]
*  didn't like it. There was this one post by Matt Walsh online and he was roundly denounced for what [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2878.64s)]
*  he said. I mean, he kind of engaged in this pearl clutching that they had allowed Amber Rose to [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2884.8799999999997s)]
*  speak because of her background. Yeah, and my value judging. And it's like, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2889.2799999999997s)]
*  who's Matt Walsh to judge? It felt like a part of the [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2892.48s)]
*  Republican party that's on its way out, this pearl clutching social conservatism. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2896.24s)]
*  In any event, it was really an opportunity, I think, for people to disavow his criticism [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2901.04s)]
*  and support her. Yeah, and that was my point here is what they've done a really great job of. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2906.3199999999997s)]
*  And Vape did a wonderful job in his talk. I want to give him a shout out of just saying, [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2912.0s)]
*  hey, listen, everybody can be part of this party. I think there's a lot of notes the Democrats could [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2916.4799999999996s)]
*  take from what they saw at the Republican National Convention. These are people who would have been [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2920.3999999999996s)]
*  at the DNC, but you know, one election cycle ago, but because of this purity test, you can't even [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2924.96s)]
*  win with them. Let's take the obvious. We're trending into a direction right now where based [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2931.2s)]
*  on Donald Trump's pick for the vice president and some of the other surrogates like Vivek, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2936.56s)]
*  if Donald Trump were to win, what you're going to see is a very youthful cabinet of a lot of [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2943.28s)]
*  30-somethings and 40-somethings. And I think that that's a really important thing to consider [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2951.68s)]
*  versus a bunch of 60, 70 and 80-year-old career politicians. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2957.2s)]
*  Correct. Absolutely. Youth and vigor. And again, this new direction. You know, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2961.52s)]
*  a lot of people were commenting about JD's speech that large parts of it could have been given by [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2965.44s)]
*  Bernie Sanders or, you know, it's this populist message that- [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2970.24s)]
*  Well, let me ask you that, yes, Sax. He's had a position of breaking up big tech and being pro [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2975.04s)]
*  union. How do you reconcile all that and this new Republican party? Address those two, because that [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2982.96s)]
*  seems to be a big discussion topic. Yeah. I think that it's definitely a [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2989.36s)]
*  new emergent Republican party where this is, I think this is Donald Trump's Republican party. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=2995.2s)]
*  This is the MAGA wing, the America First wing of the Republican party. We're moving from a party [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3000.64s)]
*  of basically the Chamber of Commerce, you know, business roundtable, a bunch of oligarchic fat [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3006.48s)]
*  cats to being a populist party that actually represents the people. And I think it's a very- [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3012.3199999999997s)]
*  And unions. And they had the teamsters up there. Yeah. And I think it's a very welcome change. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3018.0s)]
*  And the part of JD's speech that I like the best is when he described that, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3022.72s)]
*  hey, I went off and many other people went off to fight in these forever wars, risking our lives or [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3026.72s)]
*  giving our lives. We come back to our home communities and what do we find? We find them [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3032.0s)]
*  hollowed out. The jobs have all been exported. The factories have shut down. And instead, the town has [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3036.48s)]
*  been poisoned by fentanyl. That is a message that you have not heard in the Republican party, [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3041.4399999999996s)]
*  except for Donald Trump and that new part of the party. And I think that Donald Trump choosing JD [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3046.7999999999997s)]
*  Vance was so important to cement this new vision of the Republican party. It was a legacy pick [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3051.76s)]
*  because it means that this America First MAGA message is going to continue into the future, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3057.6000000000004s)]
*  many years into the future. And let me just tell you, as I listened to that speech, I hearken back [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3063.28s)]
*  to another speech at a public convention I heard 32 years ago. I'm sorry to say I'm old enough to [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3070.0s)]
*  actually remember these things. And I remember Pat Buchanan's speech in 1992. And after Pat [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3075.52s)]
*  described the factory workers who lost their jobs, I just wanted to read you what he said, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3083.04s)]
*  and I want you to think about what JD said. So what Buchanan said was, my friends, these people [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3087.36s)]
*  are our people. They don't read Adam Smith or Edmund Burke, but they come from the same schoolyards [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3093.68s)]
*  and the same playgrounds and towns as we come from. They share our beliefs and convictions, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3099.12s)]
*  our hopes and dreams. They are the conservatives of the heart. They are our people, and we need to [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3103.84s)]
*  reconnect with them. We need to let them know we know how bad they're hurting. They don't expect [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3108.2400000000002s)]
*  miracles of us, but they need to know we care. And I think that for too long, Republican leaders [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3112.88s)]
*  ignored that advice. They didn't connect with everyday Americans. They were foolishly willing [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3118.4s)]
*  to cut programs like Social Security or Medicare, saying that we had to cut the deficit while at [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3124.08s)]
*  the same time funding forever wars. So they're totally not credible. And the party was basically [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3129.6s)]
*  led by warmongers like Dick Cheney or Mitch McConnell or sole as bean counters like Mitt [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3136.3199999999997s)]
*  Romney and Paul Ryan. And I think Vance really broke with all of that. And I think he represents [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3142.08s)]
*  the future of the party. He trashed the Iraq war. He promised no more foreign interventions. He railed [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3150.4s)]
*  against policies that benefit multinational corporations, the expensive workers. And I think [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3155.92s)]
*  it's no wonder that the neocons lobbied so hard against his selection. But I think those days are [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3161.84s)]
*  over. And I think that, just to say at this end with this, that I think that Donald Trump and [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3169.92s)]
*  JD Vance represent a conservatism of the heart that we haven't seen before. And I think this is [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3175.04s)]
*  the future of the Republican Party. Freiburg does JD Vance being selected [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3181.6s)]
*  tip your vote towards Trump Vance? I think he's gonna do well for Trump. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3185.68s)]
*  I think if he, what were his other options? Nikki Alley. I mean, there were pressure for him to go [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3193.6s)]
*  after a lot of the neocons, right? Saxon get the never Trumper contingent. Wasn't that like a lot [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3201.2s)]
*  of the pressure? Absolutely. I mean, I think there was there was Doug Burgum who was [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3206.32s)]
*  that that was your favorite, no, Freiburg? Not my favorite. I met him seemed like a really [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3212.0800000000004s)]
*  thoughtful guy. He's done an incredible job managing the state of North Dakota, but he's got some [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3217.52s)]
*  social policy issues that I think are going to rub people the wrong way. And I think to Saxon's [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3223.2000000000003s)]
*  point, he's more in the camp of supporting Ukraine, which it seems like some part of the party [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3228.8s)]
*  are starting to come around and say no. So it seems like he wasn't a great fit ultimately. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3236.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, I met Doug Burgum the other night, and he's a very nice man who I think [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3240.5600000000004s)]
*  great guy play a very important role. Very nice guy who I think can play a major, major role [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3245.28s)]
*  in the party. Incredible business sold it to Microsoft. Yeah, there's nobody who understands, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3249.92s)]
*  I think, energy better and all the regulations that have gotten in the way of making America [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3254.4s)]
*  energy independent and tapping our vast energy reserves. So I found him very, very impressive [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3259.12s)]
*  on that. But at the end of the day, you know, it's it's just not the kind of pick that JD is. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3264.0s)]
*  I remain a moderate undecided voter. I love JD Vance. I think it's an inspired choice. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3270.32s)]
*  I know, Sax, where you're voting, I'll take some guesses on you, Chamath. But Freiburg, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3275.76s)]
*  where are you standing right now? I'm very happy that RFK Jr. was not selected as the VP. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3280.16s)]
*  Why? To be on the ticket. I think RFK would have been a challenging partner for Trump, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3286.72s)]
*  and it would have led to a lot of disagreements. And I think that RFK has some policy perspectives [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3292.96s)]
*  that I don't agree with, particularly as it relates to health, energy, agriculture. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3299.2s)]
*  And so there are some disagreements I have with respect to his view of the world. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3305.8399999999997s)]
*  I will say JD seems like a pragmatist. He seems highly intelligent. He seems highly competent. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3311.04s)]
*  And I know that he has not been in a governing position before. Right. So this is really [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3317.8399999999997s)]
*  critical to note. This is a training job for him in a large way. He's been a senator and [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3322.7999999999997s)]
*  he's been an investor and he's been an individual contributor as an investor. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3330.08s)]
*  And he's built his own firm, but it's not a scaled firm. So this is going to be a really [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3333.6s)]
*  interesting kind of process to watch unfold. But I think from a policy and a strategy perspective, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3339.52s)]
*  he can have a really positive impact on the direction of the things that we talked about [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3346.08s)]
*  earlier, which is accountability and government programs, having a clear set of objectives, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3350.3199999999997s)]
*  making sure that we focus on those objectives and don't spend time and resources on things that are [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3355.44s)]
*  fluff and perhaps aren't really meeting the objectives. And I think that he'll have, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3360.96s)]
*  the thing I do have concern about, I think that the nationalist agenda, the nationalism and the [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3366.0800000000004s)]
*  isolationism agenda is counter to global trade, which can be deeply inflationary. And that is one [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3371.1200000000003s)]
*  concern I do have, which is the ability for the U S to export and import with other trade partners [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3379.28s)]
*  with other trade partners around the world. I think it's critical for us to continue to grow [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3387.04s)]
*  our economy and keep inflation down. So if we take policy action that limits our ability to import, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3391.7599999999998s)]
*  because we impose tariffs on other countries, goods and services, it can be inflationary, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3399.04s)]
*  makes things more expensive for Americans, everyday Americans to buy. When everyday Americans go into [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3404.3999999999996s)]
*  Walmart and they buy products, a lot of those products are shipped from China. So if there's [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3409.2799999999997s)]
*  a tariff on those products and the price of those products now goes up by 30, 40%, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3414.64s)]
*  that can be a real burden that drives inflation. That's the point about the nationalism [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3419.6s)]
*  on manufacturing and input. So Freeburg, you're pretty convinced at this point that the reciprocal [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3424.08s)]
*  trade agreement would cause inflation, hyperinflation? No, no, I think that the [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3429.04s)]
*  idea that the general statement, which I don't think is necessarily how this is being executed, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3436.8799999999997s)]
*  I just want to make sure that we're all cognizant of the point that if you introduce tariffs on [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3440.4s)]
*  imports, it will drive prices up. Now that may be the right thing to do from a policy perspective. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3446.08s)]
*  As we heard from President Trump when we interviewed him, his belief is that this is an [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3452.2400000000002s)]
*  important security stake, that we use it to drive reciprocity and we use it to hold China in check. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3457.2000000000003s)]
*  And so that may be a more important strategic priority over the increase in the price of certain [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3464.48s)]
*  goods. The problem that will arise, and this happened during the last Trump administration, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3469.28s)]
*  if China then responds with tariffs on the export of US agricultural products, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3474.6400000000003s)]
*  so our biggest buyer of agricultural products today is China, and then China put tariffs on [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3480.0s)]
*  our export or they stopped buying from the US and they started buying from Brazil instead, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3484.7200000000003s)]
*  the farmers are hurt. And when the farmers are hurt, the Trump administration [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3490.96s)]
*  had to spend money to support farmers, tens of billions of dollars. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3494.88s)]
*  Yeah, they subsidized it. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3498.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. They paid farmers in a way. And so the federal government then has to step in [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3499.6s)]
*  to meet the gap that arises from what will end up becoming an escalating tariff problem or [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3505.12s)]
*  escalating purchasing problem. So global trade allows the economy to grow, gives everyone a [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3511.2000000000003s)]
*  market, you can start to trade, but there's also these security issues. I do think it's important [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3516.4s)]
*  that we onshore a lot of manufacturing. I think it's important, but there's going to be a period [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3520.96s)]
*  of pain. There's going to be an investment needed and it's not going to be simple and easy. And we [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3524.96s)]
*  may face quite a bit of inflation on the path to doing that. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3529.6s)]
*  Can you give us an update here at the end of the show, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3532.32s)]
*  Freeberg on scholarships and what people have been asking for the Olin Summit? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3534.2400000000002s)]
*  So this week we are opening up scholarship applications. You can go to summit.allinpodcast.co [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3538.2400000000002s)]
*  and we have a very, very, very limited number of scholarship tickets that we hold for the summit [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3543.3599999999997s)]
*  like we did the last two years. The applications are open now. Please get your application in [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3551.44s)]
*  right away because we expect that we'll be completely overbooked almost immediately. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3556.8799999999997s)]
*  And some of those scholarships are going to be sponsored by Athletic Brewing Company. So thank [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3561.04s)]
*  you to Athletic Brewing Company for paying for a lot of our scholarship recipients to go to the [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3564.56s)]
*  Olin Summit this year. Really exciting programming coming together. We have more details to share in [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3568.24s)]
*  the next couple of weeks. And we do have one more last block of GA tickets that we're going to release. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3572.56s)]
*  Get your application in on the website, summit.allinpodcast.co for a GA ticket [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3579.52s)]
*  for the last block. Thank you. All right. Let's just do one quick business story here [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3585.2s)]
*  since we spent the bulk of the episode talking about politics and current events. Exit's creeping [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3588.56s)]
*  back. Sequoia is doing a secondary sale of their Stripe investment, one of the greatest investments [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3595.04s)]
*  of the last decade. And Google is in talks to acquire Wiz. And this is absolutely amazing [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3600.7999999999997s)]
*  news for the industry, which has been suffering from a lack of distributions. As you can see in [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3609.52s)]
*  this chart, Chamath, after 2021, exit values just plummeted. And there are some signs of life now. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3615.2799999999997s)]
*  Let's start with Sequoia buying back some Stripe shares from its own LPs. Sequoia Capital has [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3623.7599999999998s)]
*  invested $517 million in Stripe. That's currently worth about $10 billion. 20X, Michael Moritz, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3629.6s)]
*  led the seed in Series A. Sequoia offered to buy back $860 million in Stripe shares from LPs in [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3636.3199999999997s)]
*  its legacy funds. Those are the funds between 2009 and 2012. Sequoia is using capital from their [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3643.92s)]
*  newer funds, like its Evergreen Fund that was formed in 2021, the Heritage Fund, that's their [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3650.48s)]
*  wealth management team, to give the legacy funds some liquidity. It's not normal that a company [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3655.12s)]
*  stay private this long. It is the exception to the rule. But it has happened, actually happened with [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3661.6s)]
*  Uber to a certain extent. So legacy fund LPs have the choice, Saks, to hold, sell some, or sell all [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3667.2s)]
*  of their Stripe shares. Here's the quote from the note. Sequoia personnel and associated persons [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3675.04s)]
*  will not be offered the option to sell Stripe shares previously received as carried interest [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3679.92s)]
*  distributions from the legacy funds. And they are offering $27.50 a share, which is pretty generous, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3683.44s)]
*  $70 billion valuation. As you may know, Stripe has hit as high as $100 billion in market cap in the [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3688.32s)]
*  private markets. So this will be a, from the seed, which was a 20 million post, a 3,500X for those [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3697.76s)]
*  LPs. And for the Series A, it is a $100 million post, which is 700X for those people who don't [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3706.16s)]
*  know. I think it was Sam Altman who actually did that investment as a Sequoia Scout in the same [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3713.8399999999997s)]
*  fund that I did the Uber investment. So still the number one and two investments there. Your [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3718.16s)]
*  thoughts, Jamoth, on this unique opportunity and device to sell early shares from the same venture [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3723.6s)]
*  fund? I have two thoughts. The first is that it's interesting to see that they [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3730.48s)]
*  marked the valuation up to 70 billion. So that's a good sign for Stripe. But the second thing is [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3737.04s)]
*  I was a little kind of puzzled by this whole thing. It's a very complicated thing when you're buying [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3744.48s)]
*  old stakes into a new fund and crossing funds. It's sort of like actually one of those things [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3752.16s)]
*  that are supposed to be verboten. And when you're trying to build a good fund with great [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3756.72s)]
*  governance, this is actually at the top of the list of the things that you're never supposed to [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3761.4399999999996s)]
*  do, which is to provide liquidity to a group of LPs via another fund that you control. But I think [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3766.48s)]
*  this actually shows what may be going on behind the scenes. So I don't want to be [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3775.68s)]
*  conspiratorial or anything, but it would be a great way for the GPs to get liquid, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3780.08s)]
*  to meet their capital calls here without having to pay capital gains tax. And that makes a lot of [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3786.4s)]
*  sense for the GPs themselves. And so I suspect that that probably- Well, they did say that [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3791.3599999999997s)]
*  the GPs aren't going to get to liquidate anything. So they did put that note in there. So they've [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3797.2s)]
*  anticipated that. Right. So you can provide, you can provide, no, meaning, but what that means is [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3802.4s)]
*  you can provide liquidity. You don't get to pull the money out. That's fine. But then now you can [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3805.76s)]
*  use it to fund capital calls. But I don't like it. I don't like these kinds of things where one fund [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3809.28s)]
*  is basically scratching the back of another fund. It always tends to be the case that this stuff [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3814.8s)]
*  on the surface looks a little smelly and can be a little unseemly. And this is why you're not [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3820.32s)]
*  supposed to do it. You're supposed to go and get some other random fund to buy these things. And [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3827.44s)]
*  I think it's generally a much cleaner thing to do. And the hygiene of it is clearly what we see, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3832.72s)]
*  Sachs, in that documentation, giving people choices. You can make your own choice. We're [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3839.12s)]
*  not taking carry. We're not selling our shares, and we're only selling 10%. So they did go to [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3843.8399999999997s)]
*  extreme measures, I guess, to outline that. But your thoughts on this type of sale? It happens in [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3849.04s)]
*  private equity all the time, I understand. But we don't see an adventure on that often. What are [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3855.2s)]
*  your thoughts on this providing equity to the 14-year-old funds? [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3859.04s)]
*  Dr. Justin Marchegiani Well, first of all, there's a kid rock concert [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3862.64s)]
*  going on behind me. I had to- Dr. Patrick Saunders [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3864.72s)]
*  Sorry, that's distracting for you. Dr. Justin Marchegiani [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3866.24s)]
*  No, no. It's been- it's going to be lit. That's all I can say. If he's introducing [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3867.6s)]
*  President Trump, it's going to be pretty baller tonight. We're taping on Thursday, obviously. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3871.7599999999998s)]
*  This episode will probably come out tomorrow. But in any event, with respect to the Sequoia thing, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3876.88s)]
*  look, I think there's this overarching issue of the fact that VC funds are classically designed [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3881.36s)]
*  to be 10-year funds. The money is called over time, usually over the first few years, it's invested, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3889.28s)]
*  and then you don't get liquidity. I mean, it's not like a mutual fund where you can take your [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3895.92s)]
*  money out. You get liquidity if and when the fund gets liquidity. And these funds are meant to be [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3899.76s)]
*  long-term illiquid vehicles. So like I said, 10 years. And typically, you can get two one-year [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3905.28s)]
*  extensions to the funds. So then the question is, what do you do at year 12, if you still got [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3910.4s)]
*  positions in those funds? Well, I think a pretty good solution is what I think Sequoia is doing [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3915.04s)]
*  here and what I've heard other people do, which is if you have a security that's not public yet, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3920.2400000000002s)]
*  but is semi-liquid because it's a very late stage private company, then what you can do is spin those [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3924.48s)]
*  shares into an SPV or to some other vehicle. And you let new investors come in and buy those shares [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3930.88s)]
*  at some price, and then you give the option to your old investors, do you want to sell or do you [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3940.16s)]
*  want to roll into the new vehicle? So nobody is forced to give up their ownership position. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3945.7599999999998s)]
*  But if they want to get liquidity and there's sufficient demand on the buy side that you can [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3950.56s)]
*  get them that liquidity, it's a really elegant solution. I can't say I know exactly all the [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3955.52s)]
*  details of what Sequoia is doing because they've got this two-tier fund structure that makes it a [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3959.8399999999997s)]
*  little different. But I have seen in other cases, people have distributed shares into an SPV, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3963.6s)]
*  and then new buyers come in, participate, and then the old investors get to decide whether they [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3969.2s)]
*  roll or sell. So it's a pretty good way of handling this 12-year limit. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3975.52s)]
*  And the valuation, just to... Sorry, I didn't clarify. This valuation is based on the last [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3980.96s)]
*  409A. So... That's the one thing about Sequoia that's a little different is, remember, it's their [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3984.08s)]
*  global mega-fund that's buying the shares as opposed to an SPV. Normally, what would happen [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3989.04s)]
*  in terms of figuring out the price is you'd want to use some sort of validated secondary price. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=3994.16s)]
*  But obviously, it'd have to be a market clearing price where new money wants to come in at that [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4000.08s)]
*  price. And this is a little bit different because it's their pre-existing fund that's buying at that [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4004.7999999999997s)]
*  price. And so how do you sanity check the valuation? And I guess I would just want to make sure that [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4010.96s)]
*  that valuation is the secondary... Yeah, it's like the secondary clearing price. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4020.4s)]
*  That's what it's trading at in secondary markets, and that's what the 49A is. So I guess that would [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4023.76s)]
*  be the hygiene there, but it's certainly unique and I guess great for those LPs in less... [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4027.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, we had a similar thing happen with Uber where they did the secondary and [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4034.64s)]
*  they had Masayoshi-san come in and do an IPO, essentially. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4042.2400000000002s)]
*  That's entirely different. Yeah, you had new money coming into your point. So [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4046.64s)]
*  here is the second story related to DPI and VC's getting the cash out. Google is in advanced [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4050.72s)]
*  stocks to acquire Wiz for $23 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. It's an Israeli-American [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4056.96s)]
*  cybersecurity startup that was founded only in 2020, backed by Sequoia Index, Insight, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4061.6s)]
*  and Treason and others. One of the fastest growing startups ever reaching $500 million in ARR in 4.5 [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4066.64s)]
*  years. Google would be paying 46X forward revenue. They think they'll have a billion in ARR sometime [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4072.72s)]
*  next year. And what are our thoughts on this in terms of M&A? You saw it on this AT&T hack [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4080.8799999999997s)]
*  of Snowflake, but cloud security is a really big deal. The more cloud services you have, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4090.3999999999996s)]
*  the more difficult it is to lock these things down. And so whether it's Google or Amazon, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4097.52s)]
*  they have Azure, they each have a really big problem on their hands, which is that [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4102.64s)]
*  if all these customers are convinced to move these workloads into the cloud, but then you can't secure [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4107.6s)]
*  it and you get hacked, that ends the business. So Wiz is an incredible testament to, I guess, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4112.16s)]
*  engineering prowess. I don't exactly know, to be honest with you, the quality of the product. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4118.400000000001s)]
*  Obviously, I don't interact with those kind of products every day, but the fact that they're [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4123.04s)]
*  willing to pay such a premium means A, the product is good, but more importantly, B, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4126.16s)]
*  in the absence of cloud security, these cloud vendors are going to be constrained in how fast [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4131.36s)]
*  they can grow. So what an incredible market. What an incredible, incredible market. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4138.88s)]
*  I have to say these two things have really helped the climate in the LP community. This past week, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4144.4s)]
*  a lot of chatter about IPOs that are getting filed and that we could be ending the drought [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4150.8s)]
*  and people were feeling very, very pessimistic about venture as a category. And I think these [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4157.84s)]
*  two things have changed a lot of people's feelings on that. So good work there. And I think it also [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4164.64s)]
*  signals maybe some regime change. Expectations tax, yeah, LinaCon maybe getting booted when this [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4172.56s)]
*  regime change occurs next year and then maybe more M&A would occur. What's Trump's and JD [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4180.240000000001s)]
*  Vance's position in your mind on M&A and LinaCon, Sax, if you had to interpret it? [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4186.400000000001s)]
*  Well, something that's very interesting is that JD Vance has been relatively positive towards LinaCon. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4194.0s)]
*  He's one of LinaCon's few Republican fans. And the reason for that is because LinaCon, [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4201.52s)]
*  for all of her faults, and we've described them here, has been willing to take on big tech. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4207.28s)]
*  The fact of the matter is that the top handful of tech companies, the Microsofts, the Googles, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4211.44s)]
*  Amazon, these are big tech monopolies. There's just no way around that fact. And they do need [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4217.04s)]
*  to be closely watched and supervised and regulated with respect to their market power. And I do think [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4222.639999999999s)]
*  they use their market power in inappropriate ways, as we've discussed on this podcast. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4229.44s)]
*  I sometimes think that LinaCon, in her approach, has been a little bit more of a cleaver when she [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4233.28s)]
*  needed to use a scalpel. I don't think that she should stop some of these, what I would call R&D [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4238.24s)]
*  acquisitions from taking place where there's no accretion of market share, but rather starts [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4242.639999999999s)]
*  being bought because they contribute a useful piece of technology. I don't think you want to [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4249.28s)]
*  shut down that part of the market. Lord knows we don't have enough exits as it is, like we were [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4253.2s)]
*  just talking about. So I think it would be great if we could massage LinaCon's approach a little [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4257.84s)]
*  bit. But I think that it is a good thing that she's not willing to just roll over and let the big [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4264.24s)]
*  tech companies do whatever they want. And I think JD Vance appreciates that about her. So look, I [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4269.2s)]
*  don't think that LinaCon's going to be running that agency in a second Trump administration, but I [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4273.92s)]
*  think there's going to be a problem- How much of a problem with Republicans, though, [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4281.6s)]
*  facts is the freedom of speech issue and Republicans being banned on the social platforms, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4284.0s)]
*  including it up to Trump. I mean, if that issue wasn't there, I think you would probably see [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4291.68s)]
*  maybe a different approach. Yeah. Well, I think it's a huge issue because the fact of the matter is [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4296.08s)]
*  you've got these tech monopolies who are using their monopolistic market power to put their thumb [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4300.4s)]
*  on the scale of our political discourse in favor of one side versus the other. So obviously if you're [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4306.64s)]
*  on that side of the aisle, you're going to be up in arms about that. You're not going to be happy [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4312.32s)]
*  about that. And I do think that given their market power, they have an obligation not to distort our [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4315.5199999999995s)]
*  democracy by artificially suppressing one side of the debate. So I think that, yes, Republicans [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4322.5599999999995s)]
*  should be up in arms about that and they should be resisting censorship. And JD Vance specifically [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4328.96s)]
*  mentioned censorship in his speech. That seems to be his main issue. I think we'll see under Trump [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4334.32s)]
*  a lot more mid-market M&A if I were to, you know, let's call it under a hundred billion dollars, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4340.72s)]
*  a hundred billion dollar acquisition would be fine with me under a hundred. Well, I really like the [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4346.400000000001s)]
*  part of his speech where he said that in a healthy democracy, we debate ideas and that's good. We [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4350.08s)]
*  even have debates in the Republican Party and that's good. The last thing we want to do is censor [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4354.8s)]
*  the marketplace for ideas. Gosh, I mean, are we going to hear anything like that from the Democrats [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4358.320000000001s)]
*  when they do their convention? Well, in breaking news, as we wrap up this program, the hot swap [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4363.12s)]
*  summer will continue. Apparently Biden is predicted to resign this weekend. We'll see if it [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4367.76s)]
*  happens. Speedrun primary Nostradamus is predicting it happens. Nostracanis. Nostracanis. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4374.0s)]
*  Nostracanis will keep his position. The hot swap is coming. Well, Jake, at this point, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4382.400000000001s)]
*  I think you were right about Biden stepping aside. I thought he was out of the woods. He did that [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4387.04s)]
*  press conference, that NATO press conference where he did make that one mistake, that senior moment [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4393.44s)]
*  where he actually- That chopped with his VP? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4399.12s)]
*  Yeah. Oops. That was the kind of thing where he got his name mixed up, but otherwise he seems [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4400.5599999999995s)]
*  to be finding his footing in terms of talking about policy and the brush fire was put out. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4406.32s)]
*  But then for some unknown reason, he goes on and does that Lester Holt interview. I don't know why [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4413.599999999999s)]
*  they were still letting him do interviews. He should only be reading from a teleprompter [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4419.919999999999s)]
*  and he mixes up, he forgets the name of his secretary of defense, Lloyd Austin, and he just [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4423.2s)]
*  refers to him as the black man. The BET, yeah. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4428.48s)]
*  As a BET interview. So he did the Lester Holt interview, which was not good. And then he did [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4431.599999999999s)]
*  the BET interview, which was a disaster. Well, the money's dried up. Right your mouth. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4435.12s)]
*  So once the money goes, it's over. Yeah. And he also did a horrible one with 360 with Speedy, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4438.0s)]
*  Speedy Mormon, and that was a train wreck. There was a couple of moments there that are just total [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4444.5599999999995s)]
*  gaffes. They say Pelosi and Schumer told him it's over. And I guess that means, and Katzenberg, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4448.56s)]
*  you're right, Jason, when the big money is gone and they make the call, you know, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4456.240000000001s)]
*  yeah, it's done. It's done. Isn't that amazing what we've learned about the Democratic party? [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4460.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, like the coup de grace was basically Katzenberg going in there, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4464.88s)]
*  say, yeah, I can't raise any money for you. And then boom, he's out. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4469.200000000001s)]
*  I am shocked that any political party would be swayed in any way by political donations. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4473.68s)]
*  Enjoy the hard seas, Zach. I love you guys. I got to go. Love you guys. Talk to you soon. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4478.16s)]
*  Four, the chairman dictator, the architect David Sacks and your Sultan of Science who [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4484.72s)]
*  got out a little bit early. I am the world's greatest moderate moderator. We'll see you next [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4490.0s)]
*  time. Love you, guys. Bye bye. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3z73JXD3pYU&t=4495.28s)]
