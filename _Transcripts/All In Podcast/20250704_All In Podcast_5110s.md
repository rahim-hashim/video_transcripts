*  family you can do these two three nine occasions. Yeah, no [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=137.8s)]
*  I'm not. You camp on the side. You eat mid food. Yeah, you [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=140.6s)]
*  don't shower for three days and you four days but yeah there's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=144.2s)]
*  the view from the Snake River. It was absolutely stunning and [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  yeah we camped. Is that where the Snake River is that also [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=152.6s)]
*  where like Snake River Farms comes from? You know the high [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=155.24s)]

*  Farms is not as good as Long Hill Wadview but you know. Yeah, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=167.32000000000002s)]
*  I mean listen these are that's like two elite steak producers [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  get the Kulet aka the Pekania. All right listen the BBB has [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=175.0s)]
*  passed the Senate. Let's get into this docket but there was a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=180.12s)]
*  bit of drama in the house after an all night session and over [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  24 hours of deliberation. Senate passed the big beautiful [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=186.84s)]
*  bill on Tuesday. Friend of the pod JD Vance cast the time [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  breaking vote after a 5050 deadlock three Republicans [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=194.12s)]
*  voted no and Trump won over Senator Ron Johnson on this [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=197.88s)]
*  very podcast. He said he would be a no unless more spending [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=203.8s)]
*  was cut. There were significant changes to the bill. We'll get [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  into that in a minute and so it's got to pass the house [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=209.96s)]
*  again before Trump gets out into law. Lots of drama. Trump [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=213.32s)]
*  set the deadline for July 4th which is Friday when you're [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=216.44s)]
*  listening to this and it will in all likelihood get there [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=218.52s)]
*  according to Polymarket. There is a 96% chance the bill will [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=221.88s)]
*  pass by Thursday and a 97% chance it'll pass by Friday July [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=225.56s)]
*  4th Independence Day the day we publish so it looks like it's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  pretty much a lock some big changes in the Senate biggest [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=233.56s)]
*  change the 10 year AI regulation moratorium which we're [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=237.16s)]
*  going to talk about for states was removed Ted Cruz tried to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=239.88s)]
*  negotiate cutting it to five years suggestion I made maybe [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=243.24s)]
*  10 years was a little bit too long for folks but that didn't [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=246.68s)]
*  work according to an NGO called National Conference of State [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=249.0s)]
*  Legislatures over a thousand bills related to AI have been [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=252.76s)]
*  filed by state lawmakers in 2025 so expect a lot of state by [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=255.56s)]
*  state AI regulation. I think this is a good place to stop we [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=260.36s)]
*  don't have sacks here to talk about AI regulation but he [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=264.68s)]
*  talked about the last time Freberg your thoughts on states [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=268.04s)]
*  you know we talked about state rights here in relation to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=272.6s)]
*  abortion guns gun regulations cannabis many different you [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=275.24s)]
*  know debates over who should get to decide for the country [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=281.96000000000004s)]
*  where do you stand on this one should states have a voice in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=285.88s)]
*  how AI is deployed in their you know borders within their [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=290.2s)]
*  borders or should the federal government take this and if so [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=294.68s)]
*  for how many years because that seemed to be a sticking point. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=297.64s)]
*  Look I'm a big believer in the construct of our Federated [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=301.64s)]
*  Republic in the United States where states can operate with [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=305.88s)]
*  as much kind of discretion as they choose to with the laws [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=310.28s)]
*  that they pass and how they intend to govern. There are [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  however things that affect more than the state we have [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=316.76s)]
*  interstate commerce we have international commerce we have [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=319.8s)]
*  the open internet and we have a lot of other systems at play [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=323.96s)]
*  here that extend beyond the boundaries of a state and the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=328.52s)]
*  way that AI tools and AI systems and AI services and AI related [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=331.56s)]
*  jobs are being deployed and activated. I do think it's [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=335.88s)]
*  critical that we treat AI regulation at a national level [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=339.47999999999996s)]
*  at a federal level to date there have been I believe 70 [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=343.88s)]
*  state laws or statutes passed thus far in the United States [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  with I think over a thousand having been proposed to date if [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=352.28s)]
*  the numbers are right and having a patchwork of [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=355.72s)]
*  regulations on for example model development or telling [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=359.32000000000005s)]
*  software companies what software they can deploy would [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=363.0s)]
*  make it practically impossible for internet service providers [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=365.64000000000004s)]
*  like a Google or an open AI to service customers across state [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=368.92s)]
*  boundaries in a way that is actually going to meet the needs [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  of the customer. This is a huge detriment to consumers and a [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=376.36s)]
*  huge detriment to the job market if we end up creating a [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=380.28000000000003s)]
*  patchwork of regulations on AI this early. One of the things [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=383.4s)]
*  that I would point out is that much of the early legislation [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=387.24s)]
*  like for example what we saw in California if you read that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=390.44s)]
*  legislation that did not get signed by Gavin Newsom in [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=393.24s)]
*  California there was a definition on model parameters [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=396.36s)]
*  being a boundary condition for whether or not something would [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=401.24s)]
*  go through a regulatory review process that was such a naive [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=404.28s)]
*  assertion that early in the phase of AI technology [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=407.71999999999997s)]
*  development and think about the implication was okay well [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=411.08s)]
*  everything is LLMs but there's other models like vision action [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=414.44s)]
*  models are going to be used in robotics models that might be [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=418.84s)]
*  used in predicting and driving physical systems like in self [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=421.64s)]
*  driving cars for example so the way that the regulation gets [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=428.03999999999996s)]
*  written will often be done in a naive context in a limited [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=431.96s)]
*  fashion by regulators that don't fully understand the breadth of [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=435.96s)]
*  the technology that's coming our way and I do think that it [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=438.6s)]
*  needs to be kind of leveled up and allowed to operate at a [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=441.48s)]
*  federal level so I think it is absolutely critical not just for [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=443.96000000000004s)]
*  technology companies not just for the industry but for the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=448.20000000000005s)]
*  opportunity for job creation for improving the economy for [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=450.6s)]
*  driving GDP and productivity growth that we get something [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=453.96000000000004s)]
*  passed that forces AI regulation to be done at a federal level [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=457.16s)]
*  even though I generally agree that states should be able to [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=460.12s)]
*  self govern this just has too much of an interstate and global [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  interaction so that was the biggest disappointment for me and [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  the negotiation that's gone on with this bill is that of all the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=468.28s)]
*  things that I thought were going to be passed that I thought were [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=471.71999999999997s)]
*  maybe not ideal getting this AI federal preemption in that bill [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=475.55999999999995s)]
*  was probably the best thing the top of the list for me in terms of [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=480.11999999999995s)]
*  critically important for the US economy. Yeah Trimoth your thoughts [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=483.96s)]
*  here obviously abortion it's like an interesting one to look at [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=487.71999999999997s)]
*  because that went to the states in furtherance of Freeberg's [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=491.88s)]
*  you know position here you have just many different rules and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=497.88s)]
*  regulations between Texas, Oklahoma, whatever it is everybody's got a [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=502.52s)]
*  different view it's chaotic and we don't have a singular point of [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=506.36s)]
*  view on it therefore women in one state have very different rules [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=510.76s)]
*  than in another state so where did you fall on this one federal [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=514.52s)]
*  legislation or is it just going to take more time to figure this out I [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=519.56s)]
*  mean that that's another I guess angle here you know this is nothing [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=522.04s)]
*  like abortion okay abortion is an individual issue between a woman [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=525.0s)]
*  her doctor her partner her god and so a state being able to have rules [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=533.88s)]
*  and then allowing that woman to choose which state she can go to is quite [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=546.5999999999999s)]
*  reasonable because I think that it acknowledges that there's no one size [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=553.56s)]
*  fits all so that is clearly a state issue but the reality is that AI is of [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=557.4799999999999s)]
*  national security importance it is the tip of the spear of our ability to [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=566.3599999999999s)]
*  have technological supremacy that is how we have economic supremacy and so [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=573.7199999999999s)]
*  not governing it at the federal level I think is a mistake and it makes as much [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=579.48s)]
*  sense for states to legislate AI as it would make sense for states to have [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=586.9200000000001s)]
*  competitive armies it doesn't make sense there are certain things that are just [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=593.0s)]
*  so fundamentally primary to American supremacy and safety and security that [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=598.04s)]
*  it needs to be regulated at the federal level and I think AI needs to be at the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=603.16s)]
*  top of that list so I was disappointed that we weren't able to see the forest [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=607.08s)]
*  from the trees here now I'm sensitive to part of the reasons why many of the [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=612.0400000000001s)]
*  states have very specific issues around child safety that they mentioned in [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=617.72s)]
*  Tennessee there was a lot about copyright ownership related to musicians and their [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=623.08s)]
*  content I get all of that those are legitimate things that need to get ironed out but I think [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=628.2800000000001s)]
*  that it could have been done in a federal framework not having it I think the risk is [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=633.08s)]
*  that if you have 50 different sets of regulation and it won't even just be 50 as Prybrik said it's [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=639.5600000000001s)]
*  going to be you know all kinds of pet organizations that pop up in all of these states what happens [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=645.0s)]
*  I think what it does is it slows down startups and smaller companies who won't have the economic [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=650.76s)]
*  have to fight these regulations or to work with them or to figure it out and it'll advantage a [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=657.8000000000001s)]
*  handful of incumbents and the problem with that is that our incumbents aren't yet mature and this [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=662.36s)]
*  industry is still developing so I think this is this is one of the unfortunate parts of what is [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=669.0s)]
*  otherwise a pretty reasonable bill well you can look at gambling I guess and cannabis legislation [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=674.2s)]
*  these are things that Americans largely want to do and they are fighting their way state by state [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=681.48s)]
*  and at some point we may have a federal regulation about online gambling right right now it's a [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=687.0s)]
*  patchwork same thing with cannabis psychedelics all a patchwork of different states why do you [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=692.36s)]
*  lump together things that are about individual rights with AI which I don't think is I don't [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=698.44s)]
*  think is about that people might look at the rights of rights holders cars these AI things are going [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=703.96s)]
*  to hit people on an individual level so I think when you bring this up this topic there are people [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=710.44s)]
*  who feel this is an individual sovereignty issue right but you know there are other issues of [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=716.92s)]
*  individual sovereignty like the ability to take drugs and there's still federal mandates that [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=722.68s)]
*  come through the FDA you know you're not allowed to short circuit or circumvent that framework [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=726.8399999999999s)]
*  at a state by state level yeah that actually is at the core of the cannabis debate is would they [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=733.24s)]
*  enforce the federal laws on cannabis and they haven't right so that I'm talking about more as [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=738.52s)]
*  it relates to AI sure you know because AI means everything I think that's what makes this issue [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=744.2s)]
*  very difficult AI is going to affect everything right so probably the people who want to slow [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=752.44s)]
*  this down and have the states do it are saying let the states have their say on these granular [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=758.6s)]
*  issues I'm not saying this is my position but I think that's what I'm reading into their position [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=763.4000000000001s)]
*  hey this is going to affect different states in different ways let them figure it out take some [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=767.24s)]
*  time and then we'll build towards a framework nationally which I think is what happened with [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=772.04s)]
*  the internet in section 230 as well although I don't know the entire history of it we did come [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=776.68s)]
*  up with an idea that hey the federal government makes it common carrier to you know anybody can [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=781.24s)]
*  post anything on a website and then you know you can request to take it down that was federal [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=786.5999999999999s)]
*  legislation those things could have been held also on a individual basis and then what would have [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=791.56s)]
*  happened for the internet you would have had to have AOL or GeoCities have a different patchwork [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=796.36s)]
*  like you're saying in regulation so I'm guessing the states probably do want to have a say on [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=801.24s)]
*  self-driving that one specifically and I don't know if they're wrong what do you think on [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=805.96s)]
*  self-driving should it be federal I mean that's like an interesting lens to look at it through [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=810.52s)]
*  I don't know the details well enough it seems to me that self-driving touches both the states and [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=816.28s)]
*  the federal sure federal highways and local roads yeah so but I'm just from first principles [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=821.4s)]
*  you know there's self-driving cars now in Palo Alto going up to the city from Waymo you got [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=828.4399999999999s)]
*  Austin you got three different providers should the city the state have a stay in that kind of [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=832.92s)]
*  feels like they should yeah sure yeah so I mean I think that I don't I don't think a city has any [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=838.6s)]
*  idea how to regulate a model no that's where it's obvious the other side like how would they ever [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=844.28s)]
*  even know and another piece that's in flux and has been changing is energy policy solar EV credits [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=849.96s)]
*  and maybe even disincentives the $7,500 credit for buying cars and then also carbon credits and [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=857.2399999999999s)]
*  a fee of $250 for everybody who owns an EV every year free bird maybe you could talk a little bit [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=867.4799999999999s)]
*  about of this part of the debate because we've been spending and hitting incredible goals as a [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=873.7199999999999s)]
*  country in getting more renewables more energy online but that comes at a cost right and so that [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=879.4s)]
*  is a big part of the debate here and that obviously is something that impacts Elon and [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=885.88s)]
*  we'll get to him in a moment but that impacts Elon and Trump's relationship in a major way [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=891.32s)]
*  the old school motivation and incentive for what people would call green energy or green tech was [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=896.04s)]
*  to decarbonize electricity production and develop and deploy at scale these new technologies at the [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=902.84s)]
*  time like wind and solar as an alternative to carbon-based technologies that put carbon [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=911.64s)]
*  dioxide in the atmosphere like oil and coal and gas so the IRA the inflation reduction act created [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=916.12s)]
*  tremendous government incentives for building solar and wind farms to create electricity in [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=923.88s)]
*  the United States this proposal that's been going back and forth in this bill and some of the debate [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=931.08s)]
*  that's triggered many folks online to denounce the bill takes away those incentives takes away [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=938.28s)]
*  those credits takes away the EV tax credits starting in September as an example why can't [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=945.0799999999999s)]
*  they do these in digestible chunks it should be no more than 300 pages per bill no more than x [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=949.64s)]
*  number of issues and breaking into three good conversation to have good conversation to have [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=956.12s)]
*  another time but we should talk to people on congress but there's a very specific reason why [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=959.56s)]
*  because of the the logjam that happens with the filibuster so it makes it impossible to get things [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=963.64s)]
*  done in that traditional context so what's happened in the last couple years is you end up with these [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=969.88s)]
*  massive massive mega bills where they jam everything into one bill that they can pass with 50 votes [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=973.4s)]
*  and then in the middle of the night they make these last minute changes and then we have no say [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=978.52s)]
*  it's right and so there's dark there's there's no rigorous debate there's no transparency into [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=983.16s)]
*  what's going on and why and so the second argument away from the green stuff is the more modern stuff [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=988.12s)]
*  which i've made and i know chamath agrees with me on this which is we have to increase electricity [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=992.84s)]
*  production in this country the current plan has been to move from one to two terawatts by 2040 [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=997.4s)]
*  meanwhile china's moving from three to eight and china's adding an entire united states and [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1003.32s)]
*  electricity production capacity every 18 months right now they are so far ahead of us and ultimately [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1007.72s)]
*  electricity production is what drops the price for things and increases jobs increases gdp increases [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1012.2s)]
*  your ability to make stuff and so the more electricity production comes online the more [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1018.68s)]
*  we will be able to be sufficient than an ai point now the secretary of energy secretary right gave [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1022.8399999999999s)]
*  an interview and he said we have more than enough capacity with gas oil and coal and nuclear and so [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1029.48s)]
*  his argument at this point is that we don't need to subsidize solar and wind where the government [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1038.36s)]
*  pays for these programs and private equity investors can make money on them this is a big [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1044.36s)]
*  part of the argument he's making i'm not making it but he's saying this will drive traditional [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1048.36s)]
*  energy investments in traditional systems that we can scale up quickly to meet our energy production [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1053.6399999999999s)]
*  goals now i will say from my point of view i'm not a huge fan of being dependent on government [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1058.84s)]
*  subsidized energy at all so if the government is having to play a role in funding stuff there's [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1065.9599999999998s)]
*  something really questionable in terms of our sustainability on that energy production source [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1071.9599999999998s)]
*  over time will it actually be able to make more of it because what you want is not just to make [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1076.84s)]
*  a bunch of energy in the next six years or 12 years you want to make sure that you've got an engine [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1082.4399999999998s)]
*  for creating new energy production on a continuous basis so we climb non-linearly the energy [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1087.72s)]
*  production curve that's what we need to do and i hope that one of the key outputs of this which [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1094.6s)]
*  a lot of people are really unhappy about the loss of the demand for solar and wind because of the [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1100.6799999999998s)]
*  loss of the government programs here but what i'm hopeful for is it creates a natural market [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1106.04s)]
*  force for nuclear and that we actually see a better proliferation in nuclear which secretary [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1111.56s)]
*  right has said and president trump signed these eos a couple weeks ago to reduce the regulatory [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1116.52s)]
*  burden on nuclear and increase the ability for nuclear to proliferate much more quickly than [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1122.68s)]
*  has been the case historically so while a lot of people are saying hey this is going to take away [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1127.0s)]
*  all this energy production capacity that's coming online in the next few years they were supposed to [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1131.4s)]
*  the counter argument is we're going to create a natural market force because the energy demand [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1136.68s)]
*  will still be there so someone's going to show up and say hey i want to make electricity because [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1141.48s)]
*  there's so much demand for it and maybe they say hey let's try this new nuclear dreg system and see [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1144.92s)]
*  if we can get it to work and so i don't know the jury is absolutely out we have not seen [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1150.44s)]
*  this energy proliferation begin in this country but i do think one of the potential benefits [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1156.0400000000002s)]
*  of removing those clean energy tax credits is that we actually see natural market forces drive [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1160.44s)]
*  demand for a more naturally sustainable scalable energy production source sure mafio that's [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1165.0800000000002s)]
*  analysis a few weeks ago but i dipped my toe into real estate i've never done real estate before but [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1171.0800000000002s)]
*  just outside of phoenix we're building a one gigawatt data center that's a 25 billion dollar [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1176.76s)]
*  total investment cycle of which we'll be into it for two or three billion of equity when it's [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1182.8400000000001s)]
*  probably all said and done what i can tell you is the reason why you can underwrite that deal [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1188.76s)]
*  or why i was able to underwrite the deal was it's located downstream of a nuclear reactor and so [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1194.1999999999998s)]
*  there's effectively infinite energy that we can tap but we still need nat gas and a bunch of other [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1201.3999999999999s)]
*  things the problem is that you know if we put it in order right now we can't get a nat gas turbine [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1205.56s)]
*  viable and turned on until 2030 it's not a technology issue it's purely a supply chain [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1212.04s)]
*  issue so i think what our energy policy needs to make sure we contemplate is that many of the [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1217.1599999999999s)]
*  things that we are debating are no longer issues of production but they're issues of supply [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1222.6s)]
*  transmission and distribution and as long as we can make sure that we [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1228.28s)]
*  allow energy to be made wherever and whenever possible and then stored however much we can [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1235.8s)]
*  however possible we'll be on the forward foot the big risk is that if we [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1241.5600000000002s)]
*  don't have that ability and then all of a sudden we have these incredible achievements in technology [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1248.44s)]
*  in robotics and we don't have the electricity to power them that's the big risk as long as we can [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1254.44s)]
*  fix that i still worry that with nuclear the issue won't be the federal regulations i think that it's [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1261.0s)]
*  good that the president cleaned it up the real problem is going to be the local and state [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1267.4s)]
*  regulators and how quickly they're willing to turn these on and the reality is that you know [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1271.16s)]
*  these are 10-year projects and so even if you say go from today the earliest these things can be [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1276.1200000000001s)]
*  turned on really in 2032 2033 that's far too late and that's a lot of risk too chamath because [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1281.48s)]
*  what if you get blocked at the last minute this is where solar and other projects you know we're [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1287.4s)]
*  probably solar as well i'll tell you a story in 2020 right before the pandemic [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1293.72s)]
*  i mean i don't even know if i should say the name of the company but i almost went after a coal [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1300.92s)]
*  company to buy it and i had been obsessed with this company for a year and it was cheap it fell [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1305.08s)]
*  on hard times it was like a billion two a billion three and my team went up in arms they were like [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1311.0s)]
*  oh my god it's so dirty you can't own a coal company and it was such a huge miss on my part [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1317.0s)]
*  i should have just bought the bloody thing then we went into covid then you know everything went [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1322.68s)]
*  upside down and lo and behold that company is like quintupled since then so i'm a fan of all forms [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1326.28s)]
*  of energy production i think the marginal cost of energy has to go to zero which means that [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1332.2s)]
*  any single way you can get your hands on electricity production is a winning trade [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1336.6000000000001s)]
*  over the next 20 years in the united states this is i was trying to wrap my head around people [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1344.1200000000001s)]
*  saying oh we shouldn't buy all these solar panels out of china because china is making them so [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1348.68s)]
*  cheaply and our trade imbalance etc and i was like well wait a second what's more important the trade [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1354.04s)]
*  imbalance and giving china some money for solar panels we're getting more solar panels to arizona [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1358.8400000000001s)]
*  you know to utah look let's take the subsidies off the table ultimately you don't want any of [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1365.24s)]
*  these markets subsidized the reality is it is faster and more efficient to put solar panels up [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1370.44s)]
*  and start generating electricity it's just that it's like 17 months from start to finish [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1377.0s)]
*  17 months so that's probably in my opinion the single most valuable underwriting feature of solar [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1382.6s)]
*  which is you put a dollar in you can start generating revenue in 17 months from that dollar [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1389.88s)]
*  going in that's very different than when you're putting a dollar in and you're not going to see [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1395.08s)]
*  it back for a decade plus that's scary and so you need to generate a rate of return that justifies [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1399.48s)]
*  a 10 or 15 year investment cycle and that's hard to do because there's a lot of volatility in the [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1406.1200000000001s)]
*  world and things can go you know down as well as up so i don't know my perspective is get rid of [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1411.96s)]
*  all the subsidies at this point create a clean slate but don't do anything to hinder the production [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1417.48s)]
*  of electricity because we need literally as much of it as we can get our hands on and then we need [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1423.8s)]
*  to find a way of storing it in a safe way and then we're off to the races and the battery technology [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1429.56s)]
*  freeburg is just keeps making great incremental process progress in terms of cost you know just [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1435.24s)]
*  going down what 15% i have a question for you yeah how many days a year do you think california [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1442.1200000000001s)]
*  is in an energy deficit how many days a year is california in an energy deficit doesn't have [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1448.44s)]
*  enough energy it would be during the summer you know where the electricity prices go crazy where [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1455.16s)]
*  they have to find all kinds of ways of generating massive amounts of base load [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1460.52s)]
*  like a third of the time 100 five that's it wow yeah so we've really made so we you know in [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1465.48s)]
*  california our grid is on average about between 45 and 50 utilized this is for pg and e i don't [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1472.28s)]
*  know what it's like for socal edison yeah down south but the point i'm trying to make is that [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1480.04s)]
*  in normal market conditions for residential we have tremendous amounts of power and for most [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1484.1200000000001s)]
*  needs we have tremendous supply so things can be pretty good the problem is all of the stuff [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1489.24s)]
*  downstream from the making of it and if we don't clean that up we're going to create these [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1496.6000000000001s)]
*  artificial constraints that will come back to bite us when we really need the power to do [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1501.24s)]
*  something very exciting yeah all right uh let's move on to elon and trump's relationship everybody [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1504.92s)]
*  wants to hear our take on what's going on between elon and trump in relation to this bill we took a [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1512.52s)]
*  pass on it last time but we'll take a swing at it now obviously there's been a bit of back and [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1518.04s)]
*  forth between two of our friends friends of the show both elon and trump are are you friends with [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1524.28s)]
*  trump jacob well i'm speaking on behalf of the show um i have never met trump in person but i [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1531.8799999999999s)]
*  did interview him here i'll be out of me and sex i'm on behalf of the show you guys are all [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1537.72s)]
*  team trump it's pretty obvious sex yeah i'm your team from too elon has i've never met the guy [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1543.08s)]
*  you've never met never been in the white house it's a pinch was in the white house with everybody [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1550.1999999999998s)]
*  nothing i never really never met in person okay spent time in the white house but didn't meet him [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1554.36s)]
*  okay no problem yeah anyway elon has come out hard against this bill he tweeted it is obvious [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1558.12s)]
*  with the insane spending of this bill which increases the debt ceiling by a record five [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1564.28s)]
*  trillion dollars that we live in a one-party country the porcupine party time for a new [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1568.6s)]
*  political party that actually cares about the people this escalated a bit but this isn't as [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1573.7199999999998s)]
*  bad as the first time around when asked if he would deport you on trump said i don't know we'll have [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1578.4399999999998s)]
*  to take a look and said he might stick doge on elon since he gets a lot of subsidies freeberg [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1584.52s)]
*  we skipped talking about it because it was uh i think a bit chaotic last time but this time i [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1591.0s)]
*  think maybe we'll chime in a bit things aren't as hot right now and the bill is going to get [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1596.84s)]
*  through so let's take a swing at it what are your thoughts freeberg on the kerfluffle the donny [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1601.0s)]
*  brooke the brouhaha between elon and president trump there's a lot of people that are making [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1606.6s)]
*  accurate declarations that federal spending needs to be reduced the deficit needs to be shrunk [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1613.6399999999999s)]
*  we are in a debt death spiral and they are absolutely correct so i don't think that elon [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1619.8s)]
*  is off the reservation when he makes those comments and he's talked about this continuously and he [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1626.68s)]
*  dedicated months of his life to operating doge and trying to bring to light some of the extraordinary [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1632.3600000000001s)]
*  operating inefficiencies in the federal government that should be addressed and i think you know we'll [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1639.96s)]
*  see what happens jury's still out for those actions to get permanent they i believe need [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1644.12s)]
*  to mandate them in a appropriations bill and the white house has publicly declared that they are [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1650.76s)]
*  going to move forward in an appropriations bill to try and cement some of the doge actions so [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1655.9599999999998s)]
*  i'm hopeful but i think elon's right with respect to the spending i will provide the voice i have [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1662.36s)]
*  heard publicly stated from the alternative view from the white house which is this is not the [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1669.1599999999999s)]
*  bill to do that because it mostly focuses on these mandatory spending programs and they are addressing [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1674.76s)]
*  cost savings to some degree in these mandatory spending programs while keeping the tax rates [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1681.08s)]
*  where they are or reducing tax rates in some cases which the expectation is will stimulate gdp growth [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1687.1599999999999s)]
*  so the white house view is also a view that you could look at and say economically i could see a [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1694.2s)]
*  path here that does make sense you're reducing spending only on mandatory programs you're going [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1700.52s)]
*  to come back with an appropriations bill to address discretionary spending and then the final kind of [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1704.52s)]
*  action that the white house might take which we've heard about separately is impoundment [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1710.1200000000001s)]
*  that at the end of the fiscal year they may come back and say all the money that we saved by not [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1714.2s)]
*  spending it we can actually recover through impoundment and the cbo has not accounted for [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1718.36s)]
*  tariff revenue and just looking at the recent deal done with vietnam vietnam's about 130 billion [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1726.36s)]
*  dollars a year of imports to the united states and they did a deal that they announced two days ago [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1732.9199999999998s)]
*  with a 20 tariff on vietnam which you know if vietnam's import volume does not increase it's [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1739.24s)]
*  about 26 billion a year of incremental revenue for the federal government so there's an argument [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1745.8s)]
*  that besant and lutnik and others are making that you guys have failed to recognize that we've got [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1752.28s)]
*  a few other things we have up our sleeve that we're going to do we're going to do impoundment [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1757.6399999999999s)]
*  we're going to do this appropriations bill we've got more revenue coming in net net we will get [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1761.8s)]
*  the deficit down to where we need to be in fact scott besant was on tv saying over and over we're [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1766.04s)]
*  going to get the deficit below three percent of gdp which is the key target here but the immediate [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1770.84s)]
*  reaction to this bill i think that elon is having is the same that i've had and it is the same that [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1776.28s)]
*  senator johnson had and is the same that many others have had which is what the f are we doing [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1781.08s)]
*  we are in a fiscal emergency in this country and we're not addressing it so i think both points of [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1785.8s)]
*  view can be valid and both sides can have a good kind of argument for why the bill should be passed [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1790.76s)]
*  and why the bill shouldn't be passed the white house has declared that this is the only way [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1797.48s)]
*  they're going to get some of the programs done that they believe they need to get done [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1801.24s)]
*  for national security like the ice border stuff and these are things that they believe they need [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1805.16s)]
*  to get done but a lot of folks are looking at the numbers and saying this just isn't enough and [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1809.8s)]
*  you're now increasing the deficit by cutting taxes one of the things the cbo does not do though [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1814.76s)]
*  is they don't have a strong model and there's a ton of economic debate on this point which is how [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1820.28s)]
*  to tax cuts stimulate gdp growth and job creation and income growth for people with jobs the one [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1825.72s)]
*  argument is when you cut taxes more dollars flow into the economy more jobs are created more [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1832.28s)]
*  businesses are created the gdp grows income for other people grows the alternative argument is [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1839.0s)]
*  it's a tax cut for the rich what are you doing they're going to put that money in their pocket [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1844.1200000000001s)]
*  it's only going to benefit themselves so that's i think a key crux in the argument that you'll [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1847.96s)]
*  never get to a resolution on the one side will use that one argument and the other side will [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1853.72s)]
*  use the other argument so look i mean with respect to elon and trump i will say one thing very [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1858.28s)]
*  importantly i don't think magga can exist successfully without the tech alignment i [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1863.88s)]
*  don't think tech can exist without magga because of the government alignment and the importance of [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1869.4s)]
*  the government allowing these new technologies like ai to come to market and to proliferate i [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1875.08s)]
*  don't think that these two can exist in isolation and in conflict with one another [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1881.0s)]
*  elon is the de facto king of tech he is the person that is saying look if i'm in conflict [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1885.64s)]
*  with trump tech is in conflict with trump or at least that is the perception on the magga side [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1891.24s)]
*  and i think that that is very risky for both sides to allow a conflict to kind of endure [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1896.44s)]
*  and i do think that both sides have heads that are going to be cooler that will prevail here [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1902.76s)]
*  and i do think that these two are going to recognize the importance of being [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1908.2s)]
*  codependent if you will in being able to progress their respective agendas [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1912.12s)]
*  jamath your thoughts on the kerfuffle seem to be winding down and maybe reaching some sort of [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1916.9199999999998s)]
*  end game it feels like we're in some sort of an end game here and if there is one what is it [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1925.56s)]
*  i mean i think it's just important to recognize that on the one side you have the most powerful [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1929.32s)]
*  person in the world and on the other side you have the most important powerful entrepreneur [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1938.04s)]
*  and richest man in the world and when you have people that are that accomplished [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1943.0s)]
*  it's not as if you're going to get along 100 of the time so i think a lot of the [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1950.2s)]
*  breathlessness around all of this stuff is overblown i think the reality is that [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1955.08s)]
*  when push comes to shove i think that they agree on more things and they probably disagree [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1960.6s)]
*  and i think when everybody realizes that the alternative is essentially [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1967.8799999999999s)]
*  some insane form of socialism and redistribution [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1975.7199999999998s)]
*  and i think the alliance will hold and that they'll find some common ground jason what do you think [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1980.04s)]
*  well i think you're right these two individuals are used to speaking their mind and they're both [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1989.8s)]
*  really good at social media and then there's no better media cycle than covering the two of them [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=1994.76s)]
*  battling it out and trading barbs but i think what elon did this cycle was really interesting [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2001.32s)]
*  he started a preference stack for trump and that cascade preference cascade preference stack [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2007.64s)]
*  however you want to phrase it you know i think played a large role if not the role in getting [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2015.16s)]
*  trump elected people can debate that i don't know that you can perfectly know what that 250 million [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2020.5200000000002s)]
*  dollars and all that effort he put in you know what that did in terms of trump's chances trump [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2026.1200000000001s)]
*  probably would have won anyway versus kamala but maybe not putting that aside the platform elon has [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2032.2s)]
*  refined during this political cycle is one that resonates and i think it's a really good idea [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2038.6000000000001s)]
*  for him to maybe if he's going to be involved in politics pull that string and just crisply define [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2043.88s)]
*  it and i was thinking about it over the last couple days and i think it hits into four basic groups [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2049.48s)]
*  balanced budget and government efficiency that's kind of one fiscal responsibility sustainable [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2057.72s)]
*  energy which obviously has been passionate about and he's the leader in solar batteries evs [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2062.9199999999996s)]
*  and then manufacturing in the united states which he also is the leader in and pro-natalism and just [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2067.48s)]
*  you know the uh the population crisis he really cares about those four issues so what i think [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2072.7599999999998s)]
*  he should do is take that america pack and instead of making it like just pro-maga he should just [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2078.04s)]
*  clearly define what it is that he believes small set of issues and then you should go and back [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2083.96s)]
*  the people who are running to to be in congress and senators and just say hey here is what i would [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2090.52s)]
*  like you to be in favor of and do what norquist did with his no new taxes pledge do some sort [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2097.0s)]
*  of pledge like that i don't know if it needs to be a new party but just really crisply define what [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2102.52s)]
*  matters to him if he's going to be involved in politics then get people to agree on it and if [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2106.84s)]
*  he wants to give them donations as it's his right as is his tax right to raise money he could [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2112.04s)]
*  represent i think a very world positive view sustainable energy just incredible execution [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2117.08s)]
*  and a really efficient government he should get technical excellence technical excellence excellence [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2123.16s)]
*  writ large and just go for it and and it doesn't have to be personal against trump one of the big [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2127.56s)]
*  problems with trump is he he has a bunch of sycophants around him and the more you kind of [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2133.72s)]
*  appease him and just blindly follow him i think the closer you the perception is that's the closer [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2139.64s)]
*  you get to him i don't know that that's true i think he likes debating stuff so i think he should [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2145.16s)]
*  embrace the people who debate it with him and then those people should just crisply say here's what [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2150.2799999999997s)]
*  i stand for and i'm putting my money behind it i hope we're in alignment but i'm going to stay in [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2154.52s)]
*  my lane and i'm going to prioritize what matters to me and elon's priorities are exceptionally sharp [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2158.8399999999997s)]
*  and well defined and he should pursue them yeah juries out on where this ends up and the broader [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2165.24s)]
*  picture you guys will get annoyed because i've talked about ray dalio so much but i think he's [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2171.3999999999996s)]
*  done an amazing job in the last five years basically explaining everything we've seen from global [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2178.9199999999996s)]
*  conflict to the internal conflict the rise of socialism in the u.s and the relationship to the [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2185.72s)]
*  debt and deficit cycle he just posted on twitter yesterday that he went to dc to discuss the budget [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2190.52s)]
*  deficit with senior people on both sides of the aisle and he said it's clear to me that we are [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2196.68s)]
*  unlikely to change the debt trajectory we're on and avoid the painful consequences and he talked [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2200.92s)]
*  a lot about this concept of absolutist politics and this is the same reaction i've had every time [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2205.64s)]
*  i've gone to dc and we've met with members of congress and if you guys remember from the [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2210.04s)]
*  beginning i said doge isn't going to be it as much as elon can identify and resolve to a better way [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2213.7200000000003s)]
*  of operating the federal government's agencies you cannot change the spending without a change [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2219.24s)]
*  in statute from congress you have to get congress to act and every time i met with members of [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2224.68s)]
*  congress their incentive is to keep the money flowing to their districts that's what they [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2229.0s)]
*  focus on and every year their districts want more in different contexts in different forms [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2233.3999999999996s)]
*  through different programs and that's what their job is their job is to go to dc to represent their [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2238.2s)]
*  state's interest or their local district's interests and say we need to make sure that [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2242.68s)]
*  we're taken care of as the money flows and as a result everything keeps getting bigger and bigger [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2246.28s)]
*  and spiraling away at the end of the day the way we economically save america if we even have a [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2250.52s)]
*  shot without money printing which a lot of people like bollogy and dalio and others are now indicating [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2255.48s)]
*  is what's going to happen is we're going to end up inflating away or printing away [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2261.0s)]
*  all of the debt that we've taken on is to get to a 333 which besant has highlighted is also his goal [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2264.52s)]
*  three percent federal deficit to gdp three percent gdp growth and three percent inflation [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2270.04s)]
*  and just to give you a sense of where those numbers sit today the current estimate is six percent [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2276.84s)]
*  deficit to gdp 2.4 percent inflation so we've actually got a little bit of room to run [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2281.16s)]
*  on inflation and gdp growth this year of 1.4 percent so will the tax cuts in this bill [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2286.2s)]
*  increase gdp growth will ai increase gdp growth the jury is out will the tariff revenue reduce [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2293.7999999999997s)]
*  the deficit more than the cpo is estimating and the increased gdp growth reduce the deficit the [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2300.52s)]
*  jury is still out and what will happen with inflation and if the fed cuts rates you're going [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2305.3999999999996s)]
*  to see inflation climb a little bit more maybe the tariffs effect on inflation will still come [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2310.7599999999998s)]
*  through some folks have said that hasn't hit yet but it will come later this year will we exceed [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2315.08s)]
*  three percent inflation tbd so the jury is still very much out on whether these actions that are [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2320.44s)]
*  being taken which besant has declared is going to get us to that 333 number but then a lot of folks [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2326.04s)]
*  who are looking at this with a cold stare with like no political influence with no political [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2332.52s)]
*  intention not representing a party not representing an administration like ray dahlio are saying what [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2338.76s)]
*  the there is no way we're going to get to her apology i think you know pointed out in his tweet [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2344.6s)]
*  his point is actually a very good point which is our debt is not just the federal debt but there's [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2350.44s)]
*  other debt that we're not even accounting for consumer i said i've said this in the past there's [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2356.68s)]
*  there's actually corporate debt yeah the business debt consumer debt there's also state and local [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2361.16s)]
*  debt and then the one key number that we never talk about is the unaccounted for liabilities [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2366.92s)]
*  public pension funds which is on the order of trillions of dollars more so when you add all of [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2373.0s)]
*  this up someone's going to pay the bills on all that debt or we're going to have to inflate away [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2377.8s)]
*  that debt by printing money and at some point the trains left the station a lot of people are saying [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2381.88s)]
*  we're done there's no way out of this so you know the elon trump battle is like an interesting kind [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2386.36s)]
*  of side kerfuffle but it's not really the big story here the big story is the trains left the [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2391.88s)]
*  station you know i think if we're if we look at this as the first year that tech really [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2396.84s)]
*  got actively involved in politics obviously peter teal has been at this for a little bit longer in [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2402.2000000000003s)]

*  sax or tl or elon or countless other people you know what is jd vance's position on this when [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2426.92s)]
*  he runs for president in four years what will these other individuals dean phillips who've had [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2433.96s)]
*  on the program if he decides to run i think this is you know we're maybe five percent into the [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2438.6800000000003s)]
*  impact this could be having and already and in freeburg i always give you a lot of credit for [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2444.6s)]
*  this two years ago and you said you started bringing this up incessantly on the program and [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2449.56s)]
*  to the point of it was during it was during covid i started doing this yeah it was three years ago [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2453.48s)]
*  and um you know like yeah i mean you're to your you're admitting you've been annoying for three [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2458.84s)]
*  or four years i think actually it's it's the it's the sand that might make the pearl in the oyster [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2464.68s)]
*  we need to address this it's become a top issue of our time that's actually success the fact that [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2470.52s)]
*  this issue is now the issue of our time our budget our fiscal responsibility austerity [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2476.36s)]
*  that's actually a really good thing and yeah maybe it doesn't get manifested in this bill [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2482.92s)]
*  but maybe it will get manifested in jd vancess you know presidential run or dean phillips or the both [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2487.8s)]
*  of them will be discussing it in three and a half years or three years when they're on the [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2492.84s)]
*  presidential trail so that could be actually the early sign of success for this i'm an optimist [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2497.56s)]
*  good luck so you're sure in the cap that it's over yeah i mean we sit here and we parked on this [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2502.2s)]
*  topic dozens of times we keep talking about oh we need to do this we need to do that but at the end [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2510.12s)]
*  of the day when the bills get passed when congress takes action you get to see where their heads [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2515.3199999999997s)]
*  really at and i do think that this bill has indicated that the administration has a set of [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2522.52s)]
*  incentives which is they want to get the actions done that they promised they would on the campaign [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2528.92s)]
*  trail and then congress has a lot of incentives to keep the money flowing and i think we've seen that [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2532.84s)]
*  in this negotiation to get this bill done and i'm not faulting anyone for it congress is looking out [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2538.1200000000003s)]
*  for the interests of the people that they represent and the white house is looking out for the people [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2543.0800000000004s)]
*  that voted for them and they said this is what we're going to do and we have a mandate and now [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2546.92s)]
*  they're getting it done and that's just the way it is but this is the key part of the whole storyline [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2550.92s)]
*  which is at some point once the spending levels get too high and the country the individuals and [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2555.96s)]
*  the businesses become too dependent on that spending yep which is effectively what happens [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2561.16s)]
*  at the end of every empire you can't back out you can't stop spending and everyone just votes [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2565.96s)]
*  themselves the dollars so it's a it's a scary moment and i've said it before i do think that [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2571.48s)]
*  the gdp growth is the one path that's left to resolve this i don't think we're going to just [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2576.44s)]
*  cut spending and so we need to kind of be really thoughtful about making sure we don't hamper gdp [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2580.44s)]
*  growth particularly as it relates to ai which is going to unlock a lot of new industry a lot of [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2585.56s)]
*  new growth a lot of new opportunity for jobs and this is why i worry a lot about this patchwork [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2590.04s)]
*  of regulation in states making it really difficult for ai you only need five more people like rand [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2594.84s)]
*  paul and tillis right if you get a couple more of those chamath this could be a completely different [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2600.2s)]
*  discussion if you want to pivot to the next topic i mean one way to look at this is how the dollar's [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2605.72s)]
*  trading yes the u.s dollar is now down 11 this year and that's against every single major currency [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2610.28s)]
*  here it is so the dollar was down over 10 through the first half of 2025 this is the worst start in [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2616.6800000000003s)]
*  over 50 years take a look at this chart and you can see it it's kind of shocking keep in mind the [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2623.0s)]
*  dollar jumped seven percent after trump was elected it kind of peaked in mid-january so if you take [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2629.4s)]
*  the pre-election dollar index number 103 it's down six percent since then not record-breaking [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2634.84s)]
*  but significant and obviously economists are saying tariffs and global trade are a big piece of this [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2640.2000000000003s)]
*  and as we just discussed and we'll keep discussing the u.s debt load at 37 trillion dollars it's more [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2648.36s)]
*  expensive for americans to travel abroad and it's less attractive maybe to invest in the u.s let me [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2655.88s)]
*  just follow up on the point i just made but this is where where the you know the what do they say [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2661.88s)]
*  the chicken comes to roost chicken chickens come home to roost yeah the chickens have come this is [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2666.6800000000003s)]
*  the rubber meets now yeah this is where you start to see the inflationary effects of the spending [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2670.76s)]
*  and the spiraling debt as things get more expensive and your earning power doesn't increase commensurate [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2675.4s)]
*  with the higher expenses so so what will happen is you'll see here the u.s today imports four to [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2681.7200000000003s)]
*  five trillion dollars a year so that's four to five trillion dollars that u.s consumers and [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2686.7599999999998s)]
*  businesses are buying from abroad and then we import into the u.s and use those products [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2691.64s)]
*  and services so the cost of all that just went up by 11 percent as the dollar declined in value [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2696.52s)]
*  against the average of all these currencies and that's outside of increase in prices that may [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2702.2s)]
*  arise because of the tariff effect where folks may say hey let's charge more for tariffs whether [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2706.2s)]
*  it's the cost of tariffs or the cost of the debt the dollars that you have to spend now just went [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2710.04s)]
*  up by 11 percent to buy the same thing and if that compounds and that continues and your earnings [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2714.36s)]
*  are not growing and your assets are not growing commensurate with that that's where dollar [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2721.1600000000003s)]
*  devaluation happens and where asset devaluation and income devaluation and that's where again we [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2724.36s)]
*  open up the door to a thing like socialism where people are like it's now twice as expensive to [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2729.08s)]
*  buy my groceries it's twice as expensive to pay my rent and i'm not making any more money man [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2733.56s)]
*  i need a solution we got to get together and get the government to make everything free and that's [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2738.6s)]
*  why i'm so convinced that there's a rise in socialism in this country because in this sort [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2742.92s)]
*  of an inflationary environment like we're seeing so far this year you don't see it in the dollar [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2746.92s)]
*  inflation numbers you see it in the dollar currency numbers you're gonna say man i need [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2750.44s)]
*  an alternative that's why the paradox to that is free stuff is not free it means increased [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2755.4s)]
*  spending which means you're stalling the plane even more so exactly drop any thoughts here on [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2761.2400000000002s)]
*  the dollar i think the dollar is devalued 50 in the last 35 or 40 years so [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2767.16s)]
*  i think it's somewhat useful to look at any single couple of months in time but [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2777.0s)]
*  this has been a one-way trade for a very long time and it's probably important to understand why that [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2782.92s)]
*  is and i think it generally has to do with the fact that the united states finances a lot of [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2789.88s)]
*  growth and that has been the right decision so unless you see a complete collapse in the currency [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2798.2000000000003s)]
*  i suspect that this decay continues to happen so the question is is it a bad thing and the answer [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2807.88s)]
*  is it depends because if asset prices increase faster than the dollar devalues you're still ahead [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2815.4s)]
*  you may not be ahead as much but you're still ahead and if you look at asset prices in the [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2822.52s)]
*  united states relative to asset prices any place else in the world it is the flight to quality [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2827.4s)]
*  which is to say that it is the thing that everybody wants to own and you see that in [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2832.6s)]
*  the equity markets you see it in real estate you see it in hard assets [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2838.92s)]
*  so i don't know i think that it's part of the fact that until we run surpluses and or completely [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2843.32s)]
*  eliminate the debt there will always be a reason to be somewhat short the dollar but the reality is [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2851.4s)]
*  that a lot of people still want to own these assets more than what they want to own any other asset [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2858.04s)]
*  and those assets are dollar denominated and so as long as that continues to hold in the push and pull [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2862.6800000000003s)]
*  it'll be a slow bleed but it's probably manageable and that's just sort of like the [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2870.44s)]
*  mathematical trend of it all so i don't know unless there's some like cataclysmic collapse [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2876.36s)]
*  in asset prices i think that this is just a thing that you have to deal with it's sort of like the [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2882.12s)]
*  carry of it all and it happens there's all kinds of other trades where you sort of pay a carry [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2888.2000000000003s)]
*  and that's okay is there a relationship you can explain to the audience between the stock market [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2892.76s)]
*  ripping and the dollar devaluing well i think the reality is that you know if you think about a [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2897.72s)]
*  country that all of a sudden has to pay a tariff so let's take the vietnamese example that freeburg [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2903.0s)]
*  said let's just say that they had to prepay one year of it just to make the math simple so you [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2911.72s)]
*  can understand they have to come up with 23 odd billion dollars i think is what freeberry the [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2915.7999999999997s)]
*  number that you said or something like that so yeah like 26 billion on 130 yeah how do you do [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2921.0s)]
*  that well the first thing that you're going to do is you're going to sell dollar denominated assets [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2925.64s)]
*  that you already own and you're going to generate those us dollars and then you're going to send it [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2929.48s)]
*  to the united states treasury so you may be selling bonds so you would think okay well [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2933.72s)]
*  that's not really good for asset prices okay but then what you quickly realize is that all of that [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2940.44s)]
*  is far outweighed by the fact that all the rest of the stuff that you own whether it's gold [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2946.6s)]
*  denominated or whether it's in local currency denominated you want to actually go and buy these [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2952.36s)]
*  dollars because you want assets that are safe in turbulence and volatility and so would you rather [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2956.84s)]
*  belong the vietnamese dong or the vietnamese equity markets to a degree yes but if you have obligations [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2962.44s)]
*  that the vietnamese government needs to fund their central bank is probably deciding that they need [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2970.04s)]
*  to belong u.s bonds and fixed income and other people who hold assets in that country are probably [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2974.92s)]
*  going to be you know on a weighted basis adding exposure to the united states while all of this [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2981.56s)]
*  stuff is happening why because you're seeing the balance sheet of of america burgeoning and growing [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2987.72s)]
*  23 billion from vietnam tens of billions over here tens of billions over there it all adds up [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=2994.7599999999998s)]
*  so again i think that this is like a very complicated multivariate problem but the net [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3000.04s)]
*  takeaway is that the dollar devaluation is not something that's new it is a phenomenon that has [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3006.12s)]
*  existed through market cycles for 50 plus years it's a decay that has happened and will continue [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3012.3599999999997s)]
*  to happen so i think the way that i think about it is there's a drag but can the drag be overcome [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3018.6s)]
*  by the increase in asset values of the hard assets that are dollar denominated and the answer is [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3025.96s)]
*  yes and meaningfully so and so as long as that's the case i think you're going to continue to have [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3032.36s)]
*  a bid for equities if all of a sudden the mag seven decided to delist and not be american [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3036.52s)]
*  companies and all of a sudden showed up in the cac 50 in france yeah we'd be in big trouble [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3042.76s)]
*  but i don't think that's going to happen and so as long as you know there's american ingenuity [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3048.6800000000003s)]
*  and american supremacy again which goes back to the other thing which is we can't kill these [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3053.2400000000002s)]
*  golden geese nor should we kill the emerging and growing golden goose which is ai and as long as [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3058.36s)]
*  those things are the same there will be a constant bid for american assets and that will keep the [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3064.76s)]
*  enterprise of america going for far longer than most people would guess up to a point but pull up [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3070.28s)]
*  pull up this chart that i think this is the yeah i think that this is why buffett sort of speaks [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3076.84s)]
*  about this in these extremely long arcs that you're always ultimately going to be on the wrong [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3081.56s)]
*  side of the trade betting against the united states and it's probably important to then say [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3088.12s)]
*  well what would a boundary condition be i don't think the boundary condition is the dollar i [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3093.7999999999997s)]

*  exceptionalism speaking of american exceptionalism harvard is still battling it out with trump [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3230.6s)]
*  and their 50 billion dollar endowment is being questioned and it actually relates in many ways [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3238.44s)]
*  to what we're seeing in private companies tech and vc it's going to take a little bit of a [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3245.96s)]
*  circuitous route to get there since trump has been inaugurated harvard borrowed 1.2 billion due to [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3250.52s)]
*  uncertainty around their federal funding remember trump administration canceled over two billion [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3257.64s)]

*  admissions mandatory actions to combat anti-semitism harvard has declined to do a deal so far [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3282.28s)]
*  and uh you're right might remember house representative elise stefanik she asked the [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3289.2400000000002s)]
*  scc two weeks ago to investigate harvard's financial disclosure so she got into the [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3294.6000000000004s)]
*  disclosures when they set up that one point whatever billion dollar line of credit and loan [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3299.96s)]
*  they did a bond deal i think they should like 750 million dollars of bonds yeah so those 750 million [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3307.48s)]
*  bond offering on april 9th was sent out and six days later they sent out a supplemental disclosure [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3313.56s)]
*  with more information about the white house civil rights investigation which she claims [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3319.88s)]
*  it's painted jason a more dire financial picture harvard's cooked and i think this is really good [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3323.6400000000003s)]
*  for america explain it turns out and there's been a lot of people that's posted about this on x [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3328.84s)]
*  but there continues to be rampant title nine violations with respect to admissions i think [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3335.08s)]
*  creme you can probably find it i think he published one that columbia was continuing to discriminate [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3341.32s)]
*  against asian students harvard's original case was against asian students there was a bunch of [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3348.76s)]
*  woke stuff at other ivy league schools like upenn there's all this rampant anti-semitism it all [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3355.56s)]
*  needs to get fixed and so i think that if you get a deal done harvard will have to capitulate [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3360.52s)]
*  i think president trump holds all the leverage and all the cards and there's nothing mathematically [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3369.0s)]
*  that harvard can do they can stall for probably another year and a half but at some point they [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3374.2799999999997s)]
*  will not have the budget to sustain themselves and they're going to get into a huge world of hurt [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3379.32s)]
*  what they will have to do in order to finance their budget in probably 18 months [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3386.52s)]
*  is start to actively sell their private equity portfolio which by the way from 2019 to this year [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3390.92s)]
*  almost doubled from 20 to 40 percent so an insane asset allocation frankly an asset misallocation [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3397.48s)]
*  at the top of the market to the most illiquid asset class and when people sniff this out what [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3406.04s)]
*  they're going to do is harvard was able to sell a billion dollars recently of private equity stuff [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3412.12s)]
*  and managers that they didn't want to support anymore at a seven percent discount there is no [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3417.72s)]
*  smart money on the street that's going to look at any private equity portfolio from harvard without [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3423.88s)]
*  asking for 20 25 30 35 40 percent discount because your back will be totally against the wall and if [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3427.88s)]
*  you don't ask for that you're just a bad businessman so if you put all of these things together they're [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3434.3599999999997s)]
*  going to need to reestablish federal funding but in order to do it i think the president's been very [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3441.24s)]
*  very clear and for whatever reason they've refused to want to address these issues but the ivy league [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3445.72s)]
*  there's just something fundamentally broken well and freeburg the wall street journal reported on [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3451.4799999999996s)]
*  wednesday that harvard would face a billion dollar budget shortfall every year if trump followed [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3458.3599999999997s)]
*  through on his funding cuts and tax hikes he was also saber rattling that he would get rid of their [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3463.24s)]
*  non-profit status or maybe change how the endowments worked a lot of tools i think that [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3471.0s)]
*  he could deploy here and uh oh there's an excise tax by the way in the bbb that taxes foundation [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3476.7599999999998s)]
*  assets i don't know what the final language was but there is a there was a version that i saw where [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3485.56s)]
*  excise tax on foundations was upwards of eight percent a year i don't know if that was the final [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3490.3599999999997s)]
*  version but that's an enormous amount let's just say it's half that let's just say it's four percent [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3494.7599999999998s)]
*  but if you're paying four percent tax on your endowment every year it all of a sudden starts [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3498.68s)]
*  to add up that's like you know for harvard like two and a half extra billion dollars a year that [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3504.12s)]
*  they have to pay and uh freeburg reportedly harvard is at the table and in discussions with [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3508.52s)]
*  the white house after a couple of months of defiance what's your take on this is this an [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3515.56s)]
*  important priority for america and for the trump administration is it a sideshow what are your [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3521.08s)]
*  thoughts on the larger ramifications of this let me just suspend the brand and history and legacy [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3527.16s)]
*  of harvard for a second sure and just talk about these call them prestigious higher education [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3533.24s)]
*  institutions what are the two primary functions of these institutions the first is to educate [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3539.96s)]
*  students and the second is to conduct research or to create facilities for research remember these [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3545.0s)]
*  institutions do not direct research they recruit and enable researchers who apply for grants to [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3550.12s)]
*  get funding to do their research and then they educate kids i think the internet was the first [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3559.48s)]
*  leg on the stool to break higher education the internet democratized access to information and [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3565.4s)]
*  knowledge you can watch mit graduate courses all of the core kind of educational content that is [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3572.12s)]
*  delivered in prestigious higher education institutions has been largely democratized [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3579.48s)]
*  and is broadly available for free on the internet that's an incredible transition that's happened [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3585.88s)]
*  for humanity for society for the world ai is the next leg of the stool to break and i think that [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3590.52s)]
*  ai may actually break education it may break higher education and then eventually it may make [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3596.44s)]
*  its way all the way down to childhood in terms of rethinking from first principles how do we educate [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3602.68s)]
*  how is an individual getting educated and what are the other benefits they get from an educational [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3609.72s)]
*  system besides just core domain knowledge there's also socialization and experience with project [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3614.04s)]
*  based work but i think that ai fundamentally rewrites the ability for an individual to get a [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3619.2400000000002s)]
*  good quality education and we could see kids in africa and kids in south asia getting the equivalent [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3624.6s)]
*  of a harvard graduate school degree at a cost of zero through personalized tutoring enabled through [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3630.76s)]
*  ai the ubiquitous access to knowledge and information so that core function of the [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3635.8s)]
*  university i think is broken and they're now starting to reconcile what that actually means [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3640.6000000000004s)]
*  for the long-term viability of all of these higher educational institutions in the united states the [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3647.0800000000004s)]
*  research function i think is also being rewritten around the world in europe and in china and in [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3653.7200000000003s)]
*  asia there are independent research institutions that get research funding that can show up and [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3658.92s)]
*  say hey this institution is just being used to run research it doesn't necessarily need to be [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3665.08s)]
*  within an educational framework it can be an independent research institution that focuses [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3670.36s)]
*  on either a topic or a domain so i do think we're going to see more and more independent research [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3675.08s)]
*  funding happening with the grants that come out from the federal government from non-profits from [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3679.48s)]
*  endowments and foundations that fund research so i think that there's a real reckoning underway [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3684.52s)]
*  it's almost like these guys have created a monopoly they've accumulated this capital which [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3690.2799999999997s)]
*  allows them to build these great buildings attract these great researchers and then get the research [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3694.04s)]
*  funding to fund those researchers and then use that to raise more capital in their endowment and [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3698.44s)]
*  build the next building and keep this thing growing and i think that that's breaking i have one question [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3702.84s)]
*  for you i like where you're going with this but there's one whole that i would like you to address [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3706.92s)]
*  which is i don't think any of that is nearly as valuable to most of the kids applying or the [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3712.52s)]
*  parents forcing the kids to apply as it is brand and then the cycle that employers put back so that [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3720.76s)]
*  how do you fix that loop yeah well i get it like you can youtube your way to something and you can [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3726.76s)]
*  ai your way to something but at the end of the day goldman sachs loves to recruit from harvard and [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3735.0800000000004s)]
*  that's a really big deal because that's a wonderful company i think the teal fellows program has [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3741.32s)]
*  highlighted that you don't get exceptional performance by exclusively going to people [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3747.72s)]
*  that have higher education degrees from prestigious institutions the teal fellows program which for [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3752.8399999999997s)]
*  those who don't know offered significant funding to kids that are coming out of high school 18 [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3757.3199999999997s)]
*  year olds and i think the teal fellows jason you probably know better than i do what they've created [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3762.7599999999998s)]
*  right like yeah a lot of startups and no but like amazing startup yeah but how do you deal with [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3766.68s)]
*  500 million kids graduating the year globally with no with no brand differentiation i think [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3773.16s)]
*  that's an important question so how did teal fellows do it and how do you hire tamar you just [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3778.84s)]
*  did a program for 80 90 to define people right here yeah well yeah i mean we we did a coding challenge [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3783.4s)]
*  i guess what i'm saying is though that well so what's the alternative to that coding challenge [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3792.84s)]
*  i mean yeah no no the best way to determine freeburg to answer your question the best way [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3796.52s)]
*  to determine if a person can do a job if you don't want to outsource it to a logo like harvard or [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3800.28s)]
*  stanford which are have worked in the past is to watch them do the job that is the number one day [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3806.28s)]
*  to do it and the way to do that is to hire them for projects and or do internships and that means [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3811.7200000000003s)]
*  you have to invest in what's called professional development and that slows companies down so the [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3816.84s)]
*  hack is to just pick a logo but i for example in our venture firm created a training program for [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3821.2400000000002s)]
*  associates and we invested in that and we hire three at a time and two of them make it on typically [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3827.0s)]
*  sometimes just one who hit our notes and the other ones move on and so i think you have to invest [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3833.08s)]
*  in your own professional development in your organization and the organizations that do that [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3840.36s)]
*  then succeed and have a massive competitive advantage because they have their own training [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3843.96s)]
*  program and way to evaluate talent that's one way doing a codeathon and scoring people is another [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3848.6s)]
*  way sure having an ai interviewer is another way so you can interview 10 000 kids instead of [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3855.64s)]
*  interview the 50 that you chose out of harvard because harvard is your first filter so the real [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3860.44s)]
*  question to moth is like what are the mechanisms by which employers are going to create new [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3865.0s)]
*  filtering systems and i think that there's a lot that we just we just kind of went through three [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3869.0s)]
*  examples but i don't know if the brand holds over time well here's the thing that what you're saying [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3873.24s)]
*  doesn't address there are just a lot of kids that aren't ready to bloom when they're 18 or 19 or 20 [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3877.64s)]
*  or 21 and i'm not sure that you know i'll just take myself as an example i was a marginal [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3884.76s)]
*  performer in university but i had co-op i did well in co-op jobs those co-op jobs were because [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3893.2400000000002s)]
*  these employers only wanted to recruit from the university of waterloo now if i had to compete [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3900.92s)]
*  with 50 000 kids i'm pretty sure i would not have gotten it because i was a bit of a layabout but [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3905.7200000000003s)]
*  then you know when i got into the professional working world after a couple of years everything [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3912.44s)]
*  just kind of clicked so i think the the problem that we'll have is in the absence of brand [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3916.68s)]
*  it's just going to be very difficult to differentiate oneself and filter people and i think the j what [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3922.52s)]
*  jason says becomes the huge problem which is then the burden of professional development [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3927.88s)]
*  for all these young kids is extremely heavy so i think that the idea of all of this tooling is good [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3932.92s)]
*  and it's necessary but i think it's insufficient there's something else that we need [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3940.28s)]
*  because i think that being able to differentiate yourself in a coding challenge is not the future [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3944.92s)]
*  either it's for a very very narrow class of person look project-based work social adjustment there [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3948.84s)]
*  there there are clearly other really important skills and development cycles that are needed [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3955.4s)]
*  for people it's not just dumping knowledge into your brain this isn't like the matrix where you [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3961.32s)]
*  can just turn on the knowledge and gain it and so i do agree i think that there are other systems [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3964.92s)]
*  by which that will happen and those systems will will will output filters i'm just not sure [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3970.04s)]
*  it's the same system that we've used for the last 250 years it's not i think that's the the really [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3974.52s)]
*  interesting part of the discussion we've got to freeberg is that we had an incredible system [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3979.0s)]
*  of a series of layered i you know iconography that indicated hey you get 10 people from this group [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3984.04s)]
*  100 from this group and you slot them in and hey your company's going to operate and then [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3992.04s)]
*  parents don't have to worry the students don't have to worry nor do the companies in this new [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=3997.0s)]
*  world the companies have an opportunity by creating professional development and you know what [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4001.4s)]
*  the people who couldn't get into harvard because they didn't have the connections they weren't [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4006.6s)]
*  legacy or they didn't have the wherewithal to pay for sat tutors or whatever bullshit that it took [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4009.64s)]
*  to hack your way in and have a legacy family member or whatever racist policies they had [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4015.4s)]
*  didn't let asian people in because they didn't have the right personalities all that nonsense [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4020.12s)]
*  goes away and that actually benefits their grades were too good right exactly the performance was [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4024.6s)]
*  too high it's so in all fairness you did too well it's like the dumbest thing i've ever heard [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4031.4s)]
*  but here's the good news anybody can build a project in the world and refine their skills [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4036.6s)]
*  right now based on all the information that's on the internet and you and i chamoff are part [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4041.48s)]
*  of that group of people we made our own luck we made our own projects we had some level of grit [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4046.68s)]
*  and autonomy and self-reliance to do that and you know the feedback i got from our previous [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4052.52s)]
*  discussion about this is everybody talking about how poor people as a group can never ever strive [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4059.16s)]
*  and never build anything the truth is it's the easiest it's ever been to build a company to [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4066.68s)]
*  build a project and to be independent as a creator of a product or service in the world [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4072.28s)]
*  it's the easiest it's ever been it requires the least capital and the least amount of time [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4078.52s)]
*  so we're selling a narrative to people that they're helpless when in fact they are super [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4083.88s)]
*  super empowered the only thing you can't do is put yourself into 200 000 in debt because you'll [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4088.68s)]
*  never get out of it i actually think this is a huge beautiful opportunity to reset the system [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4094.68s)]
*  but it's not going to be like going to a you know a supermarket and picking the brands you want and [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4100.92s)]
*  then filling positions you're going to have to be self-reliant for all the students out there and [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4107.24s)]
*  that's what peter teal got right you got to give a shout out to peter teal here i think freebird [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4111.96s)]
*  when he did the teal fellowship the way they picked people was their they had a mission to [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4115.96s)]
*  accomplish something in the world and they were making progress towards it that's actually the [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4120.44s)]
*  criteria they used did you have enough inner resolve to actually pick a mission and did you [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4124.04s)]
*  actually do anything to steer yourself towards it and when you make it a competitive you know sort [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4131.24s)]
*  of program like that they just pick the people who pick the most interesting missions and had [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4136.36s)]
*  made the most progress but there's definitely going to be a hole left in society if these degrees do [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4141.799999999999s)]
*  not correlate with performance and reality all right on tuesday grammarly i'm a huge fan of that [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4150.04s)]

*  in their ipo that would match core weave that was the biggest tech ipo of the year so far [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4219.0s)]
*  and we are on a heater circle went public that was up 7x from its ipo peak and chime went public [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4223.400000000001s)]

*  i was an angel investor and they just filed to go public yum yum and a bunch of m&a transactions [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4237.4s)]
*  we talked about door dash made two purchases sam waltman bought two companies at open ai [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4243.719999999999s)]
*  and tons of m&a happening at the same time according to polymarket 52 chance of a rate [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4249.96s)]
*  cut in september 46 chance of no change so we're definitely not getting an increase according to [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4256.679999999999s)]

*  you know curveball thrown into the system which is i think what most of us thought [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4269.16s)]
*  and tramath you talked about all this sideline cash sitting there in money market accounts [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4274.44s)]
*  markets at an all-time high uber blew past 88 so i should be retired right now what are your [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4279.799999999999s)]
*  thoughts on m&a ipos feels like man we've got a really frisky hot market right now [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4285.16s)]

*  and that biden maybe was putting a headwind against all this you know so here's the crux of [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4299.16s)]
*  the issue i think this is the intersection of a lot of really interesting things happening right [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4304.599999999999s)]
*  you have meta giving individual human beings 300 to 500 million dollar packages like their [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4308.36s)]
*  nba first team all-stars open ai their revenue numbers just leaked they're forecasting 13 billion [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4315.88s)]
*  in 25 2025 spiking to 125 billion in 2029 you have anthropic their revenue by 2027 [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4324.76s)]
*  is forecasted to be about 35 billion so what does all of this tell you to be honest it's telling me [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4337.64s)]
*  that the state of software is a little unclear meaning i actually believe the open ai and [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4347.96s)]
*  anthropic numbers i understand why facebook is now spending as if there's an existential risk and i [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4357.160000000001s)]
*  think the existential risk is that these models could be so foundational to how social experiences [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4363.48s)]
*  and work are done that it starts to absorb a lot of other stuff so the question is how do other [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4370.36s)]
*  tools fit into a workflow when these things become so central to how people both enjoy their free time [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4377.719999999999s)]
*  as well as spend their productive time and i think when you look at that you look at figma [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4386.84s)]
*  what i would say is on the surface in the absence of these ai businesses i would say man what a [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4393.64s)]
*  gangbusters business growing by 40 something percent a year at this scale they're adjusted i [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4398.68s)]
*  think operating margins are 18 i don't like adjusted because it's adjusted for stock based [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4404.52s)]
*  comp i don't know what it is when you add that back in but the point is it's a phenomenal business [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4408.52s)]
*  the question that i think the institutional investor will have is what am i buying [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4414.28s)]
*  and does this revenue growth sit adjacent to core model revenue growth because the big question that [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4419.24s)]
*  we have yet to answer and this is not a figma specific issue it is an industry-wide issue [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4429.5599999999995s)]
*  is how much do these foundational models absorb into what they do for what you pay them and i [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4435.0s)]
*  don't think we know the answer to that yet so if all of these things just become excellent coding [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4441.32s)]
*  tools then all of this high-level software is free and clear right it's it's it's in the safe zone [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4446.44s)]
*  but i think the problem is we don't know that that's the case you know and so i think in the [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4453.639999999999s)]
*  ipo what you're probably going to see is people approach this company the same way that they [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4458.04s)]
*  approach all non-core ai ipos which is that it's a business that you love to own for a year or two [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4463.96s)]
*  but if there's a depression in valuation it's because people cannot underwrite years three four [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4474.84s)]
*  and five freeberg do you believe that the star trek communicator just double click on your pendant [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4479.4800000000005s)]
*  ask the computer to do something means there's one piece of software in the world that does [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4488.6s)]
*  everything and all this long tail of business software just goes away and if so on what timeline [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4493.56s)]
*  no okay yeah i mean this speaks to revenue quality revenue stability i think you used the term how [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4501.400000000001s)]
*  brittle is it chamath what are your thoughts on tramot's angle here of that unknown where would [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4508.76s)]
*  you fall either way are we going to have a suite of products or does it yeah i mean i think i'm [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4515.72s)]
*  more narrow well it depends for what application i think figma has done a classic like land and [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4521.5599999999995s)]
*  expand in terms of who they initially go after and then what the suite of tools that they offer [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4527.4s)]
*  does by expanding that they now can offer a bunch of different people within an organization [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4534.44s)]
*  a set of tools to help them all collaboratively develop products and services and you can see that [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4540.759999999999s)]
*  in some of the numbers revenue growth is on the order of 40 some odd percent they ran a 43% [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4546.12s)]
*  operating cash flow margin in q1 so in q1 of this year figma generated 95 million dollars [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4551.5599999999995s)]
*  of free cash flow they've got net revenue retention of like 130% so this land and expand [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4558.5199999999995s)]
*  has proven out and there's real durability it looks like to this business for now but to chamath's [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4564.36s)]
*  point like what is three to four years from now look like does this get absorbed into chat gpt [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4569.32s)]
*  you could say that about any software at any point in time i think the thing that makes this [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4573.4s)]
*  ai era different is that that transformative shift can happen overnight or suddenly someone [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4577.4s)]
*  else launched the service it's completely obvious another service because of what ai can do but i [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4582.92s)]
*  think figma has done a great job staying out of the curve the free money i think trade instead of [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4587.24s)]
*  having to bet up or down jason on ai i would if i could get like 50 or 100 million dollars of figma [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4591.48s)]
*  i would probably long it and i would short an equivalent quantum of adobe and i would just [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4597.719999999999s)]
*  book the spread and i think you make a ton of money that way that's a safer trade because [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4602.52s)]
*  you know even if the ai model thing comes around the corner we don't see it the person who's going [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4607.400000000001s)]
*  to take a retrade on valuation faster than figma will be adobe and so you'll be hedged and you'll [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4612.120000000001s)]
*  probably make money that way we look at something in terms of not just the quality of revenue in [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4617.400000000001s)]
*  our investment firm we look at the durability of it like can this exist two three four years from [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4622.84s)]
*  now and is the value accruing so much to the user that the amount they're paying they just never [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4628.6s)]
*  think i should swap this out i should replace it right and the revenue durability of your iphone [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4635.8s)]
*  is a good example of it despite people not renewing your your phone every year you still can't think [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4640.84s)]
*  there's no better option than an iphone right now even my google pixel nine fold as great as it is [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4647.72s)]
*  it just feels like that revenue is still durable i wonder when it becomes less durable can i push [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4652.84s)]
*  back on this i think that the i think the question that it brings up is not whether the individual [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4657.96s)]
*  person can whip out a card and pay for it in four years it's whether that individual person [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4662.84s)]
*  actually exists and so that consumer with that amount of money to spend no no no no meaning like [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4668.12s)]
*  we don't know what the layoff cycle and the pattern of layoffs inside of companies may be with ai [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4675.56s)]
*  meaning if we all become more generalized skilled workers and there are maybe many many many more [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4682.2s)]
*  companies then the odds are more likely that you provision highly skilled vertically specific work [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4691.16s)]
*  to a set of agents yes if that's true then the tools that created incredible durability [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4699.96s)]
*  when the organizational chart of a company supported vertical specialization won't exist [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4708.2s)]
*  when instead you have horizontal capabilities that you work across an example i think that that's the [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4714.92s)]
*  big question that ai will will bring to bear and again it's not going to be overnight but that's [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4724.5199999999995s)]
*  where people will front run those trades in the market specifically if they sniff this out [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4731.32s)]
*  we'll want to price that 24 and 36 months forward and say this is what the end state looks like [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4737.48s)]
*  a way to sort of for people to understand that is imagine you outsource hr and you don't have a [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4743.4s)]
*  six-person hr company like you talked about two years ago and then you don't need hr software [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4749.32s)]
*  right so your point each group has a set of sass software and tools it uses if that group goes away [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4754.44s)]
*  because it's just abstracted into the ai machine outsourced there's nobody to buy it in the [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4761.64s)]
*  organization there's nobody going to the cfo saying i need this hr software i need this project [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4767.4800000000005s)]
*  management software i think it's a really interesting point and the way as you for a [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4771.64s)]
*  founder of freeberg to avoid this is to have you know a product that services many different needs [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4775.72s)]
*  for those customers or that organization i think that's why i like these tools like coda notionist [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4781.64s)]
*  they kind of infect many different departments in the organization right this has been [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4786.92s)]
*  an amazing summer episode of the all-in podcast we weren't going to do it this week but we said [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4791.400000000001s)]

*  reinforces the value of the ledger because you'll just run the ledger infinitely forever you may [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4868.44s)]
*  have to have an infinite lead never settle never settle i was thinking my proposal for the ledge was [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS76GPJAKq0&t=4871.8s)]
