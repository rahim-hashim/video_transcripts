# E114 Markets update whipsaw macro picture, big tech, startup mass extinction event, VC reckoning
**All In Podcast:** [February 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY)
*  All right, everybody. Welcome to the All In Podcast. We're back. Thanks to Freeberg and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=0.0s)]
*  Sax for moderating the show into the lowest ratings in its history. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4.32s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. Please give the keyboard warriors that are their bot armies some respite [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=12.16s)]
*  here. They tried their best. It just didn't work. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=18.68s)]
*  They just did. It's okay. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=21.16s)]
*  I think the ratings of the last episode must be a result of Google downranking us as a [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  result of our honesty about not wanting to get more boosters. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=26.76s)]
*  You're on the Brigadoon train. Because somebody at Google, some lower level [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  functionary to push a button to shadow ban, I mean, visibility filter us. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=34.56s)]
*  It's everything except the moderation skills of the two Davids. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=39.88s)]
*  Yeah, no way it's the moderator turning it into Fox Sunday. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=42.2s)]
*  Can't be that. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=44.96s)]
*  The reaction I got from our COVID vaccine discussion was, hey, pretty fair and balanced. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=57.76s)]
*  Like not in a in a joking way, but like actually like, yeah, the warning on YouTube was pretty [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=66.84s)]
*  benign actually. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=71.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's like if you want COVID information, click here. Thank you. Okay, let's talk about [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=72.12s)]
*  the market data. The Fed raised 25 basis points. The market obviously has ripped since then [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=75.88s)]
*  the jobs data. This morning was crazy. We added 517,000 jobs more than 2x December and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=80.48s)]
*  well above the estimates of 188,000 jobs. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=90.76s)]
*  The Fed I think is starting to realize they can obviously impact inflation and slow down [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  speculative assets, but they're having a very hard time with the labor market. Obviously [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=101.48s)]
*  participation actually is growing. We've talked about that many times here. It's bumped up [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  to 62.4%. We all know it peaked at like maybe 69% during the 2000 time period. Wage growth, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=110.8s)]
*  though, continuing to slow. So that is some good news there. And obviously risk on assets [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  are ripping the last couple of days. Tramoth, what's your take on where we are with the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=125.16s)]
*  market and the Fed's action, which people are starting to believe will be another 25 [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=130.04s)]
*  basis point hike and then maybe staying high for the rest of the year? Did you hear their [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=134.52s)]
*  comments? You think dovish? What's your take on the market? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=140.24s)]
*  I watched Powell's speech and it was really amazing because in December, he was extremely [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=142.96s)]
*  hawkish and he was basically like, listen, we're going to keep rates higher than you [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=151.4s)]
*  like and longer than you want. And that was pretty clear and the markets reacted. And [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  then not but 35, 40 days later, he essentially said we have 225 basis point hikes left to [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=161.72s)]
*  go and he's going to try to stick the landing essentially. And even though the rest of the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=169.24s)]
*  language in his entire speech and the press conference, if you read it in the absence [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=176.0s)]
*  of his body language, so if you just read the transcript would seem very hawkish as [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=181.76s)]
*  well. But the reality was he basically capitulated and then the market essentially said, okay, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=185.96s)]
*  we're at the end of this thing. And we've talked about this before, but markets tend [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=191.68s)]
*  to bottom six to nine months before it's clear that you could have done this. And so we're [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  a little bit off to the races in the short term. It's compounded by a couple of other [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=202.16s)]
*  factors. One is that at the end of last year, so many people were tax loss harvesting, which [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=206.36s)]
*  means if you had some gains somewhere else, you sold some things that were losing money [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=211.72s)]
*  so that you could net the two together. You saw a lot of stocks, Tesla was probably the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=215.52s)]
*  poster child for this trade all the way down to like, $108 a share, and it's effectively [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=219.56s)]
*  doubled in the last 30 days, right? So everybody tax loss harvested, everybody degrossed, nobody [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=225.0s)]
*  was really owning anything. And then when Powell basically said we're mostly done, there's [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=230.2s)]
*  been so much systematic buying right now that nobody's really well positioned. To me, this [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=235.72s)]
*  is very similar and eerily reminiscent of the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019. And [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  if you guys remember, at the end of 2018, October, November, December, the markets just [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=247.23999999999998s)]
*  fell. And part of it was Powell's going to raise rates, inflation is getting out of [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=252.64s)]
*  control, etc, etc. And then we got all this data that said China may be entering a real [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=257.96s)]
*  period of malaise. And Powell capitulated, again, trying to stick the landing. And long [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=263.48s)]
*  story short, he didn't. That was a head fake. And the markets just ripped higher. Then we [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  went into the COVID pandemic and all that stuff happened. So I think we're about to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=276.44s)]
*  replay a little bit of that at least in the next 30 to 90 days. The pain trade is to go [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=280.84s)]
*  up. So that's probably where we're going. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=286.04s)]
*  Here's the Fed Fund rates chart from 2000 and into the 2008 recession. And you see just, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=288.0s)]
*  you know, to Trimot's point in 2019, that little step up to 2%. And then this dramatic step [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=294.44s)]
*  up that we've been on up to four and a half or so. Saks, is this where the Fed pauses? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=301.52000000000004s)]
*  You think they cut? And what overall effect is this going to have on venture capital on [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=309.32s)]
*  the startup market, which is super important to us? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=314.0s)]
*  I think we're in the whipsaw economy here. Just a month ago, sentiment was incredibly [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=317.36s)]
*  negative. On the show, we were predicting for the year that we were looking at the Fed [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=322.72s)]
*  Fund's rate going from four and a half percent to say five and a half percent to 50 point [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=327.0s)]
*  increases. The belief was that we were going to have a recession later this year. I think [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=333.12s)]
*  that was pretty much consensus. And now three weeks later, you had a situation in which [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=339.48s)]
*  we got a couple of really good inflation reports. So all of a sudden, the consensus changed [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=344.6s)]
*  to we're not going to need to raise rates to five and a half percent. Maybe we only get [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=348.92s)]
*  one or two more quarter point rates. And the market just ripped on the belief that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=354.72s)]
*  inflation was in the rear view mirror. The problem had been licked. And now we can just [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=360.24s)]
*  kind of move forward. And the Fed seemed to confirm that just yesterday with a quarter [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=365.0s)]
*  point rate increase. And now today, we have this wild jobs report with over half a million [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=370.52000000000004s)]
*  new jobs. The expectation was only 100,000. And so now all of a sudden, people are [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=377.08000000000004s)]
*  wondering, wait a second, does this mean that labor costs are going to go back up, that [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=381.96s)]
*  the economy is overheating, and now the Fed's going to have to raise more? So I would say [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=386.59999999999997s)]
*  literally from week to week, we're being whipsawed between expectations of whether [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=390.68s)]
*  inflation has been conquered or not, whether the economy is going to have a recession or [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=396.35999999999996s)]
*  not. And I think probably where we're sitting at this moment is you'd have to say that the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  risks of inflation returning are slightly higher, but the risks of a recession are slightly [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=408.12s)]
*  lower. Because with this kind of jobs report, better chance of having a soft landing here. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=413.04s)]
*  It's very hard, in other words, Sachs, to have a recession. If people are employed, if [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=418.68s)]
*  people are employed, you're down to 3.4%. Yeah, exactly. So 50 year low. Right. So I just [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=423.72s)]
*  think that we're in a highly volatile economy. And it's very hard to predict the future. I'd [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=430.92s)]
*  say that relative to where we were a month ago, you'd have to say that the odds of us having a [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=436.88s)]
*  soft landing this year are quite a bit better than they were just a few weeks ago. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=443.52s)]
*  All right, Freberg, when we look at this employment picture, it does seem people are going back to [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=447.6s)]
*  work. It seems maybe indicative of people blew through their savings. We talked about this, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=452.48s)]
*  you've been harping on and on previous episodes about people doing personal debt, buy now, pay [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=456.56s)]
*  later, is a possible thesis here that people yoloed for so long post pandemic Coachella, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=462.0s)]
*  vacations, etc. That maybe they whip through their savings, it seems like we've burned off [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=469.12s)]
*  a trillion in savings or something like that, and the debt's going up. So now people maybe need to [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=474.32s)]
*  go back to work and they're finally capitulating and taking jobs. Do you think that's what's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=478.0s)]
*  actually happening here? I don't know if I would classify that. I mean, there's obviously a lot of [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=482.48s)]
*  this stuff is on the margin. The one challenge, you know, Larry Summers has been harping on since [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=487.2s)]
*  last spring, all the way through the summer and the fall. And, you know, in multiple kind of [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=492.56s)]
*  interviews and publications, he's done he's the ex US Treasury Secretary, obviously, brilliant [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=500.15999999999997s)]
*  economist, that the US needs to have a five to 6% jobless rate for five years, in order for us to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=505.84s)]
*  really get to the inflation rate target of two to 3% or below 2%. And so, you know, the economists [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=512.16s)]
*  and the macro guys that are tracking their jobs report today are the I think the indication is, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=519.92s)]
*  we're not there yet. And that the implication of a tight job market is wages go up and wages go up, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=526.64s)]
*  inflation goes up and because companies need to charge more because they have to pay more to get [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=533.92s)]
*  talent. And this obviously continues to support the escalatory spiral that drives inflation. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=537.76s)]
*  So that's the, the, you know, kind of downside to the jobs report today, that I think a lot of [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=545.12s)]
*  folks are watching. The Fed mentioned over and over again, deflation. So any impact there, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=550.8s)]
*  Shamath, you think we're going to see prices start to crater? What impact would that have on the [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=555.52s)]
*  market? I think Sachs is right. I think the marginal risk here is is for this whipsawing. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=560.8s)]
*  So we have a period now which is disinflationary. But the problem is if the stock market keeps going [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=566.08s)]
*  up, and all of a sudden we have less restrictive monetary conditions, then we're going to be back [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=572.96s)]
*  at the same place we were before, which is money sloshing around into all kinds of risky assets, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=578.8800000000001s)]
*  or more money, you know, there's still an enormous amount of money sitting on the sidelines that has [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=585.5200000000001s)]
*  to come into the market now if this thing keeps going higher. So we're in a delicate moment. And [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=590.0s)]
*  if we reignite inflation, because all of a sudden, more companies have more liquidity that they can [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=595.44s)]
*  tap, right, more money they can raise more money as a result that they can spend. Because we don't [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=602.08s)]
*  have this first inflationary cycle under control, there could be a risk that that we reignite [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=608.48s)]
*  inflation. And so then, then they have to capitulate, the Fed has to capitulate again and [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=614.08s)]
*  start another hiking cycle. So I think it's a complicated moment. I think all of the smart [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=618.72s)]
*  money in Wall Street that I talked to up until this point, they forecasted like this period would [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=625.12s)]
*  be choppy. And the second half of the year would be really robust and like you needed to be super [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=630.48s)]
*  long and things were going to be incredible. And when I talked to them this week, they're like, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=635.28s)]
*  Oh, God, we weren't positioned for this, we had no risk going into this, we're going to be forced [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=639.84s)]
*  buyers. There's a bunch of companies that are whispering that they want to go public now. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=643.68s)]
*  Oh, really? Hmm. The big banks have been calling around trying to book build quietly for some [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=649.92s)]
*  IPOs. And so if they try to kind of crack this capital markets open, I think there's again, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=654.7199999999999s)]
*  the marginal risk will be that we do whipsaw. When you say book build, you mean trying to see [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=664.2399999999999s)]
*  if you'll get some early takers to buy equity in an IPO, perhaps even in a company like stripe [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=670.24s)]
*  that's been sitting on the sideline. So not stripe, they're in a complicated moment. But [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=675.52s)]
*  when they called the book build, they basically say, Hey, listen, x, y, z company, quiet filed, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=679.2s)]
*  look at the s one, what do you think? Where's the price, blah, blah, blah. And they're trying [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=685.52s)]
*  to get an indication of whether you'd want to be in the IPO book. So I think that there's a lot [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=689.36s)]
*  of those testing the waters that are now starting again, would there be an appetite in your mind for [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=694.4s)]
*  an IPO in the second quarter of like a stripe type company? But you know, I don't know what the other [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=700.08s)]
*  candidates are the lead candidates, but stripe is when people talk about most the thing that [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=704.96s)]
*  we have to think about is like, most of the market are not people, right? Most of the market are [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=709.2s)]
*  computers and algorithms and ETFs. It's an extremely formulaic buying model. Do you have [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=713.2s)]
*  components of an index, those represent certain percentages, you have to own those percentages [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=719.84s)]
*  to be relevant as that index. And so it's this reinforced buying loop, as well as a reinforced [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=724.32s)]
*  selling loop, right? So when things start moving, those folks have to just systematically move money [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=729.9200000000001s)]
*  in all the humans know that so the humans tend to front run all the computers, and they basically [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=736.72s)]
*  are the ones that sell into these guys. And then that's what inflates these prices. Similarly, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=742.48s)]
*  on the way down, humans try to front run it by being short into that stuff. So we could see [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=747.36s)]
*  the capital markets open, even if we don't, it's actually the worst scenario, because now you have [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=753.4399999999999s)]
*  all this money going into a fewer number of names. That sort of explains Facebook has doubled in, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=759.52s)]
*  in 3060 days. Yeah, I was about to Tesla, Tesla has doubled in 30, you know, 3060 days. A lot of the [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=765.28s)]
*  tech stocks like high beta stocks that we are all, you know, helping to build those companies have [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=771.92s)]
*  just absolutely ripped 60 to 100%. These are not healthy and normal moves. And so the question is, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=777.28s)]
*  what happens if inflation somehow all of a sudden pokes itself back up? Right now, it doesn't look [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=784.8s)]
*  like it is. And Powell was clear. And it's true. We're in a deflationary cycle. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=791.6s)]
*  He said deflation 11 times during his, and he's very clear about his use of language. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=794.0799999999999s)]
*  That's why the market rips. I mean, basically, that was all part of a narrative where [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=799.6s)]
*  inflation is on its way out. We've looked at problem. And that's what the market was pricing in. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=804.16s)]
*  And I think now the question is, in light of today's jobs report, is that actually true or not? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=810.48s)]
*  And I'm sorry, disinflation, not deflation, disinflation. Yeah, disinflation. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=816.4s)]
*  I think, you know, one way to look at this is, Jay, how you showed the chart of the Fed Funds [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=819.76s)]
*  rate. Another chart is the yield curve. Could we just pull up the yield curve for a second? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=824.8000000000001s)]
*  This is the yield on US treasuries, on, you know, RT bills. And one way to look at this is as a [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=829.04s)]
*  prediction market of where the market thinks interest rates are going, because the Fed sets [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=836.48s)]
*  the rate for the Fed's funds rate, which is the overnight rate of lending to banks. But they do [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=842.24s)]
*  not set the rate of, you know, three months, six months, bonds, 10-year bonds, and so on. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=847.1999999999999s)]
*  The market does because the market trades those bonds and it imputes a yield that the market [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=852.88s)]
*  requires to want to hold those bonds. So what's interesting is that if you view the yield curve [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=859.1999999999999s)]
*  again as a prediction market, it tells you at any given time what the collective wisdom is of the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=865.52s)]
*  market. Now, this thing is fluctuating, moving all the time. So that collective wisdom is changing. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=871.92s)]
*  But where things are today, it's pretty interesting. It looks like what the market is saying is that [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=875.92s)]
*  within the next six months, the rate peaks at 4.75%. So Nick, if you just want to hold the mouse on [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=882.48s)]
*  the six-month dot, you'll see it's 4.76%. So basically, the market is predicting we get maybe [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=888.96s)]
*  one more quarter point, roughly, not much. And then if you go to the two-year, it's at 4.09%, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=896.64s)]
*  so a little over 4%. So what the market is actually predicting is that over the next two years, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=905.52s)]
*  we're actually going to get a 50 basis point decrease from the Fed. And then if you go to, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=911.5999999999999s)]
*  say, the five-year or the 10-year, we're at 3.5%. So the market is basically saying that [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=917.12s)]
*  long-term rates are going to stabilize at 3.5%. We're not going back to the abnormal [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=923.04s)]
*  zero-interest rate policy or ZERP that they have for 10 years. 3.5% will be the long-term stable [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=928.56s)]
*  cost of money. But you can see that the market, the prediction market, thinks that the Fed has [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=936.4s)]
*  done enough to combat inflation because the Fed funds right now basically is where the bond market [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=942.24s)]
*  thinks it should be. And in fact, the bond market thinks it's coming down over the next two years. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=949.04s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell But coming down to what would be 3.5%, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=953.52s)]
*  in a world that we've lived in for largely over the 14 years of this bull run, the majority of [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=957.92s)]
*  that was at close to zero or zero. Ben Grahame Right. And that's why we're never going back [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=963.68s)]
*  to the bubble of 2021 where SaaS companies are trading at 100 times ARR. We're going to go back [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=967.1999999999999s)]
*  to an environment more like a more normal one where valuations are more like the 2017 valuation, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=972.8s)]
*  something like that. By the way, 3.5% is not a bad- Aaron Ross Powell It's still a great deal. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=978.64s)]
*  Ben Grahame Still a great deal if you got your mortgage at that. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=983.28s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell If you listen to Buffett, Buffett's teacher, this guy Ben Graham, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=985.12s)]
*  in Ben Graham's book, the way that he would look at a stock, and obviously look, things have changed, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=988.9599999999999s)]
*  but the way that he would look at a stock is he would look at that risk-free rate, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=993.2s)]
*  he would double it. And then the inverse of that is the maximum price to earnings ratio that he [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=997.2800000000001s)]
*  would pay for a stock, right? That's the trade-off is if you can get more than two times the risk-free [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1003.2s)]
*  rate, then it's worth owning a company. What that means is that if you take 3.5% as a terminal rate, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1007.84s)]
*  the right PE is around 14 for the S&P 500. Right now, the S&P 500 trades at 22 times PE, [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1015.9200000000001s)]
*  which would mean that we are 50% overvalued. Now that, again, that's a Benjamin Graham model, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1021.92s)]
*  and I think the world has pretty cleanly moved away from it. But there's probably some rooting [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1026.48s)]
*  in that intellectual framework that's still valuable. And to your point, David, it just [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1032.56s)]
*  reinforces that, man, we need to start to learn a new regime here, because when rates are not zero, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1037.36s)]
*  there's just a lot of excess that you can't support, because the alternative trade-offs [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1043.84s)]
*  for investors are plentiful, you know, and plowing money into a money-losing startup becomes less [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1048.72s)]
*  attractive. And to just give people some background, that's the Intelligent Investor was that book, [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1055.28s)]
*  I believe, and he was talking about value investing, which is, hey, what's the earning per share? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1059.68s)]
*  What's the ratio? What's the PE? And that's something that growth and momentum investing [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1064.32s)]
*  has been the opposite of. And this is a, could be, I think you wrote a blog post about this, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1069.92s)]
*  Jamath. Sort of the regime change. If you look at the Googles, the Facebooks, the Apples, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1074.32s)]
*  Amazon's is a little bit of an exception here. Those companies printed money, they had profits, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1079.84s)]
*  they built up large cash reserves. We look at the next cohort of companies, Airbnbs, coinbases, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1085.84s)]
*  Ubers, et cetera. They focused on the top line growth, much like the Amazon, which was a very [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1091.6799999999998s)]
*  obscure approach, correct, Jamath, in the history of this? Nick, do you want to just throw up this [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1098.56s)]
*  chart? We did a little analysis over here, and it was just basically looking back 60 years of [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1103.52s)]
*  company formation. We looked at all of the hundred most valuable public company startups, and we [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1108.96s)]
*  index that to the 10 year interest rate. So what are we looking at here, Jamath, with this chart? [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1115.36s)]
*  Basically, we went back from 1960 onwards. So basically, you know, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1119.6s)]
*  63 years. And what this shows you is the hundred most valuable public technology companies, then [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1125.2s)]
*  the size of the circle here is their market cap. And then it's overlaid on top of the 10 year [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1134.64s)]
*  interest rate, as well as gray bars for recessions. So what is this graphic meant to illustrate? Well, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1141.5200000000002s)]
*  it just was for us to study, is there a correlation between the value of companies [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1149.52s)]
*  and what the interest rates were, what the economy was doing at the time? And to your point, Jason, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1157.04s)]
*  the trend is pretty starkly made on this chart, which is that if you are a company that was [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1162.64s)]
*  founded in a period of austerity, you had the ability in general to build a much larger company, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1168.96s)]
*  than that which was founded in a period of wealth and excess. Right? So when you look at when rates [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1176.72s)]
*  were sort of approaching zero or were zero, there was a lot of really successful companies, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1183.04s)]
*  they're listed here in the in the light gray on the right. But none of those things really represent [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1188.3999999999999s)]
*  the success that these other companies had. That's the first interesting takeaway. The second [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1192.8799999999999s)]
*  interesting takeaway, though, from this has nothing to do with rates per se. But it is that when rates [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1197.52s)]
*  intersect with the emergence of huge technology trends. So in the case of the 1970s, it was the [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1203.28s)]
*  PC revolution. In the case of the late 1990s, it was the internet revolution. Those two things, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1210.16s)]
*  which required enormous progress in both physical infrastructures, so atoms, as well as software [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1216.8s)]
*  infrastructure bits, when you put those two things together, those also created big companies. And so [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1224.24s)]
*  if you add that all up, the point is that whenever you see huge tectonic shifts in technology, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1229.84s)]
*  combined with periods of austerity, that's when the gargantuan dollars are made. So in the 1970s, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1235.36s)]
*  companies like Microsoft and Apple from the get go had to be profitable. Right? And in the absence [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1242.56s)]
*  of one very important round of financing that Amazon was able to close, the next big wad of [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1248.48s)]
*  companies were founded again in rising rates where they just had to get to the top of the list. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1254.56s)]
*  Rising rates where they just had to get profitable or find a way to be positive free cash flow, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1258.48s)]
*  or have positive working capital faster than anybody else. So these are like really interesting [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1262.32s)]
*  trends that I think just say that as rates creep back up, and if we can intersect that with some [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1268.56s)]
*  improvements in technology over the next five to 10 years that we've all talked about, it could be [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1275.2s)]
*  a real boon for startups and startup investing. It would mean people are a little more resilient, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1279.6s)]
*  a little more hardcore to use a term. Freeberg, what are your thoughts on this analysis by [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1284.72s)]
*  social capital? It's interesting. I mean, I think there's probably two ways you could interpret [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1288.88s)]
*  this. One is in an era of excess capital, all the capital gets competed away. And so you pay more [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1294.32s)]
*  salaries, you have, it's harder to get high quality talent, you make a lower margin, etc, etc. It's [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1301.84s)]
*  much more kind of competitive on the ground. And then another one is just obviously kind of like [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1308.64s)]
*  evolutionary fitness. When there's less capital, investors are more selective. I think what might [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1313.6s)]
*  make this era a little bit different than the past is just the amount of termed dry powder sitting [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1319.84s)]
*  on the sidelines right now. So the total VC capital raised last year, I think was a record high. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1326.8799999999999s)]
*  That means there's a lot more cash that needs to kind of be deployed in the next 12 to 36 months [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1334.56s)]
*  than has ever been deployed in the history of venture. If that holds true. So that may be kind [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1339.2s)]
*  of a counterbalancing effect here where it may take three years before that effect plays out, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1346.88s)]
*  where there's more of a dearth of capital. It's certainly the case that institutional investors, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1352.3200000000002s)]
*  endowments, pension funds, traditional family office, LPs and venture funds are [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1357.1200000000001s)]
*  making far fewer commitments this year to new funds, as I think we all know. And that tightening [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1361.92s)]
*  will play out in the venture funds that will get raised for this vintage, the next vintage and so [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1370.0800000000002s)]
*  on. And so maybe that that kind of evolutionary fitness concept starts to play out later. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1374.48s)]
*  And sizing, and sizing, and sizing. I think there's also this like, you know, we talked about [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1378.96s)]
*  this on our text screen, but the venture business of the last 15 years, everyone since 2008, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1383.92s)]
*  everyone's been trained. And all the younger people that have come up and are now partners [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1392.88s)]
*  and running the firms on an environment of momentum investing, rather than fundamental [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1397.76s)]
*  investing. And so there is also a question of how fit the investors are for a market space, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1403.52s)]
*  where valuations are flat, or descending, or the decision whether or not to invest is no longer [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1412.0s)]
*  driven by who else is investing and how much is the company growing and how much is their valuation [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1418.3200000000002s)]
*  going up. But it's much more about kind of the fundamental performance of the business. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1423.04s)]
*  Aaron Norris Does this match what you're seeing on the ground, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1428.72s)]
*  Sachs? Are people being more dogmatic, pragmatic? Are the capital allocators really [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1430.64s)]
*  sharpening the knives and looking at these businesses a different way? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1439.52s)]
*  Has it actually hit the streets? Sachs Yes, there's a record amount of money [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1442.6399999999999s)]
*  venture capital has raised over the last, you know, couple of years. But it's going to be deployed [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1446.48s)]
*  much more slowly and carefully over the next, say, three or four years than it was over the previous [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1451.28s)]
*  few years. So divide that amount of money by three or four, because the pace of deployment is going [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1456.72s)]
*  to go way down. And so yeah, I think people are going to be more careful and going to take longer [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1464.0s)]
*  to make decisions. I think it's going to be much, much harder for new funds to get started. All of [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1468.24s)]
*  the hype around, you know, solo capitalists and, you know, all these seed funds and micro VCs and [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1473.68s)]
*  all this kind of stuff. I think a lot of that's going to get washed away. I think in hindsight, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1481.68s)]
*  a lot of that was a product of the bubble. And yeah, I think you're going to be in for [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1486.16s)]
*  a period of some retrenchment in VC. And I think that's good. I mean, I think to the point of Chimass [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1490.96s)]
*  study that, you know, that the counterintuitive finding in his study was that great companies [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1496.96s)]
*  are created during times when we're not in a bubble and capital is sloshing around everywhere, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1505.2s)]
*  but when you're in an environment of moderate capital availability. And I think the point is [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1511.3600000000001s)]
*  that we all have to be under some stress, right? That's what evolution requires is, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1517.68s)]
*  you know, if an ecosystem or an organism is not under stress, they have no pressure to evolve [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1523.28s)]
*  and become fitter and compete. And I think that's what makes our industry and our ecosystem [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1530.0s)]
*  very adaptive over time is that it's constantly, you know, it does face survival pressures, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1536.56s)]
*  but over the last several years, all the survival pressures were taken away because anybody could [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1542.72s)]
*  raise money. And there was always another bridge available. There was always some [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1547.44s)]
*  extension and there was no some convertible to be done. There was no reckoning. You know, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1552.0s)]
*  a lot of these companies just seem to, you know, get another 12 months of runway, another 12 months [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1556.96s)]
*  of runners learned so many bad habits during that period of time and so much entitlement and [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1561.44s)]
*  excess built up in the system during that time. And I think now we're, we're seeing that a lot [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1567.6s)]
*  of that is working its way out. I mean, just look at the Facebook results the other day. So Facebook, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1574.32s)]
*  Facebook is an example because here you have a company where the stock over the past year [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1579.92s)]
*  had been pounded. It was like down over 50%. And the market did not like its answers around [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1585.68s)]
*  the capital investments it was making. And then Brad Gerstner, our friend, wrote that letter [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1593.2s)]
*  encouraging them to get much more efficient. And then they did that. And they basically started [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1597.6000000000001s)]
*  doing some rifts and basically just getting much more efficient in what they're doing and [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1603.68s)]
*  specifically taking out layers and layers of middle management. I mean, that was really the [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1607.68s)]
*  big thing. So they kind of took a page out of Elon's book in terms of what Elon had done at [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1612.24s)]
*  Twitter. I mean, not nearly to that extent because I don't think they needed to, but they targeted [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1616.8s)]
*  this idea of we have too many layers in the company, too many mid-level managers and the [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1621.68s)]
*  stock ripped just, what was it, like up 20, 25% yesterday? Yeah, in a day. And they're up to, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1626.5600000000002s)]
*  I actually bought it based, the day they had the layoffs, I put in a buy order and it was closed [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1632.72s)]
*  at $94 and now it's at 193. And FedEx, of all places, is laying off 10% of its offers, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1639.44s)]
*  officers and directors. So the idea now is, hey, in the senior ranks, what is the inefficiency there? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1648.0s)]
*  How do we get more doers, more people who actually are building or operating the companies [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1654.8000000000002s)]
*  to take the reins and get rid of this, as you're saying, middle management, this waste that [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1662.0s)]
*  companies have? Let me tell you specifically the problem that builds up in these companies [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1667.6000000000001s)]
*  is that everybody wants to be a manager. And so you can't just come at this problem by saying, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1671.76s)]
*  we're going to increase the number of reports that each manager has from five to 10. That [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1677.2s)]
*  doesn't work because let me tell you what happens is that every individual contributor who's a star [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1681.3600000000001s)]
*  thinks that their career advancement requires them to manage a team. So what happens is you [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1687.2s)]
*  take that star IC and then you create a team around them. So that person then hires five [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1691.6s)]
*  people to manage and those five people are not a star. Yeah, they stop working. They just start [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1697.04s)]
*  managing. Well, maybe you get like 20% more production out of that six person unit than [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1702.24s)]
*  you would have just out of the star, but you're spending five times more money. So it makes no [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1707.9199999999998s)]
*  sense. And the problem is it cascades. So that IC becomes a manager. They hire five people. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1712.9599999999998s)]
*  Then those five people, one of them's a star and says, well, I want to be a manager on all [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1719.28s)]
*  the organizational pressures to keep building more and more teams and more and more layers. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1723.44s)]
*  Here's the quote from Mark Zuckerberg to illustrate your point from a recent all hands [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1728.32s)]
*  meeting. I don't think you want a management structure. That's just managers, managing [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1733.04s)]
*  managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1736.8s)]
*  Yes. It's the problem of infinite delegation. Every like star builds a team around them to [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1741.6s)]
*  delegate the work, but then they hire a team to delegate the work to. And pretty soon the most [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1746.08s)]
*  junior interns in the company are doing all the work and all the best people are just managing. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1750.72s)]
*  So it's actually a huge problem. And I think that I'd say that a lot of CEOs don't quite [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1755.1999999999998s)]
*  understand the problem because they think that all they have to do is increase the number of [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1760.72s)]
*  reports that managers have. It's not, you also have to reduce the number of layers in the company. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1765.04s)]
*  And just the ultimate example of this, just to put a point on it was at Twitter, what we saw [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1770.96s)]
*  is that when Elon went in to basically do a riff at Twitter, the first question he asked [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1775.92s)]
*  in the engineering department is who's checked in code. And they looked at the code repository [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1783.2s)]
*  and over 50% of the engineering department had not checked in code in months. And you want to know [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1788.48s)]
*  the reason for that is because the engineers were told that if you want to be a manager in this [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1793.52s)]
*  company, you don't code. Managers don't code, only ICs code. And no one wants to be an IC, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1798.96s)]
*  no one ambitious wants to be an IC, they all want to get promoted. So it all gets- [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1804.64s)]
*  Explain what an IC is? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1808.8000000000002s)]
*  Just individual contributor. So the whole thing turned upside down because of this idea [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1810.0800000000002s)]
*  that again, ambitious people want to be managers and managers don't do the real work. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1815.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's a cowboy who don't know how to ride horses. It's like, it's a dangerous precedent to [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1819.3600000000001s)]
*  set. What are your takeaways Chamath from what happened at Facebook when you look at it and the [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1824.0s)]
*  pressure that was put on the ripping of the stock, even though they're down 2% year over year [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1831.04s)]
*  in terms of advertising revenue. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1836.56s)]
*  There's a guy on my team sent me this chart, he did a pretty detailed technical analysis of Facebook. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1837.84s)]
*  Nick, can you please put that image up there? So basically, this shows- [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1845.2s)]
*  This is really technical. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1849.6s)]
*  This is the first time Facebook mentioned the word metaverse in Q2 of 21. On the earnings call, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1851.36s)]
*  they mentioned it 20 times. And the gray line here is the stock price. So as they kept mentioning [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1858.8s)]
*  it, the stock price just reacted as it did. But Q4 of 22 was the first time that the word efficiency [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1864.32s)]
*  exceeded the word metaverse and you saw the stock price rip up. So what's happened at Facebook is [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1871.84s)]
*  really interesting because I think it transitioned to what's generally called an X growth company, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1878.08s)]
*  which means that people are now looking at a business that has essentially gotten to [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1883.44s)]
*  its peak size. And now what they're looking at is its ability to generate cash flow. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1889.1200000000001s)]
*  The cash flow generation or cash flow yield of the business was like three and a half percent. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1894.8s)]
*  But they're making enormous cuts, both in capex, as well as headcount over time, they're getting [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1900.56s)]
*  their expenses under control. And all of that should drive up their cash, free cash flow yield. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1908.0800000000002s)]
*  And so I think why people got very excited is there are very few X growth stocks that you can [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1914.0s)]
*  own that can just compound and crunch ginormous amounts of money. And these guys are in an [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1919.68s)]
*  incredible position to do it, you know, more than 100 plus billion dollars of revenue. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1926.0800000000002s)]
*  And if you get these costs under control and get efficient, get the employee base down to 30 or 40 [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1930.24s)]
*  thousand over time. This is a thing that just spits out just ginormous amounts of cash. And so [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1936.72s)]
*  it's really a value investing and Warren Buffett, that means the earnings per share go way up. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1943.28s)]
*  Yeah, you know, like, like the Facebook P is quite modest, actually. Now I actually [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1947.68s)]
*  put back in stock based comp, and its P is about 11. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1952.72s)]
*  So still reasonable. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1956.1599999999999s)]
*  If you go back to the to the Ben Graham analysis, this is a company that perfectly meets that [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1957.28s)]
*  criteria of like, you can buy it at a P that's basically two times the risk free rate. And so [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1962.72s)]
*  I think it's an incredible stock now that you can own. Because if they keep grinding out all [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1969.68s)]
*  of these kind of free cash flow gains, man, they'll just they'll just have enormous amounts of money. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1975.2s)]
*  They already announced a $40 billion buyback. You know, the thing to keep in mind is, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1979.6000000000001s)]
*  Apple had a moment like this. And when Apple went X growth, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1984.16s)]
*  they did the brilliant thing, which is they said we're going to borrow heavily. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1989.2s)]
*  And we're going to return cash. I may have posted this in the group chat to you guys. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1993.3600000000001s)]
*  By 2025, Apple will have exceeded $1 trillion of cash distributions. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=1997.2s)]
*  I mean, that is just nuts. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2004.64s)]
*  Is that include buybacks in cash distributions? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2007.44s)]
*  Buybacks in dividends. And so Facebook now you can credibly see a path where Facebook could chunk out [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2010.24s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars of total shareholder value returned over the next four [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2017.3600000000001s)]
*  or five years. And so, you know, for value investors, it's somewhat of a kind of a [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2022.56s)]
*  no brainer. I mean, nothing's a no brainer, but yeah, really, really attractive value [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2027.04s)]
*  fundamentals right now. I mean, you did see Warren Buffett buying Apple, I think it's his [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2031.76s)]
*  largest position, you're going to see him probably do the same with Facebook. There was an interesting [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2035.68s)]
*  mass extinction event tweet that went on that's related to all of this, Tom Leverio, a GP general [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2039.92s)]
*  partner at IVP, which is a venture firm, tweeted the following thread, there is a mass extinction [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2045.28s)]
*  event coming for early and mid stage companies, late 23 and 24. But make the 2008 financial crisis [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2049.28s)]
*  look quaint for startups below I explain when, how and why. And we'll start off with some detailed [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2056.2400000000002s)]
*  advice. Basically, four and five, four in five early stage startups, he claims have less than [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2062.8s)]
*  12 months of runway, according to a Q4 survey of 450 founders by January ventures. He sees [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2067.6800000000003s)]
*  late 2324 when this will all come home to roost Mark Seuster from upfront ventures, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2075.6s)]
*  friend of the pod, reply with the following precisely our internal analysis 5000 seed, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2082.08s)]
*  2.5 million raised or above a and b companies, those are three different categories funded in [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2088.0s)]
*  the last four years, we estimate 50% will go out of business. Loss ratios in the last seven years [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2093.68s)]
*  have been artificially low due to excess capital, as we just discussed previously with the never [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2098.2400000000002s)]
*  ending bridge, we've talked about this before, if you look back over 40 years of venture capital, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2104.48s)]
*  the average top quartile fund distributes 1.6 or 1.7 x the capital they raise. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2109.2s)]
*  Even though now we've gone through a period where people have shown these unbelievable markups, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2116.0s)]
*  right, TVP eyes, the total value of paid in capital distributions have not really budged [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2120.88s)]
*  that much distributions are still modest, they're below two x. And so we have to go through what's [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2127.28s)]
*  called mean reversion, right, we have to go back to the historic statistical average, which means [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2132.48s)]
*  that a 50 to 60% mortality rate seems pretty reasonable. By the way, in the dot com bubble, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2138.0s)]
*  that's what we went through, you know, in 2001 to 2005, we had a 50% mortality rate at the seed [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2144.8s)]
*  stage. I mean, you kind of expect 70% to go out to series A, maybe a little bit less free for what [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2149.52s)]
*  are you seeing on the streets? You're investing in startups? Yeah, look, I think that there's [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2153.76s)]
*  Is there an opportunity, by the way, also in here? So what are you seeing? But is there an [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2158.64s)]
*  opportunity in this group of this cohort of companies, which seem to be upside down and or [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2161.68s)]
*  in a tsunami right now? This cohort of companies, I think, generally, is overburdened [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2168.08s)]
*  with feature orientation and short termism, more than you would see in an era of reduced capital [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2176.0s)]
*  rather than excess capital. And what I mean by that is a lot of companies built a business or [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2185.52s)]
*  built a product that allowed them to show traction in the market faster. And typically, those products [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2190.56s)]
*  that are easier kind of paths to market, end up being features, they don't end up being platforms. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2197.28s)]
*  So it's very hard to become a big business or to become a scaling business, or to differentiate in [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2202.08s)]
*  a competitive market. That's a general, that's a very general statement. But I think, you know, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2206.56s)]
*  when you miss out on the platform play, you start betting as an investor on a lot of the derivative [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2211.04s)]
*  plays that look like the real big company look like the platform. I mean, think about how many [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2217.2s)]
*  companies try to look like some iteration of stripe, or try to look like some iteration of Uber, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2221.36s)]
*  or try to look like some iteration of, you know, name your big kind of behemoth. And as a result, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2226.88s)]
*  you get all these sort of feature ish platform plays that have maybe a niche, or some kind of, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2231.84s)]
*  you know, narrow kind of market opportunity, they got funded, those those businesses, obviously, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2238.48s)]
*  aren't going to have the same valuation multiples of the winners in the market. And now, and they [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2243.6s)]
*  burnt a lot of money to demonstrate growth, because so much of investing over the last 15 years has [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2248.4s)]
*  been momentum investing. And so they try to grow, then they try to get a higher valuation investors [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2252.08s)]
*  apply more money in. Now the problem is that so many of these series BCD and E companies have a [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2257.12s)]
*  true market value, they're not a valueless company, but the true market value of them is probably [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2262.72s)]
*  less than the total preference stack of the capital that's gotten. So they're worth less. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2268.24s)]
*  Let me just make sure people understand. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2272.56s)]
*  I'll just describe it. Yeah. So when investors invest, they have preferred stock, so they have [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2275.04s)]
*  a right to get their money back. So they let's say a one X liquidation preference, they invest 100 [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2279.68s)]
*  million dollars, the company is worth 300. They own 25% of the company after they invest. But they [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2284.24s)]
*  have a right to that hundred million dollars first, before common shareholders get paid. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2290.16s)]
*  The problem now is that a lot of those companies may be worth less than the 100. They're not worth [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2294.96s)]
*  400 anymore, they're worth 100. And you can see this play out in the public markets with that [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2298.96s)]
*  that data set I shared with you guys a few weeks ago, over two thirds of companies now that have [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2303.76s)]
*  gone public since 2020 are worth less than the capital that they have raised as in the venture [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2308.56s)]
*  market. So if they were still private, they would be worth less than their preference stack. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2314.1600000000003s)]
*  And that's where these companies start to unravel. Because now the investors have to [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2319.28s)]
*  totally recap the company, the founders don't want to have all of their common wiped out. Now [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2323.2s)]
*  they own nothing. And there ends up being a very ugly scenario that happens with the board at that [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2327.3599999999997s)]
*  point, on how do we wind this thing down? How do we recap it? What's going to happen? And that's [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2331.9199999999996s)]
*  usually where everyone starts to run for the hills, the founders one or more of the founders leave [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2336.48s)]
*  and so on. I have a question for you. So you mentioned this earlier, which I think was a [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2340.3999999999996s)]
*  really important point, but we didn't really touch it. Do you think there's going to be [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2343.9199999999996s)]
*  a reckoning inside of venture firms about recalibrating general partners? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2347.92s)]
*  100% I mean, look, and why sorry, just explain why. Yeah, so I think what's happened is over [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2353.92s)]
*  the last 15 years to become a successful venture investor, you've gotten into the hot deals, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2358.96s)]
*  the deals were and hot deals, the valuations are typically climbing up. And, you know, when the [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2364.48s)]
*  valuations climb up, that's an indicator that the company is doing well, and you should invest. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2369.2000000000003s)]
*  That's been the model for operating in the last 15 years. But the truth is that maybe just because [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2374.16s)]
*  the valuations have gone up and more money has gone in, doesn't necessarily mean that that's a [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2379.44s)]
*  great business or as Jamal points out, that you ultimately get a positive net return on that [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2383.2s)]
*  investment down the road. And that window is now closed. So the investors that have been trained, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2387.8399999999997s)]
*  this is such a generalization, and I hate saying it because we have so many good smart friends that [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2394.24s)]
*  work in venture. But generally speaking, there are a lot of folks who have come up, who have been [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2398.3199999999997s)]
*  trained on this momentum investing model. And it's like, it's like day trading, the stocks are [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2402.8s)]
*  going up, let's all put money into the stock going up, instead of having a more fundamental approach [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2407.1200000000003s)]
*  to is there real cash generation potential and scalability and platform ability of this company. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2411.52s)]
*  And as a result, you're going to have to see I think the junior partners that have come up [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2417.36s)]
*  and done well in this market. Can I go on your point? Well, they've they've done well on paper, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2421.1200000000003s)]
*  but they haven't done well on distribution. So maybe that Shamath becomes the well, so you decide [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2427.36s)]
*  who's a good venture capitalist, which of these companies actually returned capital at a peak [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2432.0s)]
*  market? Well, I think Freeberg is really onto something. And he mentioned this before. So [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2436.08s)]
*  I got curious about this. And I went into pitch book. And my team and I looked at all of the people, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2441.04s)]
*  the humans in our business, that have generated more than $1 billion in distributions on a given [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2448.4s)]
*  deal. And there's 20 that have done that in our industry. Like, there's people that have made [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2454.32s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars once or twice. But there's 20 people that have made more than a [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2459.28s)]
*  billion dollars more than once. Okay. And if you look, not a single one came up through the ranks [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2462.96s)]
*  as a pure engineer or product manager, right, everybody 201 is extremely commercial in their [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2467.0400000000004s)]
*  background and their operating experience. Very few percentages of them were actually founders, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2474.2400000000002s)]
*  a huge percentage of them were trained in banks and other places. So non traditional, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2481.36s)]
*  quote unquote roles for what this current crop of GPS look like, because we went through a phase [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2486.48s)]
*  where if you were a VP of product or a VP of design or a VP of engineering at a well known [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2491.6s)]
*  startup, that was the most obvious onboarding into a venture firm. But if you just look back [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2497.04s)]
*  at the data, that cohort of people has actually never made money again, according to pitch book. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2502.56s)]
*  That's fascinating. And that's a really fascinating counterintuitive takeaway, which is that, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2507.84s)]
*  and by the way, what's so interesting about that is Pat Grady, I think had a tweet, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2512.7999999999997s)]
*  and it just sums it up so cleanly because he just hired somebody from CO2. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2517.2799999999997s)]
*  And the tweet was something to the effect of this guy is the most commercial guy we've ever seen, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2521.8399999999997s)]
*  something like that. And I thought that was so interesting, because that is exactly what our [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2527.8399999999997s)]
*  heuristical analysis of this data was as well. Commercial people in venture are the ones that [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2532.24s)]
*  make the money. So you look at a Fred Wilson, Michael Moritz, Danny, Bill Gurley, Bill Gurley, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2537.12s)]
*  they were investment analysts, I can share your list markets before they became venture investors, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2542.88s)]
*  or Mike Moritz, who was a who was a journalist, which is a journalist is just an analyst. It's [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2547.44s)]
*  another if you're a good journalist, it's another word for analyst. Yeah, it was really, really [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2552.56s)]
*  interesting looking at that list. So like, you know, there are people in there like Jim Getz, [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2556.0s)]
*  Alfred Lin, Danny Reimer, Jan Hammer, Fenton. So if you look at all of these folks that are just [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2560.4s)]
*  tier one people, and we know all of them, the one common thread amongst all those folks is that [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2568.56s)]
*  unbelievably commercial. And so Jason, in a moment like this, where you have to really hold the [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2574.0s)]
*  entrepreneurs feet to the fire, or be their partner to make extremely hard decisions, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2580.24s)]
*  you have to have the ability to be respected by them in those moments where you can force a [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2585.04s)]
*  very difficult decision. And then separately, if you have to basically force liquidity, so that [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2589.6800000000003s)]
*  you prioritize your limited partners, how do you do that while still managing the relationship with [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2595.04s)]
*  the entrepreneur? How do you know that you just need to cut your losses and get out? These are [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2599.1200000000003s)]
*  very difficult trade offs that I think folks haven't been trained in doing to David's point. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2602.96s)]
*  So it'll be really interesting few years to see how these organizations. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2608.48s)]
*  I think this goes to Sachs's point about, hey, the ecosystem, if it's hard, if it's cantankerous, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2612.08s)]
*  if there's sand in the oyster, it could make the pearl. If you have a congenial relationship with [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2618.7999999999997s)]
*  your product manager VC and everybody's champagne and caviar and high-fiving, maybe that's not as [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2626.08s)]
*  good as having a Bill Gurley, a Michael Moritz, and having a foil maybe who is putting pressure [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2633.7599999999998s)]
*  on the management team. Hey, we need to hit these numbers. Freberg and then Sachs. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2639.12s)]
*  Yeah. Look, I think one counter argument here may be that there is this friggin title wave [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2642.64s)]
*  of AI companies and there is this incredible amount of lubricant in the dry powder that's [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2650.08s)]
*  sitting on the side of the market right now that all these venture funds raised in the last two [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2655.6s)]
*  years that is going to lubricate all these AI companies into every vertical and every market. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2660.4s)]
*  Every company is wrapped up in an AI cloak, like a magic invisibility cloak. Every AI company has [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2665.8399999999997s)]
*  got an AI hat and a badge and a tattoo now, or every company is being rewritten as an AI company. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2671.2799999999997s)]
*  The money wants to find its way into AI and it wants to rewrite every industry with AI. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2676.72s)]
*  I think similar to what we saw with mobile and the social web going back 10 or 15 years, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2682.56s)]
*  we're seeing kind of this AI wrapper and this AI technology enabler rewrite the possibility of [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2688.64s)]
*  every vertical and the VCs have capital, more capital than they had 15 years ago or 10 years [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2695.2799999999997s)]
*  ago or even seven years ago. So there is this counter narrative, which may be that [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2700.0s)]
*  the game goes on, the band continues to march on, the current crop dies out, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2705.7599999999998s)]
*  but there's immediately a new crop waiting right behind it. Or what happens is the herd dies and [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2710.0s)]
*  everyone runs to the back of the herd and gets recapitalized. Because I can tell you every startup [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2714.88s)]
*  I know that's not going well, everyone's talking about leaving to go do an AI company and the [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2719.36s)]
*  venture firms are ready to write money. I think you're right about that. I think the question is [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2723.2000000000003s)]
*  the actual person making the check, will they be more or less likely? And at least what history [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2727.84s)]
*  would tell you is that we've hired an entire generation of people that, and this is clear, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2735.12s)]
*  do not map to the people in our industry that have actually generated returns. So you're right, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2742.88s)]
*  they may take this money and misallocate it into these companies that are just rebranding themselves, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2748.8s)]
*  but that just goes and further proves that there is a type of person that hasn't been recruited [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2753.52s)]
*  into these venture firms yet that was the first generation that made all the money. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2759.76s)]
*  I think it's always been the case that there is some difference between the background of the VCs [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2763.6800000000003s)]
*  and the backgrounds of the founders. I mean, you guys mentioned Gurley and Maritz. Like we said, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2769.44s)]
*  Maritz was a journalist who had written a book about Apple. He wasn't technical per se. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2774.88s)]
*  And Gurley was an investment analyst on Wall Street before he then made the transition [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2781.52s)]
*  into VC. As we both know, they're like legendary VCs. I think that what you want to see in a VC, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2787.36s)]
*  I think the background matters a little bit less than how curious are they, how good are they about [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2796.96s)]
*  learning a new area, how good are they at being a heat-seeking missile? I mean, basically just [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2804.16s)]
*  zeroing in on what is the hot space and specifically what is the best company within that space and [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2808.88s)]
*  somehow figuring that out. Being able to assess a founder, that's a very subjective thing. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2816.7200000000003s)]
*  I think there's lots of qualifications that you want to see in a VC. Now, at the same time, [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2822.48s)]
*  I do think that if AI is the next wave and the next platform opportunity as we all think it is, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2827.68s)]
*  I do think that places more of an emphasis on technical skills. I was literally just having [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2836.16s)]
*  this conversation at Kraft that, gee, maybe the next hire we should make at Kraft should be someone [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2841.9199999999996s)]
*  who's really deep technically so they can help go deeper on technical due diligence of AI companies. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2846.48s)]
*  They've never made money. What's that? They've never made money in the history of our business. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2854.32s)]
*  Who? Those people. That archetype of hire has never done that on behalf of LPs or GPs. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2859.04s)]
*  In biotech and life sciences, they have. The best investors usually PhDs there. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2864.96s)]
*  He's saying a technical hire who worked in the trenches at a company is not as fit to get- [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2869.52s)]
*  No, has not in the past. Has not in the past. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2874.16s)]
*  ... gotten DPI, whereas somebody who is more commercial- [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2876.56s)]
*  Able to analyze a business commercial- [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2879.92s)]
*  The ideal person- [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2882.16s)]
*  ... is going to be able to get returns. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2883.04s)]
*  So look, I think the ideal person would be someone who's just fundamentally a great investor but also [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2885.68s)]
*  has some technical background and some technical chops. We also have a team approach at Kraft. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2890.0s)]
*  If you have someone who's very technical, they can just diligence the technical aspects of the deal. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2895.2799999999997s)]
*  Somebody else can be responsible for making an assessment of the founders. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2899.3599999999997s)]
*  How we've solved this is we have a group of third-party individuals that we work with, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2903.44s)]
*  that we keep on retainer, that we compensate. Whenever we need to do deep technical diligence, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2908.32s)]
*  we partner with them to do that work with us. What it allows us to do is get the best of their [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2914.32s)]
*  technical thinking without also putting them in a position of trying to adjudicate whether this [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2919.76s)]
*  company is good or not. What I'm trying to understand is what is this technical edge and [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2924.56s)]
*  can I understand the boundaries of that? But I still keep the investment decision to myself [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2929.6s)]
*  and my partners because otherwise the difficulty is, in my experience, deeply, deeply technical [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2935.36s)]
*  people are extremely good at diligence but generally are poor at making investment decisions [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2941.7599999999998s)]
*  because there's a part of their brain that flips on which is like, I could do it better or I could [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2946.88s)]
*  do it this way or I could do it that way. I think that anchoring bias can be very dangerous. You [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2951.44s)]
*  almost want to be a little dumbed down from that depth of knowledge because you either find [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2958.8s)]
*  everything that is not worth doing and then you can miss a market or you miss the thing that is [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2964.48s)]
*  good enough because you're like, oh, well, I would have done X, Y, and Z in a different way. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2970.7200000000003s)]
*  We use them but we keep them at arm's length so that they never feel the pressure of having to [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2974.88s)]
*  actually decide on our behalf how the money should be spent. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2979.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. That's interesting. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2982.4s)]
*  Yeah. The number one thing we're doing at this early stage is training our founders. I know this [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2983.28s)]
*  sounds crazy, on accounting best practices and pricing best practices. We literally have founders [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2987.04s)]
*  who have never made a plan. I'm talking about at the seed stage who don't know accounting. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2993.7599999999998s)]
*  We are running four seed stage startups and I'm kicking myself that we didn't do it two years ago [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=2998.72s)]
*  or three years ago but better late than never on how to just maintain their books and understand [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3003.68s)]
*  operations and the operational lack of discipline in the market. I'm seeing Series A and Series B [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3010.48s)]
*  companies that literally don't understand their own accounting. When we start talking to their [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3017.04s)]
*  accountants, there is a huge gap between what the accountants think of this business and what the [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3022.1600000000003s)]
*  founders think of these businesses. Founders think they have more revenue than they have or less [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3026.32s)]
*  revenue. They really don't even know how to calculate their runway in an honest way. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3031.36s)]
*  Back to your point, Chamath, about on the venture side of the business, a lot of product focus, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3037.12s)]
*  a lot of operational focus. There's not enough focus on just the bottom line. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3042.2400000000002s)]
*  The reason that happened is what Friedberg said before, which is like somebody would build [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3046.08s)]
*  something, there was a little bit of momentum and you'd have to go and present these bona fides to [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3050.72s)]
*  these entrepreneurs to get into the deal. What venture firms thought was the right bona fide [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3055.84s)]
*  to present is, oh, I built XYZ product at this other company. They thought that that edge could [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3060.64s)]
*  get you into a deal, maybe, but it could turn out that that was the wrong company to be in in the [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3066.3199999999997s)]
*  first place. And so you just missed an entire generation of value creation because it happened [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3071.44s)]
*  sort of off piste. Off the trail. You really do need to understand fundamentally, because we're [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3077.68s)]
*  talking about public markets here, the Facebook analogy, what is the ultimate earnings? What is [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3083.52s)]
*  the ultimate cash that is going to get thrown off this business? And that's what the whole industry [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3089.6s)]
*  needs to, I think, pivot to and just that needs to be the operating principle. Do you guys know how [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3094.48s)]
*  much money Facebook, Amazon, Google and Microsoft raised combined total before they went public? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3100.24s)]
*  That's very small. I mean, Google is minuscule. Less than a quarter billion dollars. Unbelievable. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3106.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah. All the inefficiency is extraordinary. And then on top of this inefficiency, I don't know [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3110.9599999999996s)]
*  if you're seeing this. They were all profitable when they went public. On top of all this [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3114.9599999999996s)]
*  inefficiency is a dependence on venture debt. I don't know if you're seeing this, Sax, but [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3119.52s)]
*  the amount of focus on adding debt to unprofitable companies over the last five years has been [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3124.6400000000003s)]
*  just extraordinary. I don't understand what- I've never understood the venture debt model [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3131.6800000000003s)]
*  really how it works. I feel like it's a category that doesn't make any sense. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3135.6000000000004s)]
*  Say more. I mean, well, I mean- [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3139.84s)]
*  Explain it to people what's happening. I don't really understand how it makes sense for lenders [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3142.7200000000003s)]
*  or for founders, to be honest. I think the whole industry doesn't make any sense. For founders, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3146.32s)]
*  I don't like it because the money has to be paid back, right? It's debt. So founders take in [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3150.88s)]
*  this venture debt thinking like it's an equity round, but without dilution or with some warrants. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3155.84s)]
*  And they don't realize, well, wait a second, we got to pay this back in a year or a year and a [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3161.76s)]
*  half out of the next round they do. But that creates an overhang on the next round because [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3166.08s)]
*  the new VC's coming in, they want their money to go into the company, not paying off a bank. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3170.56s)]
*  So it actually makes the next round less attractive. The other thing about it is that [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3176.0s)]
*  the lender is not getting an equity reward. So they don't want to take equity risk. They may [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3181.52s)]
*  be getting a nice coupon. They might be getting 9% or something like that, which sounds high for [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3188.08s)]
*  debt, but they're not taking true equity risks in the company. So the last thing they want to do [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3194.48s)]
*  is be your last six months of runway, right? They want to be your first six months of runway [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3198.8s)]
*  and then get paid off on the backend. And I think a lot of founders think, oh, well, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3204.48s)]
*  I'll take this money and it'll extend my runway from 18 months to two years. But what will happen [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3209.76s)]
*  in that last six months is all of a sudden the bank will come to you and say, no, no, no, no, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3215.28s)]
*  like you have this or that material adverse condition. It's called a Mac out. And there's [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3220.32s)]
*  all these like terms that founders don't understand because it's highly legalistic covenants. And so [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3226.56s)]
*  all of a sudden the founders find themselves with a lot less flexibility in that last six months to [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3233.52s)]
*  a year, either a covenant gets triggered that makes them pay back the money immediately or their [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3239.92s)]
*  business flexibility goes way down because they're consulting with their bank about everything. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3245.44s)]
*  All of this is coming home to roost right now. I think it's a terrible deal for founders. And [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3249.7599999999998s)]
*  I think that even for the lenders, I mean, I guess I assume that these banks know their business [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3254.56s)]
*  better than I do. But I think that the reason I don't trust it as a category from a lender [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3260.0s)]
*  point of view or from like an investor point of view is that all the data about defaults [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3269.76s)]
*  over the last five to 10 years happened in this free flowing zero interest rate environment. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3275.28s)]
*  And so the startup mortality rates were artificially low because it's so easy to raise. So [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3281.28s)]
*  yeah, venture debt makes sense in an environment in which founders are generally able to raise the [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3287.6s)]
*  next round and then pay back the venture debt. But let's say that that tweet storm you mentioned, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3292.4s)]
*  Jason, can you bring that back on the screen? I actually think this tweet storm is basically [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3298.08s)]
*  correct is, you know, I've referred to on this show before that I think one of the things that [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3301.84s)]
*  built up during this bubble is latent startup mortality. So many startups that should have died [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3306.56s)]
*  from not being able to raise next round lived because they're able to raise money. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3313.2s)]
*  Walking down. And what this tweet storm is predicting is that the second half [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3317.12s)]
*  of 2023 and then 24, you're going to have a huge crunch where all these companies have to go out [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3320.56s)]
*  and raise. They've been waiting. So they're all going to get to the point where their cash is so [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3326.72s)]
*  low. They have to go out and raise. And now all of a sudden they're going to be confronted with [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3331.6s)]
*  the new market conditions. I wonder how many of them have venture debt as an overhang. And that [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3335.2799999999997s)]
*  one's yeah. And they're going to find they have less runway than they thought because again, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3340.24s)]
*  those banks, you know, they are going to try and collect the debt before the start runs out of [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3345.12s)]
*  money. Not, you know, when it runs out of cash to falling knives. You pay. Exactly. So, so look, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3351.7599999999998s)]
*  I just wonder what would I what I don't trust is whether the return models on venture debt that [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3357.12s)]
*  were created over the last five to 10 years will be a good predictor of what the returns will be [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3363.8399999999997s)]
*  in the next five, 10 years when a lot of the mortality that should have happened in the past [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3369.12s)]
*  now happens in the future. I mean, then in sex, correct me if I'm wrong here, but I'm also starting [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3374.64s)]
*  to see really gnarly term sheets, people foreclosing on businesses, people offering like literally had [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3379.2s)]
*  a term sheet come in, like we're going to forgive the last note and take this business over for a [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3385.6s)]
*  dollar and everybody gets wiped out. The amount of bad feelings that you have to go through, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3390.16s)]
*  even if there is a core business to free books point or, hey, they raised 100 million, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3395.6s)]
*  but there's a $50 million business in here that people would love to invest in. Who wants to go [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3399.8399999999997s)]
*  through the hand wringing, the negotiation, the toxicity of a recap? It's an extremely hard [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3404.7999999999997s)]
*  process to go through. Are you going through any recaps right now, sex? And what is the, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3411.2799999999997s)]
*  not yet. The firm in terms of dealing with these kinds of situations, you even want to [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3415.2799999999997s)]
*  start that discussion up? Or is it too painful? Well, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3420.16s)]
*  we're not a company, not one. I don't think for most of our companies, we're at the recap or [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3424.4s)]
*  restructuring stage. I mean, I'm talking about the ones that aren't going well, people still have [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3428.8s)]
*  a fair amount of cash in the bank. And we've been beating the drums for literally a year. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3432.08s)]
*  Opportunities and new opportunity comes to you. It's one of these overhang companies that wants [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3438.0s)]
*  to restructure. Would you even engage that? Or is it just too hard? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3441.36s)]
*  I looked at seven at the end of last year, and I tried to reprice three of them. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3443.84s)]
*  And every single one was able to get a convert done away from us. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3449.52s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean, yeah, we tried to find a market clearing price for this equity, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3453.7599999999998s)]
*  but nobody wants it to David's point, because there's too much money on the sideline. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3457.7599999999998s)]
*  And people are willing to give them a lifeline that doesn't force them to [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3461.12s)]
*  come to hard terms with what the reality of the moment is. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3466.24s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. We're not quite there yet. And I think the the reason why that that tweet [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3470.0s)]
*  you posted got some traction is it's saying, listen, the crunch is going to happen. Second [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3474.64s)]
*  half of 2023 and 2024. That's where you're going to see the down rounds. That's where you're going [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3480.24s)]
*  to see the restructuring the recaps and all the rest of it. And look, I'm sure like every VC firm [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3484.8799999999997s)]
*  is going to be a player in that. But yeah, it's going to be a lot of miserable work for founders. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3491.6s)]
*  This is when you're going to see people's true colors when when when you have to recap a company. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3497.68s)]
*  And yeah, this is when you can really start to see how crappy it was in 2003 to be here. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3502.16s)]
*  Remember 2003? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3508.16s)]
*  Painful. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3509.68s)]
*  Oh my god. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3510.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, there was lucky to raise 500k on a $3 million. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3513.12s)]
*  Oh my god, like 2004. Like what a brutal year. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3516.72s)]
*  Yeah, there's gonna be a lot of that. I think the next 18 months, or let's say the next two years, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3520.3999999999996s)]
*  there's gonna be pretty rough for a lot of companies. And it's just that they didn't cut [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3525.8399999999997s)]
*  enough. I mean, we've been beating on the drums for a year for companies to lengthen their runway. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3530.96s)]
*  And some did to some extent, but many didn't do enough. And they're going to get caught in [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3535.7599999999998s)]
*  this crunch. Can we just go to that chart that Brad put out? I think that what a lot of founders [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3540.24s)]
*  don't quite understand still is that things are just never going back to 2021. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3547.8399999999997s)]
*  I think a lot of founders listening to the top of the show where we're talking about [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3553.8399999999997s)]
*  inflation is under control, they see the market rally, Facebook's up 25%. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3557.12s)]
*  They may be thinking, okay, we just have to weather the storm for six months or a year, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3561.9199999999996s)]
*  and then everything's back to normal. And I think what's important to understand is that [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3566.3999999999996s)]
*  the market did bottom out about a month ago and is up pretty nicely. If you see here, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3571.2s)]
*  this is the SAS index. It's the median enterprise value divided by next 12 months revenue. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3575.6s)]
*  And it was really beaten down about at the end of the year. At the end of last year, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3581.9199999999996s)]
*  coming into this year, it was like four to five X multiples of next 12 months revenue for SAS [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3586.16s)]
*  companies. That's all the way up to 6.1 now. So you're talking about 20% to 50% rally for a lot [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3594.3999999999996s)]
*  of companies, which is huge. We're still below the long-term median, which is just under eight. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3600.96s)]
*  But what people need to understand is that even if we revert all the way to the mean [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3608.24s)]
*  of eight, which I think at some point we will, that's still well below the bubble of 21 where [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3612.64s)]
*  they got to 16. So even if things continue to inflate, valuations will still never quite be [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3618.16s)]
*  where they were in 2021. And if you think it's getting back to 12 or 16, it's not happening. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3625.2799999999997s)]
*  In fact, it's not happening. For high growth companies, for high growth companies, in 2021, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3631.04s)]
*  you were in the public markets, you were seeing multiples of 30 to 35 times. Now those companies [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3637.12s)]
*  are maybe at eight to 10 or 12. I think the reliable way that we can look at this for the [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3642.32s)]
*  future is that we're never going to see these kinds of multiples again, unless rates are zero. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3648.6400000000003s)]
*  And all kinds of tourist capital need to find a home to escape 0% returns in every other asset [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3656.0s)]
*  class. But if even the safest asset class now will give you three and a half, 4%, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3663.92s)]
*  this is probably the new normal for quite a long time. And we're going to be back in that early [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3668.72s)]
*  2000s kind of mindset, which takes a lot of hard work to build value around. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3676.16s)]
*  We talked about the sort of whipsaw economy. And there's a lot of mixed inflation data. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3682.08s)]
*  I think founders need to understand that there's a bifurcation. What's happening [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3687.9199999999996s)]
*  in the tech ecosystem is not necessarily what's happening in the overall economy. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3691.9199999999996s)]
*  The tech ecosystem is clearly going through a reset and a recession. Job cuts are now the rule, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3696.56s)]
*  valuations are much lower. Whereas in the overall economy, we saw a jobs report [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3703.12s)]
*  today of over 500,000 new jobs. So the fact of the matter is that even if the overall economy [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3708.16s)]
*  avoids a recession, that doesn't mean that things are just going to bounce back. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3714.88s)]
*  Tech is a depression slash recession. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3719.2s)]
*  Best case is recession for tech. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3721.36s)]
*  Tech is a boom bust cycle. And we have a phenomenal 10 years of boom. Now we're in a bust. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3722.6400000000003s)]
*  And so I would just tell founders, look, it's good if we have a soft landing in the economy. I [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3728.2400000000002s)]
*  wouldn't assume that that's going to happen. I still think there's a really good chance [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3734.32s)]
*  of recession later this year. But it almost doesn't matter for you. What matters is your business and [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3738.48s)]
*  the capital availability for startups, which is fundamentally different and will remain different [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3745.28s)]
*  than it was in 2021. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3751.76s)]
*  Freiburg, you were talking in the chat about Adani Enterprises and Hindenburg doing this [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3753.1200000000003s)]
*  short research and publishing it. Stock has just absolutely gotten clobbered. They were trading at, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3758.4s)]
*  gosh, 4,100 was the 52-week high. And this thing has just cratered in the last five days. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3765.0400000000004s)]
*  I mean, I think the... [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3775.04s)]
*  Want to explain what's going on here? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3775.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, the story that... The conversation I thought it would be interesting for us to have [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3777.04s)]
*  is the role that these short seller research analysts play in driving efficient markets by [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3783.36s)]
*  identifying perhaps things that the market broadly is missing. Particularly given that a few weeks [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3792.56s)]
*  ago, we were all kind of talking about the FTX debacle and how no one was doing their diligence [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3800.32s)]
*  and no one was digging in and no one was kind of revealing publicly what was going on inside of [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3805.92s)]
*  that business that ultimately caused significant losses. The claims made by Hindenburg is that [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3810.4s)]
*  this company Adani, which is founded and run by a guy named Gautam Adani, he started the company [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3816.48s)]
*  like I think 30, 35 years ago. And he's built this thing into this sprawling empire, as people [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3822.96s)]
*  would say, where he owns ports, he owns mining companies, he owns energy transmission businesses, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3830.2400000000002s)]
*  he's got a whole green energy business, and he's taken a bunch of these companies and he's floated [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3836.2400000000002s)]
*  them publicly. So they're all kind of publicly traded. There's some degree of interrelatedness [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3840.56s)]
*  between all these businesses. It reminds me a lot of, I don't know if any of you guys remember [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3845.2s)]
*  Ike Batista out of Brazil? You guys remember this guy? Where he kind of built this sprawling empire, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3850.56s)]
*  very kind of broadly diversified industrial conglomerate with lots of different kind of [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3856.64s)]
*  segments and used a lot of leverage, a lot of debt to grow the business, and a lot of [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3862.56s)]
*  interrelated, interparty transactions. And ultimately, the whole thing kind of came crashing down. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3866.4s)]
*  And that this Adani business, it's super technical and super complicated, all the kind of accounting [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3871.36s)]
*  shenanigans that Hindenburg is claiming has been going on, and capital market shenanigans that [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3876.56s)]
*  they're claiming have been going on with this business. But their kind of report, which I think [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3881.36s)]
*  is like 400 pages long, has caused- The response was 400 pages. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3885.52s)]
*  Their response was long too. Yeah. And then the market shrugged off the response that he put out, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3889.84s)]
*  didn't really care, and they kept selling the stocks off. So there's like seven or eight [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3893.68s)]
*  publicly traded companies, all of which are just getting decimated. Look, I don't have any strong [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3897.2s)]
*  opinion on this business. I kind of skim through the thing. But it really made me [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3901.68s)]
*  question how such a big, call it accounting or capital markets fraud, if it really is that, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3906.24s)]
*  can go on, and how much of a role these sorts of players play in the market, and whether you guys [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3913.3599999999997s)]
*  think that this is a good thing in the market to have these short seller reporters out there [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3919.8399999999997s)]
*  doing this analysis, publishing it. Jason, by the way, you called out Nicola, the electric car [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3924.64s)]
*  company. As you know, Hindenburg put out that Nicola report, stock tanked, right? They claimed [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3930.64s)]
*  it was all fraud, et cetera, and the thing got destroyed. And it was. Trevor Milton got [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3935.2s)]
*  convicted, yeah. Right. And so, I mean, I guess, do you guys think that these guys have a positive [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3938.3999999999996s)]
*  role, net-net, in the market, in kind of identifying and calling out this stuff? Because we all have [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3942.3999999999996s)]
*  friends that are on the wrong side of short sellers, and they complain about it. And it [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3946.64s)]
*  can be really difficult to grow and build a business when people- Elon had these guys literally claiming [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3951.04s)]
*  he was running a fraud for years and years. And it was an intense amount of scrutiny, because when [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3956.08s)]
*  the stock was less trafficked in, when we were in it in 2015 and 16 and 17, that was the constant [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3961.92s)]
*  refrain, and Elon was constantly batting back folks like this, who would make claims. And the [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3967.68s)]
*  way that these guys are allowed to operate is because they use the First Amendment and say, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3973.92s)]
*  we have the right to say this stuff. I think that shorting falls into two buckets. One is, [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3977.6s)]
*  you use it as a hedging instrument. So when we talk about spread trades, like long Google, short [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3982.88s)]
*  Facebook, or long Facebook, short Google, you should be allowed to short. I think that that's [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3987.68s)]
*  a very reasonable thing to do. I think the question is, if you were on the inside of a company and you [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3992.24s)]
*  say XYZ is happening, for example, Trevor Milton, and it causes the stock to go up, and it turns out [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=3999.04s)]
*  to be fraudulent, he's held accountable. The question is, should there be the same responsibility [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4005.12s)]
*  for people on the outside, who, if they have enough distribution, can say the exact opposite of XYZ is [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4010.8799999999997s)]
*  happening. In this case, XYZ is not happening, which then causes the stock to go down. Because [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4016.48s)]
*  what the business model of these short sellers is, write a document, it looks very polished and very [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4020.96s)]
*  credible, put on some positions, then put the document out. If the stock goes down, you close [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4028.64s)]
*  it out. In my opinion, I think that short sellers are really important part of a well functioning [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4034.56s)]
*  market or the ability to short. But what I would like to do is take an extra step, which is [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4040.8s)]
*  you should hold these folks accountable the same way you'd hold an insider accountable, [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4044.8s)]
*  which is almost to the effect of like when you put out the screed, if you make money from it, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4049.28s)]
*  it should sit in escrow, and the SEC should actually adjudicate whether it's true or not. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4053.92s)]
*  So in the case of Hindenburg and Nicola, they shorted the stock, they put out a report, [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4057.92s)]
*  it turned out they were right. All that money is completely well earned. Now what if this Adani [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4063.6000000000004s)]
*  thing turns out to be not true, or true, nobody knows right now, except 50% of the market capital [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4068.7200000000003s)]
*  has already been wiped out. So that's where things I think are are in a bit of a gray area. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4074.72s)]
*  The last thing I'll say is that if you look at the developing world, there's a very gray line [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4079.28s)]
*  between some of the leading entrepreneurs in these governments, because these entrepreneurs [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4085.68s)]
*  are doing the work of some of these governments, whether it's Ike Batista in Brazil in one moment [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4089.76s)]
*  right around natural resources, or Adani and Ambani in India, or a lot of the people that made [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4094.16s)]
*  a lot of money in China, or the people that are making money in in developing markets, Turkey, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4099.92s)]
*  Russia, etc. The government uses very talented entrepreneurs to go and concentrate capital [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4104.72s)]
*  to develop infrastructure progress. We did that in America in the 1800s as well. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4111.76s)]
*  So that's where I think you know, you have to also balance it because his response was basically [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4116.0s)]
*  like this is an attack on India. And in a way, you can see where he's coming from, right, because [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4119.76s)]
*  he's building ports and roads and bridges. And he's like, without this stuff, how is India supposed [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4125.36s)]
*  to even exist in the 21st century? That's a reasonable claim. So I agree with you, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4129.76s)]
*  Friedberg, I don't know whether the report is right or not. But this extra step of actually [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4134.64s)]
*  having the SEC actually tell us what the answer is, I think would be a very important improvement [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4139.6s)]
*  to how this kind of stuff works. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4145.12s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell The other improvement that the SEC has been proposing in Rule 13 F-2 is that [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4146.56s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell People would need to [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4155.6s)]
*  disclose their short positions. This proposed rule would require institutional investment managers, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4158.64s)]
*  I'm reading from the SEC website managers exercising investment discretion over short positions, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4163.360000000001s)]
*  meaning specific, specified thresholds to report on the proposed form SHO information related to [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4166.96s)]
*  end of month short positions and certain data. That is a no brainer. That should absolutely pass. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4173.52s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell The commission would aggregate the resulting data by security, thereby maintaining [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4179.36s)]
*  confidentially of the reporting managers and publicly disseminating the data to all investors. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4185.12s)]
*  This new data would supplement the short sale data. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4189.599999999999s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell I think this relates to overlending of stock, right? I mean, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4191.5199999999995s)]
*  this is less about like, who's doing what, and it's much more about, are we kind of creating [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4194.8s)]
*  critical fail points in the system by seeing over leverage and overlending in certain- [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4199.44s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Well, there should also be some rules about the spreading of fear, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4203.84s)]
*  uncertainty and doubt that FUD that happened with Tesla Q. I mean, paradoxically, you know, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4206.56s)]
*  thousands of anonymous accounts- Aaron Ross Powell No, but people that, but that's an example- [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4213.52s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell That's an example of people essentially lying in public- [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4217.04s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Yes. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4220.96s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell To try to get the stock to move and Tesla is not a fraud. That's a real company. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4221.52s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell I mean, they were waiting car of the year while this was going on. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4225.360000000001s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell But there was a real human cost to that company, right? To employees that got [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4228.160000000001s)]
*  spooked, to partners that may have gotten spooked. The pressure, you know, we saw this, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4232.08s)]
*  the pressure on Elon in those periods of time. And he was, he was like on the knife's edge where [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4236.08s)]
*  there was the potential where the company may not have been able to finance its cash flow needs [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4241.44s)]
*  because of those Tesla Q guys. And so it's not to say that the Tesla Q guys can't say it, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4246.16s)]
*  but they should be forced at some level to prove it if you can create crazy stuff. I posted a link, [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4251.5199999999995s)]
*  by the way, for anybody that's interested in reading this. There's a person called Carson Block [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ymo6Yzjv_KY&t=4256.0s)]
