# E120 Banking crisis and the great VC reset
**All In Podcast:** [March 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0)
*  All right, everybody, welcome to the all in podcast and with me again this week, the Sultan [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=0.0s)]
*  of Science, the Prince of Panic attacks, the Queen of Kin Wah, David Friedberg, the dictator [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5.92s)]
*  Chamath Pali Hoppatea, wearing beautiful Mr. B sweater, and David Sachs, the Rain Man himself. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=10.96s)]
*  Thanks for coming to my Laura Piana dinner on Tuesday, Jaycom. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  That was wonderful. Thanks. At least one bestie showed up for you. Wonderful, wonderful dinner. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=21.12s)]
*  I sat as far away from the Laura Piana people as possible in the arranged seating. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=26.32s)]
*  Thank you for that. I guess maybe you were like, I'm going to contain the damage. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=30.48s)]
*  Bernard Arnaud said, put the all caps got the end. And I said, okay. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=35.04s)]
*  Yeah, he still hurt me. I was like, what's the amuse bouche? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=38.72s)]
*  At dinner, every time he said something, he yelled like he was in all that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  I want another butterscotch pudding. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=51.84s)]
*  The butterscotch pudding is delightful. Sean. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=54.16s)]
*  Sean's like, I'm four feet away from you, me, Jay. You take the caps lock. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=57.52s)]
*  Sean was so embarrassed. Chef Sean crushed it. Chef Sean crushed it. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=61.44s)]
*  Sean crushed it once again. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=64.48s)]
*  Were you sounding alarms when the restaurant like almost ran out of something? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=65.52s)]
*  Alert, alert, alert. Restaurant is running low on coffee. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=69.44s)]
*  We're dangerously low on caviar on this white asparagus. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=73.68s)]
*  All right, everybody, welcome to the pod where we, you know, try to inform you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=84.0s)]
*  We try to make some jokes here. I just want to make what is a little bit of an opening [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=98.56s)]
*  statement here. It's not an apology and it's not a victory lap in any way. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  But there's been a lot of attention, I think, on the last episode of the pod and perhaps some [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=107.36s)]
*  tweeting from two of the four besties this past weekend. I saw and I, you know, I'll let you speak [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=113.12s)]
*  for yourself here, Sachs, and we're going to get into the timeline of what's occurred. And then [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=120.48s)]
*  what are potential outcomes here and solutions to the banking issues that we've witnessed in? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  What is a week since the bank run on Silicon Valley Bank and the shutdown on Friday? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=130.4s)]
*  But what I saw, and again, speaking only for myself here, was absolutely terrifying up close and [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=135.6s)]
*  personally watching people pulling money out of banks and watching people have to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=140.88s)]
*  set up loans to hit their payroll. And this was like one of those surreal moments in a movie where [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=145.44s)]
*  like a meteor is coming towards earth and you see it in the telescope and nobody else sees it or only [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=151.04s)]
*  a small number of people in the observatory see it. And I think part of the reason people listen [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=154.96s)]
*  to this podcast is because we are insiders and speaking again, just for myself, I'm always trying [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=159.2s)]
*  to be exceptionally candid and transparent with the audience. Additionally, I make jokes. So [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  sometimes you might laugh during this podcast or you might laugh when you're reading my tweets. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=169.76s)]
*  And that's part of what I do. Now, I also realize that we have an audience now that is larger than [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  I think any of us expected for this podcast. I certainly magnitude larger than I expected. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=180.88s)]
*  And frankly, I didn't know if this podcast was going to make it past 50 or 100 episodes and my [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=185.6s)]
*  Twitter following count doubled since we started this podcast. And that's because you tried to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=190.72s)]
*  ruin the pun. I think it was because of the caps locks. But anyway, putting all that aside, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=195.04s)]
*  what I would like to say as well is like, we are living in a situation that is unprecedented. I [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=200.0s)]
*  think the alarm bell I sounded, you know, was because I saw a fire. We'll get into the timeline [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=206.16s)]
*  here. But I sounded that alarm bell after Silicon Valley Bank was put into receivership. And when I [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  saw additional bank runs occurring, I wouldn't change it. I think these were the right the right [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=218.16s)]
*  thing to do was to inform folks. Now, I did use all caps, perhaps a little too much. That was a [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=222.56s)]
*  little bit of a bit if people didn't understand that maybe I need to adjust my communication style [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  now that this thing is so popular. But I stand by my mode of operating in the world, which is I [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=231.52s)]
*  always want to be candid with people, I always want to tell the truth. And yeah, sometimes I make [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=238.16s)]
*  jokes about life and, you know, dealing with these stressful situations. That's it. It's not an [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=242.72s)]
*  apology. It's more of an explainer. And, yeah, maybe I need to adjust the caps lock or how I [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=247.76s)]
*  deliver stuff. But I stand by the message of what I said. And I think it's important for us to maybe [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=254.32s)]
*  look at the series of events and misinformation that has spread because there are people literally [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=258.48s)]
*  blaming venture capitalists for the bank run that is now systematic. And the balance sheets of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=264.56s)]
*  multiple banks around the world. And I think that's it'd be great for you to maybe just comment on [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=272.15999999999997s)]
*  the week that was and the timeline of events. Yeah. So as usual, you're not apologizing? No, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=277.2s)]
*  absolutely not apologizing, but we'll recognize that this platform is bigger and that maybe on [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=281.76s)]
*  the margins, I could adjust my communication strategy. But Chris, there's a lot of people [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=286.64s)]
*  who don't know that I make jokes. And maybe people don't understand what I'm joking and when I'm [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=290.64s)]
*  serious, right? And so Jason, what would you change? Was there anything you change? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=295.36s)]
*  I think I might not have used a Mad Max image and gif about the end of the world [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=300.08s)]
*  because people are too stupid to understand that's a joke and a fictional movie. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  I see. So you find yelling effective? It depends. Well, J Cal, I agree that I don't think you have [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=312.4s)]
*  anything to apologize for in terms of the substance of what you're trying to get across. I personally [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=319.36s)]
*  could have done without the all caps. It was a bit. Yeah. What you're basically saying is nobody [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=323.52s)]
*  should listen to you because you're not that important. And I wholeheartedly agree with that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=328.48s)]
*  No, I'm saying understand. I might make a joke. Consider me more in the Bill Maher category. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=334.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Let's go back. Let's go back and look at the timeline because there are now serious [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=339.68s)]
*  accusations and I would call it really scapegoating of it. And it wasn't just you. It was me and Bill [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=344.32s)]
*  Ackman. In fact, the Wall Street Journal editorial board, which I respect a lot, mischaracterize what [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=349.92s)]
*  me and Ackman were trying to do in terms of drawing attention to a regional banking crisis [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  in progress, a run on the banks. They called it spreading panic. I don't know how you tweet [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=361.2s)]
*  or publicly discuss a run on the bank that's currently happening needs to be addressed with [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=367.04s)]
*  an immediate federal intervention. I don't know how you can discuss it without then having someone [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=372.24s)]
*  else mischaracterize it as trying to spread a panic. But J Cal, the Wall Street Journal [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=377.76s)]
*  editorial board didn't mention you. So you're off the hook. They didn't know who you were. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=383.36s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. But no, but seriously, so I went back and looked at the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=387.36s)]
*  timeline of all of this. And so first of all, we have to understand that this banking crisis now [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=392.0s)]
*  has swept in five banks, five bank failures. First there was Silvergate, but everyone dismissed that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  because it was some weird crypto bank. Then it was SVB, but everyone sort of dismissed it because [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=404.32s)]
*  they said it was based on panicky VCs rather than the systemic problem in the banking system. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=408.72s)]
*  Then it was Signature Bank, which got seized on Sunday, which I think utterly refuted the idea [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  that this was just a Silicon Valley problem. Then you had the fed step in and backstop First [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=419.12s)]
*  Republic, which would have been the next dominant fall if it wasn't backstopped. And then five, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=425.04s)]
*  you had Credit Suisse, basically, again, avoid an outright failure because they got backstopped by [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=430.48s)]
*  the Swiss government. So we now have five banks in roughly a week, and these are not small banks. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=436.32s)]
*  Credit Suisse is a GSIB, a globally systemically important bank, and the other ones are top 20, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=443.52s)]
*  top 30 type banks. We're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in deposits. So clearly, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=448.56s)]
*  there's a larger phenomenon going on here. And frankly, it's being caused not by anything VCs [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=452.15999999999997s)]
*  did because VCs are just depositors. We're just one class of depositors. And depositors are not [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=458.8s)]
*  to blame for what's going on here. What's going on is that these banks have huge unrealized losses [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=464.32s)]
*  on their balance sheet. And the losses have come from the sunspiken interest rates. That's what's [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=470.88s)]
*  going on. The sunspiken interest rates is because we've had the most rapid Fed tightening cycle in [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=475.84s)]
*  our lifetimes. In the last year, the Fed funds rates gone from roughly zero to almost 5%. That [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=480.4s)]
*  has broken a lot of things. And the banks which have broken first are the ones that had pre-existing [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=485.68s)]
*  problems. And they had a horrible risk management. But that's who gets broken first in a stress test, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=491.92s)]
*  right? It's the most poorly run banks, the ones with pre-existing issues. But just because they [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=497.76s)]
*  went first doesn't mean that others don't have similar kinds of issues. Now, I'm not saying this [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=502.0s)]
*  in any way to be panicking, but those banks will be fine. But there are larger issues in the banking [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=509.04s)]
*  system that are worth talking about. And to the point about whether VCs could have spread this. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=513.44s)]
*  Jay, you're absolutely right about the timeline. I mean, I went back and checked. I personally never [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=518.24s)]
*  tweeted anything about SVB until Friday afternoon, when SVB was already in receivership and the run on [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=522.64s)]
*  the bank had already started with Signature and First Republic. And we could see it with our own [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=529.76s)]
*  eyes. And then this pod didn't drop the one where we talked about this problem didn't drop until [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=533.0400000000001s)]
*  Saturday morning when the banks were already closed. And by Sunday night, the Fed had acted [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=538.0s)]
*  and basically implemented our recommendations, which was to basically intervene. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=543.2s)]
*  So I don't know how you can blame this search for scapegoats, I think is getting out of control. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=547.5200000000001s)]
*  And it's just not factually accurate. And you know, it's convenient to make tech, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=552.32s)]
*  which is hated right now, Chamath and Friedberg, you know, the scapegoat venture capital is [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=557.36s)]
*  obviously the part of tech that people might hate the most or the easiest target. But let's talk [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=561.36s)]
*  about the Fed raised those rates because of inflation and inflation happened because of [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=566.8000000000001s)]
*  out of control spending due to COVID. And then the second administration, so you had a Republican [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=572.64s)]
*  administration that spent a lot of money and then a Democratic administration, Chamath, that spent a [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=577.84s)]
*  lot of money. So maybe we could even go backwards from Fed fund rate going, you know, what looks [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=581.92s)]
*  like parabolic when you look at the chart. Maybe you could speak to what got us to the Fed making [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=588.72s)]
*  those decisions Chamath or Friedberg. Maybe I can just do a little cleanup on what [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=593.4399999999999s)]
*  Sack said. I think the issues at Credit Suisse are different than the issues at First Republic. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=597.44s)]
*  And the issues at First Republic are different than those other three banks. The other three [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=604.16s)]
*  banks, David, that you mentioned, Signature, Silicon Valley Bank, and Silvergate, all had [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=607.84s)]
*  very traditional liquidity crises, right? We talked about this last week, which is duration [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=617.28s)]
*  mismatching, where you have depositors who want their money today, but you have assets that [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=621.52s)]
*  mature in 10 years. And as a result, you have huge unrealized losses if you all of a sudden [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=628.64s)]
*  cash them out today versus waiting 10 years. I think what's happening at First Republic is [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=634.24s)]
*  really just about making sure that that loan book and the depositors can get parked into a [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=639.36s)]
*  combination set of banks that can take care of the balance sheet so that there are no more [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=646.96s)]
*  liquidity issues. At Credit Suisse, they have an enormous amount of liquidity. What that was, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  was I think a lot of speculation around whether they would default on their bonds or whether they [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=658.08s)]
*  would theoretically need more liquidity. But the balance sheet itself was not only liquid, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=662.88s)]
*  but also very solvent. So I think that was just more of a panicky reaction to comments from a 9.9% [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=668.48s)]
*  shareholder who just said that they can't put in any more equity. But even then I went back, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=676.08s)]
*  this is the chairman of the Saudi National Bank. He was asked on Bloomberg, would you give Credit [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=680.96s)]
*  Suisse more money? And he had a very reasonable answer, but it was snapshot in a very awkward way. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=685.36s)]
*  The first sentence was under no circumstances would he do that. Okay, now if you stop there, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=692.08s)]
*  you could be panicked. But the rest of it made a lot of sense, which is he said, look, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=697.9200000000001s)]
*  in Saudi Arabia, if we go above 10%, we have to go through regulatory approvals domestically, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=702.0s)]
*  and there are regulatory approvals abroad. That's a big hill to climb. And all of a sudden, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=707.84s)]
*  it no longer becomes a financial investment, it becomes a somewhat political investment. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  And so we're very happy at 9.9%. That was the totality of his statement. But if you just cherry [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=716.96s)]
*  pick the first 45 seconds and ran with it, which people on the internet did, this is sort of what [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=721.76s)]
*  caused that second level wave panic at a GSIB. And then the Swiss National Bank stepped in. And [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=726.96s)]
*  I think that that panic has largely gone. Okay, so what is the real issue? The issue again is, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=732.72s)]
*  I think we have had a bit of supervisory failure here, right? Because we all know this in any [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  industry. If you let capitalism go totally unchecked, shareholders will demand immediate [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=744.32s)]
*  profits today. It happens in every industry, except in ones where you can basically gamble [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=751.6s)]
*  on future profits. And that's what tech does. But every other shareholder in every other asset [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=758.08s)]
*  class demands money today. And that's the same for banks. The problem is the banks are a highly [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=763.36s)]
*  regulated business. They are supposed to be supervised by the regulators. And this is a [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=768.08s)]
*  very clear example where why is there not a real time spreadsheet? I mean, this is not complicated [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=774.5600000000001s)]
*  stuff, where assets and liabilities and duration mismatching can be known on a real time basis [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=781.28s)]
*  where the San Francisco Fed, Mary Daly, should have a report that's escalated to her when SVB [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=786.72s)]
*  got over their ski tips, which they did in Q4 of 2022. So I think the real question that has to be [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=794.16s)]
*  examined is where were these folks for the last four months when they could have done something, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=800.4s)]
*  not just about this, but rules in general for all banks that are not the GSIBs. And I think that's [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=805.68s)]
*  a very important question that politicians need to get to that root of. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=810.48s)]
*  Aaron Norris Friedberg, we discussed this article from Seeking Alpha, which came out on [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=813.84s)]
*  let me get the exact date here, December 19. Title of this Seeking Alpha story is SVB financial, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=819.84s)]
*  colon blow up risk. And the summary in three bullet points says bullet point one, potential [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=827.6s)]
*  losses in loan portfolios could severely impair book equity. Number two, unrealized losses [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  in hold to maturity portfolio already equal to book equity. Number three, funding environment [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=840.4000000000001s)]
*  for startups were pressure deposit base, adding even more pressure to the balance sheet. In other [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=846.0s)]
*  words, startups spending money to cover their burn rate. Friedberg, and obviously we had the [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  Dodd-Frank rules lessened or loosened under the previous administration. And that specifically [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=855.12s)]
*  was driven by Silicon Valley Bank that had a big part in that. So looking back on this, and people [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=861.7600000000001s)]
*  do want to place blame. Let's talk about the effects that occurred because this was hiding in [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=866.96s)]
*  plain sight literally in December in an article that looks like it was written by somebody who [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=871.6800000000001s)]
*  went into a time machine and said, how do I warn people in December about this? Maybe you could [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=877.36s)]
*  talk about the Fed's interest rates, the spending and what led up to this look issue with the banks. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=882.1600000000001s)]
*  You guys remember when we started this podcast three years ago, we were like, they're going to [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=888.1600000000001s)]
*  shut down the economy. There's going to be crazy second and third order effects of doing that. No [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=893.12s)]
*  one knows what they're going to be. Here they are. And I think that's like the root of what is a [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=898.0799999999999s)]
*  rippling effect. You can't shut down the global economy and stop trade and stop people and have [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=904.24s)]
*  the government step in to write a giant check and not expect that you're going to have to cash that [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=912.16s)]
*  check at some point. That's effectively what I think we've been kicking down the road here. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=916.7199999999999s)]
*  The way we initially tried to resolve the problem was to drop rates to zero and then spend our way [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=922.24s)]
*  back to a growing supported economy and then overshot, ended up with too much stimulation, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=929.04s)]
*  too much stimulus, too lower rates for too long, responded too quickly, whiplashed back. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=936.4s)]
*  At the end of the day, there was a giant gaping hole blown into the global economy [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=942.64s)]
*  when we shut down the world from COVID. There's no blame. It's just what happened. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=947.84s)]
*  And when that happened, there was a massive cost that had to be borne at some point. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=954.1600000000001s)]
*  And it's going to get borne at some point. And the rippling in a pond, you don't know where the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=959.0400000000001s)]
*  ripple is going to hit, what part of the pond, what leaves it's going to hit. That's what's going on [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=965.2800000000001s)]
*  still. And it's such a dynamical system. It's so hard to say with linear certainty, this is what [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=969.2800000000001s)]
*  should be done and what could have been done and what they should have done at the time. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=974.56s)]
*  No one had that predictive capacity back then. They did what they needed to do. People thought [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=978.16s)]
*  that they should have dropped rates. They said we should have written all these big stimulus checks. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=982.56s)]
*  Some people said you shouldn't. Some people said you did. Certainly some people are being proven [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=986.8s)]
*  right and some people are being proven wrong. But at the end of the day, the economic loss [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=991.68s)]
*  that was realized at that period of time, we're still trying to get out of it and we're still [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=997.1199999999999s)]
*  recovering from it. And I think that's a big part of what's being eaten up right now. And you're [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1001.44s)]
*  going to see it in the wipeout of certain equity. You're going to see it in the wipeout [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1004.96s)]
*  of these banks, of the assets that they hold and these portfolios. And the effects of that are [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1010.08s)]
*  obviously still being felt. Sacks, do you agree that mistakes, that this, there isn't somebody [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1015.84s)]
*  to blame because it is clear that the Fed said inflation is transitory. That was wrong. And then [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1024.8s)]
*  they went faster than in history to raise the rates. Those seem like two glaring mistakes. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1032.6399999999999s)]
*  And then the Todd, the Dodd, Frank loosening under Trump and with Silicon Valley Bank pushing them. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1038.3999999999999s)]
*  That seemed like a really big mistake. By the way, I wasn't saying the Fed's not to blame for not [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1044.32s)]
*  raising rates fast enough. That was because you guys remember I was the first person to talk about [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1048.1599999999999s)]
*  what Stan Druckenmiller had said that they're not raising rates fast enough, that we've got [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1052.72s)]
*  massive inflation. We should have been raising rates. I was the first person on the show to be [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1056.0s)]
*  barking that. So don't forget, I was there pretty early. What I was pointing out was we shut down [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1059.76s)]
*  the economy during COVID, the global economy. That is the main cause. That is the cannonball [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1065.92s)]
*  that got blown through the ship. And everything else is plumbing and patching and work to try and [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1071.28s)]
*  keep the ship afloat. And we're still dealing with that. And at the same time, as you guys know, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1075.92s)]
*  we've been loading the ship up with debt, the global ship, the global economy with debt, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1079.84s)]
*  360% global debt to global GDP ratio right now. And as that ship has gotten heavier and heavier [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1084.48s)]
*  to have a giant hole blown in the side while you're trying to do all this patchwork with all this [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1090.8799999999999s)]
*  debt weighing on it, it's a critical challenge. And it's one that we're feeling acutely here. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1094.08s)]
*  They're feeling it in Europe now. And we're certainly going to see the global ramifications [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1099.12s)]
*  as we try and fix this economic catastrophe that was caused by COVID at the same time that we've [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1103.4399999999998s)]
*  been spending our way into a happier future that it turns out we have to pay the bills for at some [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1108.88s)]
*  point. Sacks your response. The question of who you blame for this banking crisis has really become [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1114.5600000000002s)]
*  a political Rorschach test. And I've seen that there are six different parties that people want [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1119.44s)]
*  to blame in this situation. And there's some merit to all of them. But the degrees are very [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1124.96s)]
*  different. Number one, let's go through them. Okay, number one, the bank management of all [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1130.48s)]
*  these different banks clearly very poor risk management didn't do a good job. They are to [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1134.32s)]
*  blame. However, and Chamath is right about these banks, they differ in the details. But the point [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1139.76s)]
*  is that they're all operating under conditions of extreme stress. Where did that come from? Number [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1145.04s)]
*  two, the feds rapid rate tightening cycle. Clearly, I think that the combination of poor [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1148.8799999999999s)]
*  risk management with the spiking interest rates that basically has precipitated this larger problem. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1156.0s)]
*  Number three is I think the Biden administration spending which in fairness started with COVID [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1161.44s)]
*  before Biden, but Biden really intensified it. And then I think it really compounded the problem in [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1167.52s)]
*  the summer of 2021 by claiming that inflation was transitory when it wasn't. That allowed them to [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1172.48s)]
*  keep spending and keep printing money and kept QE going for another six months. That created the [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1177.44s)]
*  bubble of 2021. Everything got super frothy. And then that made the rate height cycle even more [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1182.4s)]
*  vicious because you started six months later, they could have started six months earlier, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1189.2s)]
*  and it could have been more gradual. And I think that really was a disaster for the economy. Okay, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1193.6s)]
*  number four, the D reg in 2018. I think Elizabeth Warren and Ro Khanna have made what I would call [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1198.08s)]
*  a compelling case that the D reg in 2018 have contributed to this problem. I think in hindsight, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1204.24s)]
*  creating a two tier system of banks, where one tier are the systemically important banks who [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1211.9199999999998s)]
*  are completely guaranteed and backed off by the federal government, and then a lower tier, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1217.12s)]
*  a second tier of regional banks was a poison chalice for the regional banking system. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1222.0s)]
*  Because in the short term, it meant they were more lightly regulated, which may be appropriate for [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1227.6s)]
*  smaller banks that aren't these mega banks. However, it has also now I think created a [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1233.6799999999998s)]
*  situation where people are less confident about them. And so the money flows are going from the [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1237.9199999999998s)]
*  regional banks to the systemically important banks, the SIPs. So like I said, it might be a [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1242.56s)]
*  double edged sword. And I think we're gonna have to look at those regulations and figure out what's [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1247.44s)]
*  the right regulatory regime to create confidence in the regional banking system. We want a thriving [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1251.44s)]
*  regional banking system. And so the question is, what's the right regulations that get us there? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1257.28s)]
*  And then the final two that we can talk about later are I'm hearing wokeness getting blamed, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1262.0s)]
*  which, listen, I think that wokeness was a distraction. There were a lot of crazy programs [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1266.8s)]
*  happening at these banks. But listen, if wokeness was the key factor, the whole Fortune 500 would be [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1271.44s)]
*  out of business because because they all do this stuff. They all do this stuff. So I think I think [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1276.48s)]
*  we're going back to the well a little too often on that critique. And I don't want to I don't want [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1280.72s)]
*  to burn that critique out because I think that wokeness is bad. But it's not the key reason why [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1284.96s)]
*  this stuff happened. And then the last group that gets wokeness, we could also maybe frame it as ESG [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1290.16s)]
*  more broadly as the distraction because wokeness is charged. Yes, it is real. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1296.0s)]
*  Yeah, what I would say for sure is that if these banks have spent as much time on risk management [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1300.24s)]
*  as they did on ESG or on woke, then this crisis wouldn't happen. So definitely distraction, but [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1304.48s)]
*  not not the thing that like specifically caused it. And then just the final thing is VCs. And I [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1309.92s)]
*  just can't fathom at this point, given the multiple bank failures, given that we see the larger problem [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1315.28s)]
*  of unrealized losses on bank balance sheets, that somehow any class of depositors would be blamed [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1320.6399999999999s)]
*  for this. That just makes no sense to me. Chamath. I think the VC, the critique is specific [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1326.32s)]
*  to Silicon Valley Bank, because I think and this article was in the Wall Street Journal. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1331.2s)]
*  But what it shows is a really complicated intertwined relationship between VCs and [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1335.6799999999998s)]
*  Silicon Valley Bank, where, you know, VCs were given very cheap interest rate loans, they were [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1340.48s)]
*  given GP call lines of credit, they were given LP lines of credit. And then those same VCs would be [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1346.32s)]
*  directing their companies to put their deposits inside of SVB, who would then take those deposits [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1352.08s)]
*  and buy and buy risk. And while the reality is all of this stuff will come to light, because I think [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1356.8799999999999s)]
*  it will get exposed as we go through congressional hearings on all of this. But I think the I think [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1362.32s)]
*  pointing the finger at VCs in this specific case is somewhat warranted, because there was a little [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1367.76s)]
*  bit of people working in lockstep together, and there was a lack of functional responsibility around [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1372.56s)]
*  how to be a true fiduciary. So if you come to a board, and your founder is 22 years old, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1377.92s)]
*  and you give that person 15 or $20 million, I think it makes a fair amount of sense that you [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1385.44s)]
*  are supposed to be the more sophisticated financial person in that room. And if you have incentives [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1391.28s)]
*  that aren't properly disclosed to that CEO, and now a set of decisions are made, I think that that [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1399.28s)]
*  there should be some accountability for that, or at least some exploration of why that happened. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1405.52s)]
*  Aaron Norris I just want to make sure the audience understands this, because it is a bit in the weeds, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1409.1200000000001s)]
*  and it's a bit inside baseball. What you're saying, Chamath is, if I can summarize it, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1412.32s)]
*  there are people who are the adults in the room, venture capitalists, they have deposits at [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1417.3600000000001s)]
*  Silicon Valley Bank, they also might have loans that are fantastic with Silicon Valley Bank, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1421.44s)]
*  I have a mortgage for this office from Silicon Valley Bank. And I talked about how on the last [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1426.72s)]
*  episode, how great it is they come, they open wine with you, it's white glove service that you [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1431.04s)]
*  wouldn't get at another bank. And then they might have loans against what's called the GP [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1434.0s)]
*  carry or the GP share, or they might have mortgages. And so there's a conflict there. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1441.12s)]
*  If you're a venture capitalist, and you're directing a 22 year old CEO to Silicon Valley Bank, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1447.04s)]
*  maybe you're doing that is, I guess you're saying could be explored. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1451.52s)]
*  Chomsky No, the bigger conflict of interest. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1456.32s)]
*  Aaron Norris And in some cases, Silicon Valley Bank is a limited partner in all of these funds. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1457.84s)]
*  Chomsky Yes, that's the bigger conflict of interest. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1462.24s)]
*  Aaron Norris Okay, hold on, we have to explain that. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1463.76s)]
*  Chomsky No, the bigger conflict of interest. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1465.52s)]
*  Aaron Norris So imagine a situation, you go and start a fund, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1465.6s)]
*  Silicon Valley Bank comes to you and says, let me be a limited partner and invest with you, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1469.28s)]
*  let me give you some amount of money. I don't know where that money comes from from Silicon [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1474.08s)]
*  Valley Bank. Well, let's be realistic, more like 25, 50 million, 100 million. Okay, this is a lot [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1477.52s)]
*  of money. So a million kind of is whitewashing this problem. So you give them a reasonable amount of [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1484.0s)]
*  money. They're like, wow, I have tremendous loyalty for you. Thank you. Well, do you need [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1488.72s)]
*  anything else? Do you need personal loans? Do you need lines of credit for your business? Sure, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1493.3600000000001s)]
*  why not? I take those two. And invariably on the back end, now your loyalty obviously builds up [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1497.28s)]
*  again, nothing, none of this is wrong. But this is what's happening. And then you tell your companies [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1503.04s)]
*  to keep your deposits there. Maybe the cash management program is not as strong as it would [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1507.84s)]
*  have been if you were more circumspect and you didn't have those incentives to direct people to [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1512.0s)]
*  one institution only. In any other part of the market, so in the public markets, as an example, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1516.16s)]
*  there is such a bar for disclosure. Okay, and I cannot stress this to you enough, related party [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1522.88s)]
*  transactions, all of this stuff, we have to tell everything, not just for us. But even if our like [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1528.3200000000002s)]
*  sister or brother or mother may have a transaction with an entity that we're doing a deal with, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1535.52s)]
*  and it just isn't the case in private markets. And so it's not to say that anything untoward [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1540.48s)]
*  happened. But when people point the finger at VCs, I think they are pointing to this whole set [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1545.44s)]
*  of issues and asking the question, shouldn't there have been more disclosure and transparency around [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1550.56s)]
*  it? And now that this has come to pass, shouldn't we explore it? And I think that's what the Wall [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1555.68s)]
*  Street Journal did. They started pulling on this sweater thread. And my guess is that you're going [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1560.4s)]
*  to find a whole ball of yarn at the end of it. Sax, what do you think of this? I think [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1565.44s)]
*  Chirmoth makes a fair point that if VCs have SVB as an investor, and then they're directing [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1568.96s)]
*  startups to use SVB, that is a conflict that should be disclosed. By the way, we never did [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1575.6000000000001s)]
*  either one of those things. We never had SVB as a limited partner. And we also never directed our [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1581.2s)]
*  startups to bank at SVB. I don't know why we'd ever do that. Moreover, I always tried to talk [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1586.16s)]
*  founders out of taking venture debt, whether from SVB or elsewhere. So listen, we'd be clear about [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1591.04s)]
*  that. And to be clear, I never directed anybody to a specific bank. I always told people to get [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1596.24s)]
*  two or three banks and have redundancy. Totally. Yeah, totally. And look, founders have multiple [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1600.88s)]
*  VCs typically on their board. So the idea that like any one VC directs them which bank to use, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1606.16s)]
*  that's not realistically what happens at these startups. But look, I think Chirmoth is right [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1611.6s)]
*  that when there is a bank failure or any kind of failure this big, then all the practices are going [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1617.44s)]
*  to be under a microscope and there's going to be some scrutiny of this. And maybe there should be. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1622.4s)]
*  But my larger point is we're now operating in an environment in which clearly there's a larger set [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1626.5600000000002s)]
*  of stresses on the banking system. We've already had now five bank failures or near failures. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1632.3200000000002s)]
*  Moreover, do any of us believe that this is over? Or do we believe there are more shoes to drop? If [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1637.76s)]
*  we believe that there are more shoes to drop, we may not know exactly what they are. But I think [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1643.44s)]
*  all of us probably believe that we're not at the end of this. But just to finish the thought, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1647.76s)]
*  if we believe there will be more shoes to drop, then clearly the issues cannot just be limited to [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1652.0s)]
*  Silicon Valley. They have to be a larger set of issues. I think that it's important to understand [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1657.44s)]
*  the facility that the Fed created. So what the Fed did this weekend is essentially create a buyer of [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1662.88s)]
*  last resort again. Now, how did they do this? So all of these banks basically have assets [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1670.32s)]
*  that they bought for a dollar and are now worth 95 cents. And that's what's creating this whole [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1676.32s)]
*  issue or 80 cents or 85 cents, you pick the number, but they're not worth the dollar that [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1680.48s)]
*  they bought. What the Fed basically said is, okay, give me that asset, give me that bond. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1684.0s)]
*  I will value it at a dollar and I will give you a dollar as a loan. And you will pay me interest. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1691.2s)]
*  And the interest rate, I think is what's called OIS. And they added 10 basis points on top. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1697.44s)]
*  So I think it's about 4.9%. So what it allows all of these banks, and if you take all of the [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1701.76s)]
*  banks that are not the top four in America, so the top four are JP Morgan, B of A, City and Wells. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1708.64s)]
*  So just ignore those for one second. The other end banks, if you look at all of the assets that [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1714.96s)]
*  are underwater, because of all the rate hikes that Sachs talked about, and you add up all those losses, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1720.24s)]
*  that is about $2 trillion. And the Fed didn't announce that there was a beginning and an end [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1727.2s)]
*  to this program other than saying these would be one year loans. And so I think the exposure [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1734.24s)]
*  for the American banking system at a minimum is going to be this $2 trillion. Because now the [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1740.24s)]
*  incentive, if you're a banker right now running one of these banks that has not gone under, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1746.88s)]
*  is to immediately go to the Fed, put all of those assets to them, get a loan, and now take that and [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1752.48s)]
*  buy different assets, different bonds, different US treasuries that are yielding much more [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1760.48s)]
*  than what your old treasuries were yielding. And I think that's the arbitrage that we've [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1767.84s)]
*  unfortunately created. And the other question now, though, however, is what does that mean for the [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1772.4s)]
*  top four banks? Right? Because if it's $2 trillion for everybody else but the top four, what's the [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1777.92s)]
*  gap for the top four? That looks like it's somewhere between $1 trillion and $2 trillion. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1784.0s)]
*  So that's another amount of money we're going to have to cover. The Fed will have to backstop. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1788.72s)]
*  And then, as Friedberg said, these checks always come due. What do we do in a year? Because in a year, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1794.24s)]
*  the problem is the only way to make the banks in a position to repay this much money in one year [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1803.3600000000001s)]
*  is to cut interest rates so massively that these assets massively inflate and now all of a sudden [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1811.04s)]
*  you're in a position to cover this. So it's a very- [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1817.6s)]
*  Describe what that delta is, because it's about they're down 15%, 10% in book value, these [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1820.48s)]
*  longer-term treasuries. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1826.48s)]
*  It depends on the security. Again, it depends on what they bought. We don't really know enough [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1826.9599999999998s)]
*  detail, so I don't want to guess. But if you own these 10-year treasuries, you could be off 10% or [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1830.9599999999998s)]
*  15%. If you own mortgage-backed securities, it could be off a little bit more. If you own short-term [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1834.9599999999998s)]
*  securities, they're off a little bit less. But these are with the government. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1840.08s)]
*  You get a loan collateralized by these assets, so you're still holding them, right? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1843.6s)]
*  Yes, and they mature. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1847.76s)]
*  So if the Fed takes an emergency posture and says, okay, guys, we want to avert a crisis in a year [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1849.12s)]
*  from now, and we're going to cut rates, these assets that these banks own will be worth more, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1854.7199999999998s)]
*  which will allow them to repay the loan. As far as I can tell, all we've done is we've kicked the can [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1860.3999999999999s)]
*  down the road for a year. But I do think it's important for people to realize this doesn't [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1867.6799999999998s)]
*  solve the problem. It just means that mark your calendar for a year from now. We have a problem [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1872.64s)]
*  on March 15, 2024. Because all those folks that took money, what do we do? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1878.72s)]
*  Yeah, and so a year to work it out, Freeberg, would seem like a good idea because [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1884.4s)]
*  the Fed is fighting inflation. They seem to have gotten some portion of it under control. It's not [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1891.76s)]
*  out of control, right inflation. And maybe if they can slowly, you know, either start rate [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1896.88s)]
*  cuts or pause. So let's shift the discussion to hey, what are the changes we need to make to the [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1902.8000000000002s)]
*  system? And how do we think this plays out over the next year? Freeberg, Shamath had one suggestion, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1908.88s)]
*  which was all of these banks should have a disclosure statement, mark to market every day, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1914.4s)]
*  week, month, quarter, whatever it is, just like circles, USDC, their stablecoin has a page with [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1919.6000000000001s)]
*  their disclosures of all their holdings. So that seems to be a very productive one, we should have [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1926.4s)]
*  them mark to market the Dodd-Frank stuff, as Sac said, you know, Elizabeth Warren, probably correct, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1930.48s)]
*  we need to reverse that. So those are two very tangible suggestions. What are your suggestions? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1936.64s)]
*  Real time dashboard, we need to have a real time dashboard at every single Fed that allows them [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1941.0400000000002s)]
*  for every bank that they supervise to know in real time, they should the public see that or it. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1947.76s)]
*  I'm not sure that should be true. But they are their supervisors, they should see it, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1952.88s)]
*  they should choose to ignore it. But they should not not have it. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1959.0400000000002s)]
*  Freeberg, what are your suggestions going forward as to how we can learn from this situation? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1963.0400000000002s)]
*  Forget about the cannonball, as you vividly expressed there, I think very well, great analogy. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1968.88s)]
*  But just going forward, how do we keep the ship from taking on water, if we do have a [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1975.3600000000001s)]
*  cannonball hit it again? Now we got a hard, that's a hard equation to solve. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1981.84s)]
*  We got a lot of demands. That's why I'm asking you. That's why I'm asking you. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1987.76s)]
*  What are your suggestions? A lot of demands for money. You guys see, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1990.32s)]
*  I think there's a lot of things that are seem unrelated that are all pretty related right now. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=1995.9199999999998s)]
*  There's a massive protest underway by labor in France. There's a massive protest underway [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2002.0s)]
*  in the Netherlands. There's strikes on the underground in London. When we talk about global [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2008.48s)]
*  debt, and US debt, we often, I don't think account for all the debt, which also includes [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2014.88s)]
*  promissory obligations made to a workforce, global workforce that's been working for decades. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2022.24s)]
*  Individuals that have spent their whole lives committed to some company or to some government [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2028.08s)]
*  working with the expectation that they're going to retire and have some benefits paid to them. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2033.68s)]
*  There's this massive underfunding of those benefits and those pools of capital. We very [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2038.3200000000002s)]
*  quickly talk about unfunded pension liabilities, but when you actually account for the number of [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2043.28s)]
*  people and the amount of capital that those people are expecting, that the workforce, [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2050.32s)]
*  the global workforce is expecting to be paid to them in retirement, both public and private, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2054.56s)]
*  it's a massive amount of money that's not funded today. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2060.8s)]
*  And you start to see the cracks in the system when that population says, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2064.16s)]
*  my pension payments are not keeping up with interest, with inflation, or when there's a [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2070.16s)]
*  threat that pension payments or retirement benefits are going to kick in at a later age, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2076.08s)]
*  or you're not going to get them fast enough, you're not going to get as many as you thought you were [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2080.3999999999996s)]
*  going to get. We have that problem in the United States in the form of social security and these [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2083.04s)]
*  underfunded pension liabilities. That is the critical macro tension in this equation that I [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2086.56s)]
*  think drives the real problem that's going to come to a head at some point. We blew a hole in [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2092.64s)]
*  the boat, but we're also forgetting that there's a massive amount of weight that's going to drop on [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2100.16s)]
*  the boat. And I think that it's a really hard equation to solve. We can talk about keeping [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2105.44s)]
*  banks solvent and all this sort of stuff. At the end of the day, the central bank, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2111.2s)]
*  it appears in the United States and probably globally, it's going to be one big bank. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2113.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. They're basically going to take on the whole balance sheet themselves. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2117.44s)]
*  And at the same time, you've got a lot of folks saying, I want to get paid more. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2120.88s)]
*  I have obligations due to me. And guess what? Jason, to your important statements historically [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2126.64s)]
*  about the importance of democracies, ultimately, the members of that democracy are going to say, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2134.48s)]
*  this is a benefit that the majority are owed. And that's going to pull things out. I think [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2140.96s)]
*  the only stopgap, I'll just say one thing, the only stopgap in the next decade is going to be [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2145.76s)]
*  significantly higher tax rates in the United States. I don't see how you're going to fulfill [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2150.88s)]
*  the tension gap that's underway right now with respect to where productivity is going and where [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2156.32s)]
*  capital markets are going and where the demands are on the system from people requiring additional [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2160.5600000000004s)]
*  capital to come out to them without taxing assets away from the asset holders. So this would be [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2165.76s)]
*  corporations and high net worth people. And I think that's why you see this Biden proposal. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2172.24s)]
*  We may not like it, but at the end of the day, it's going to be the only way to create a stopgap [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2176.72s)]
*  that's going to avoid massive inflation in the near term. Hold on one second. Let me just say, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2180.8799999999997s)]
*  the only other way besides a massive long-term tax regime to fill the hole would be some [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2187.9199999999996s)]
*  extraordinary productivity gain. And this is where we can all have a hope and a dream and an [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2197.6s)]
*  investment and an effort around technology. AI, automation, people think that their threats are [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2201.28s)]
*  just a job. Energy. But if you can get energy down below three cents a kilowatt hour and you [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2206.8s)]
*  can scale its production by tenfold, if you can automate a lot of labor, if you can get AI to do [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2212.4s)]
*  a lot of stuff that we do today, productivity will go through the roof. The economy will grow [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2217.76s)]
*  fast enough to get out of the debt bubble and meet all of these liability obligations. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2221.84s)]
*  So there are three ways just to summarize. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2225.36s)]
*  To me, that's the long term. The medium term is going to be this tax stopgap, this very high tax [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2228.48s)]
*  stopgap. And then the short term is going to be all the shenanigans that we're talking about. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2234.0s)]
*  Okay. I'll go to you in a second, Sachs. So just to recap, there is actually a third way, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2237.2799999999997s)]
*  too. There are three ways productivity, as you very astutely point out, and we just highlighted [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2241.2s)]
*  some of the ways productivity could help, whether it's energy, AI, et cetera. The second is, of [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2245.68s)]
*  course, increasing taxation on the people who are at the top of the pile would be the likely [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2252.72s)]
*  solution. The third is also austerity, cutting spending in some way. But let me also propose [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2257.3599999999997s)]
*  one thing here. As we look forward to what do people want out of a bank? And how should startups [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2262.7999999999997s)]
*  or just individuals deal with bank runs and their trust in banks to Trimot's point? I've been, I was [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2269.68s)]
*  thinking about this over the weekend, and then this discussion that we would have based on a lot [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2275.04s)]
*  of things you said, Sachs, which was people just deposited their money, and they don't have the [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2278.64s)]
*  ability to assess if a bank is solvent, because the FDIC can't do it. And it's their full time job, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2282.8799999999997s)]
*  it's their mandate to make sure these banks are solvent. So how is a consumer going to be able [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2289.3599999999997s)]
*  to do that? Or even a startup founder, or even a sophisticated investor, like Ackman, or any of us, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2293.44s)]
*  if we're in fact, sophisticated. So let me pause for a second here and pause it something. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2298.48s)]
*  We don't want a bank, we want a bank vault. Consumers do not want their deposits to be used [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2303.2s)]
*  for shenanigans. Just like many people would rather pay for a social network than have their [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2311.68s)]
*  privacy data sold. So I think we should bifurcate banks into bank vaults, and banks, banks can do [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2317.9199999999996s)]
*  what they want with your deposits, you get free checking. But what I want in a bank, what I want [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2325.3599999999997s)]
*  my startups to use, what I want my venture firm to use is I want to pay the bank for services. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2329.44s)]
*  Whether it's 10 basis points, 25 basis points, $500 a month, I would rather see my startups pay [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2334.96s)]
*  $1,000 a month in banking fees, $2,000 a month on banking fees for $2 million, whatever it is, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2341.44s)]
*  and pay for each check, pay for wires, pay for white glove service, whatever they choose, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2348.08s)]
*  but not allow the banks to take that money and loan it out or do things with it. I just want to [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2352.8s)]
*  vault. And I think a vault service is what the majority of consumers want. And given what we're [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2357.52s)]
*  seeing with two insane bank run bailouts in our lifetimes as adults, for those of us who are in [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2363.12s)]
*  Gen X, 2008 and now, we would rather pay for services. And I leave it to you, Sax, is this [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2369.04s)]
*  a potential solution? Because I don't hear anybody saying, give me a bank vault. And why does that [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2374.88s)]
*  service not exist in the world? Yeah, look, what people really want are they want a service provider [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2379.68s)]
*  who gives them the ability to make payments, which if you're a small business is payroll and [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2385.12s)]
*  payables, things like that. They want a money market fund to basically earn interest. And they [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2389.6s)]
*  want all that to be safe. I mean, it's very simple. The idea that when you go open a checking account [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2397.44s)]
*  at a bank, that you are making an unsecured loan to that bank, that is not something that any consumer [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2403.68s)]
*  or small business understands. That whole model, I think, is completely obsolete and outdated. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2410.72s)]
*  And what I heard so many people say, and I think this is not sincere, I think it's just because they [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2415.6s)]
*  hate tech, is that depositors should take it on the chin. Because somehow they made a stupid decision [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2420.48s)]
*  when they opened a checking account. It's like, are you kidding me? Listen, what do you want the [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2427.8399999999997s)]
*  process to be? You want consumers and small businesses when they open a bank account to have [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2431.8399999999997s)]
*  to review the financial statements of that bank, try to figure out all their disclosures, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2437.04s)]
*  where their assets are, whether they have toxic assets on the books. And if they don't do a good [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2441.84s)]
*  enough job doing that, if they're not smart enough to do that, then you want them to be disciplined. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2446.4s)]
*  This is the word that I kept heard being used is we need to discipline the depositors. The depositors [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2451.52s)]
*  are not in a position to evaluate the balance sheet of these banks. That's what the feds are [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2457.68s)]
*  supposed to do. That's what the regulators are supposed to do. That's what Moody's is supposed [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2463.76s)]
*  to do. You're telling me that a bank that had an A rating from Moody's the week before, and had an [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2466.96s)]
*  FDIC seal of approval, that somehow they got it wrong, and the feds got it wrong, but the customer [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2472.0800000000004s)]
*  is supposed to get it right? I mean, come on, that's ridiculous. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2478.32s)]
*  Aaron Norris In related news, Chamath, I would like an airbag in my cars to protect my family. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2480.6400000000003s)]
*  But I don't want to evaluate the airbag technology and unpack it and make sure that it's got the right [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2485.92s)]
*  CO2 carcass in it. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2492.0s)]
*  Chamath Let me finish the point. It's about consumer protection here. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2493.52s)]
*  I don't care who the depositor is. If the banking system is going down because the feds haven't done [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2498.08s)]
*  their job, I mean, pal, two days before the bank failures was testifying that he didn't see stress [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2503.12s)]
*  in the banking system. So either he was lying or asleep at the wheel. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2508.8s)]
*  Aaron Norris Like I said, the feds had given the seal of approval to SVB and all these other banks. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2512.32s)]
*  They had all passed the regulatory exams. And so to now put it on the depositor when the fed screws [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2517.68s)]
*  up and the regulators screw up, and Washington screws up by printing all this money and creating [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2523.6s)]
*  this inflation that we've had, again, out of all the six parties that you could blame, I just think [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2529.04s)]
*  it's the least culpable. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2534.3199999999997s)]
*  Aaron Norris Chamath, should there be a service that provides no interest, but is just a custodian [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2535.7599999999998s)]
*  of money that is absolutely protected? Where is the bank vault product in the world? Does it exist? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2542.32s)]
*  Because I can't seem to find it. Some people seem to say I think Freeburg, you alluded to this maybe [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2548.0s)]
*  in the group chat, that if you have a brokerage account, that's kind of similar to what I'm saying, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2551.52s)]
*  but it doesn't have it. I don't want any interest. I don't need any interest for putting this money [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2556.0s)]
*  in the bank for a startup. They're not in the business of making one to 5% and optimizing for [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2560.88s)]
*  that. I have founders who are now sending me five page memos. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2565.6800000000003s)]
*  If the bank can't use your money, they're going to charge you. So remember... [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2569.52s)]
*  I want to be charged. That's the service I want. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2575.2s)]
*  But I think this is an important point. A bank is a service provider. They spend a lot of money [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2577.44s)]
*  building technology, having people that work there, providing service and infrastructure. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2582.0s)]
*  So for the services that they're offering, if you're not going to let them use your money to [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2585.84s)]
*  make investments with your money and they can participate on that gain... [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2590.0s)]
*  They have to charge you. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2593.04s)]
*  They charge you. And I think that's really where... [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2594.32s)]
*  I want that. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2595.7599999999998s)]
*  But Freeberg, you're not a service provider under the current laws. You understand how it works now [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2596.8s)]
*  is that what we're being told is that when you went to the bank thinking you were just getting [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2601.04s)]
*  a service provider and frankly, largely a commodity service provider... [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2605.92s)]
*  You're getting a fund manager. You're getting an asset manager. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2609.1200000000003s)]
*  Yes. And you're being told that you actually made a risky investment decision. Think about that. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2611.6000000000004s)]
*  When you opened a checking account, you weren't just trying to, again, use a vendor. You were [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2616.4s)]
*  actually making a risky investment decision. That's what they're trying to say. And you [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2621.52s)]
*  deserve to lose your money if you chose poorly, even though nobody else could figure it out. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2624.64s)]
*  None of the experts could figure it out. None of the regulators could figure it out. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2629.84s)]
*  You should talk about the challenges of your system to someone who lives in Argentina. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2631.92s)]
*  It's far worse in other parts of the world. And we've come a long way in the last 100 years. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2636.0s)]
*  We talked about 500 or 600 bank failures on average per year in the 1920s. So I'm not saying [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2639.36s)]
*  that, hey, that's not the case, but there's always been to some degree risk when people [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2644.24s)]
*  are giving their capital over to someone else. And we've certainly made huge strides in progress. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2647.68s)]
*  But I think, Jake, out to your point, there is a point of privilege now that people are saying, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2652.32s)]
*  I want to have a position where I know that my money is not going to get used, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2656.8s)]
*  not going to get moved, going to be completely safe. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2659.92s)]
*  And what would you pay for that? What's the price, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2662.48s)]
*  Freiburg? What would you pay for that? Because right now we're basically giving [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2664.88s)]
*  every crypto entrepreneur at Zealot, basically the high ground because they could make this product. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2668.0s)]
*  I would pay 10 basis points, literally $10,000 a year per million. Is that right? Yeah. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2673.92s)]
*  Remember when you thought Jeff Bezos was going to be president? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2678.7200000000003s)]
*  I still think it's a distinct possibility. Anyway, what would you pay for this product? [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2682.0s)]
*  Chamath or like Bloomberg or Bezos? I don't want to speculate on [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2686.64s)]
*  new products. It's kind of a dumb tangent. I think the thing that you're bringing up though is [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2692.72s)]
*  dumb tangent. Okay. Why doesn't a product like this exist? And I think that it was very well [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2697.2799999999997s)]
*  explained. It's that every for profit business is in the business of making money. And there are [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2704.48s)]
*  physical costs that you have to bear. In the case of a bank, there is physical infrastructure, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2710.16s)]
*  literally bricks and mortar that go into making the branches. There are lots of people. There is [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2715.2s)]
*  lots of software. There's lots of complex back office and middle office things that banks have [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2720.64s)]
*  to do in order to accept money that has a cost. So I don't see how it will be very easy for somebody [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2725.2s)]
*  to create a bank that just stores your money for you without you being charged quite a lot of money. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2732.8799999999997s)]
*  Unfortunately, I think that there has to be a different way to solve this problem. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2739.92s)]
*  And I think that what we did after the great financial crisis was the regulators wrote down [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2745.36s)]
*  all kinds of new rules. But the crazy thing in 2008, where those rules were written on paper, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2751.52s)]
*  and now we're in 2023, and these rules can be written in software. And so I think what it [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2759.28s)]
*  requires is some amount of tactical real time intelligence that regulators need to have over [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2766.0s)]
*  those that they regulate. And I don't know why we're so afraid of demanding that the next time [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2774.72s)]
*  some of these complicated real time laws are written in law that they also need to get written [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2780.24s)]
*  in code. And I think that that's a practical solution. It should be the case that every bank [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2786.8s)]
*  that's supervised by the Fed has a dashboard that has all of the key levers that allows what you [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2792.96s)]
*  said Jason to happen, which is a real time mark to market. Should those or should those be just [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2799.44s)]
*  or should they not be disclosed to shareholders? That's a different discussion. But the regulators [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2804.08s)]
*  should have 100% transparency into how these organizations run because as SAC said, they are [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2808.64s)]
*  an enormously critical institution that at best case after this fiasco, what we've realized is [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2814.8s)]
*  very poorly misunderstood by consumers. And that at the worst case is being mismarketed to us. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2820.96s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that shouldn't be allowed. We're also missing the other side of the balance [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2828.64s)]
*  sheet. We haven't talked about it at all. But banks play a really critical and important role [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2832.96s)]
*  as lenders. Banks act as the channel for lending capital to small businesses for lending capital [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2837.68s)]
*  to individuals to buy homes. It's the primary place where capital is provided to help fuel [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2844.0s)]
*  economic growth and prosperity, particularly in the United States where we have such a liquid, [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2850.8s)]
*  fluid and available mortgage market to support home buying in America. And the absence of, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2856.0800000000004s)]
*  you know, Jason, what you're talking about, having the ability to use deposits to make loans [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2862.0s)]
*  and have what banks have fundamentally been in this country for over 100 years, which is taking [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2868.0s)]
*  short term deposits to make long term loans and making sure that there's some degree of balance [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2872.2400000000002s)]
*  and availability of liquidity to support transactions. And ultimately, mortgage [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2876.48s)]
*  securities came out of the need to generate more liquidity by banks to support depositors. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2880.0s)]
*  And obviously, there was all these inflationary things that happened in that market and bubbles [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2884.88s)]
*  that happened. But it's an important role that banks play. And the lending aspect of banks, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2888.2400000000002s)]
*  if it gets stifled too much, because we swing too far the other way, it can actually have a really [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2892.64s)]
*  adverse effect on economic growth and prosperity and the ability for people to afford homes in this [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2897.2s)]
*  country. So that's the other side of the coin on where things can go bad. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2902.0s)]
*  So this is where I find like the the current banking model to be sort of, like weird and [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2905.12s)]
*  maybe obsolete, and definitely not what consumers expect. So for example, if you go to a bank and [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2910.64s)]
*  you put your money in a deposit account, and then they loan it out to make mortgages, do you realize [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2915.7599999999998s)]
*  that you're an investor in those mortgages as the as the depositor? I don't think you do. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2921.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, what they what they what they do is they take those mortgages sacks, they package them up, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2925.44s)]
*  they sell them, and they get an origination fee and they get the money back. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2930.96s)]
*  Right. Not always. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2934.56s)]
*  So they're not taking- [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2935.12s)]
*  They're not always. But maybe they should be. Maybe they should have to. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2935.92s)]
*  B of A, Wells Fargo do not. Exactly. So B of A, Wells Fargo, for example, they do a lot of that. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2938.48s)]
*  But if you look at First Republic, they have a $90 billion loan portfolio on their balance sheet [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2943.6s)]
*  that they've not packaged up and sold. So the packaging and selling of mortgages generated [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2947.52s)]
*  the liquidity that the banks needed. But there's a cost to that. So a lot of banks will try and [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2952.0s)]
*  balance out their loan portfolio where they'll package some of it up and sell it. But when they [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2955.92s)]
*  do that, they take a loss or they pay a fee. Maybe they should be required to do that. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2959.84s)]
*  Yeah, that might be. Because I mean, look, to the point about [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2963.2000000000003s)]
*  mark to market assets, it's very hard to mark an asset to market unless it's liquid and publicly [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2965.92s)]
*  traded. Let me give you an economic point. I think that there's about $7 trillion in deposits in [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2971.84s)]
*  banks. So if what you guys are saying happened, you're basically sucking $7 trillion out of the [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2975.6800000000003s)]
*  system that's being used to fuel purchasing in the form of loans. And you're taking that set or call [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2980.6400000000003s)]
*  it a 10% discount to that. So about call it $6 trillion. And you're saying we got to go find a [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2986.16s)]
*  market for $6 trillion of loans. And then we're going to have $6 trillion of cash sitting in a [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2991.12s)]
*  bank account doing nothing. And that that challenge is the way that cash will go into money market [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=2996.7999999999997s)]
*  funds. So in other words, like you package up all those mortgage bonds, you create a mortgage bond [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3001.2799999999997s)]
*  security. And then if consumers if depositors want that product, they'll just buy it. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3005.04s)]
*  Yeah, but what is the money market? It ends up being the same thing where money is [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3012.48s)]
*  you earn interest on cash that's being used to make investments elsewhere. So ultimately, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3016.16s)]
*  if you want to earn interest on your cash, it has to be loaned out somewhere to someone. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3020.56s)]
*  I understand. But what I'm saying is, look, I'm just brainstorming here. I don't, you know, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3024.48s)]
*  I don't have the answer. Spitballing. Yes, exactly. I'm not saying this is what should be done. I'm [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3028.48s)]
*  just kind of asking whether it might make more sense. What if on the depositors side, all of [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3033.12s)]
*  the things you put your money in our money market funds, and then when the bank goes out and does [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3037.84s)]
*  its lending business, it does ultimately at some point have to package those up and they get turned [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3041.76s)]
*  into securities, you know, sexy, but money market funds. You know where that cash goes. When you [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3046.2400000000002s)]
*  invest in a money market fund, you're, you're giving money to someone who's using it to make [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3052.48s)]
*  a loan. Like it is also I understand. But then the deposit would never be marked to market as [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3056.6400000000003s)]
*  sexist point deposit would never be a risk. It would never be a risk of bank failure. I just want [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3061.2000000000003s)]
*  to give you're shifting the risk equation to the fund manager, the money market instead of the [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3064.7200000000003s)]
*  manager of the bank and at the end of the day, that just the owner of that security, that money [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3068.4s)]
*  market fund that would take the hit. Okay, just as we wrap up, because I'm going to talk on some [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3074.1600000000003s)]
*  other issues as well. There's two things that are super tangible that founders can do right now are [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3079.44s)]
*  people who want to mitigate against these kinds of issues. There's something called ICS, insured [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3084.2400000000002s)]
*  cash sweeps. These are accounts that automatically, you know, will put your money into multiple FDI [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3091.12s)]
*  insured institutions, 250k at a time, we talked about this previously. There's a bunch of folks [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3097.28s)]
*  doing that in FinTech. I won't give any of them free plugs here, but you can just go look and [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3103.28s)]
*  search for ICS. There is also maybe some thought here that the FDIC 250k limit, maybe that's [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3108.32s)]
*  outdated, certainly for businesses, it is so maybe that should double or triple. And obviously, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3115.1200000000003s)]
*  that cost would be spread out. And then finally, you can go to treasury direct.gov right now and [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3119.28s)]
*  buy short term government debt. And I literally have startups doing this who have major treasuries. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3123.92s)]
*  They're going there and buying short duration stuff themselves, holding it themselves. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3128.2400000000002s)]
*  So they don't have to worry. This is part of this provided by the government is my understanding and [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3132.7200000000003s)]
*  people are buying direct from the government. I personally am not a fan of startups buying [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3138.88s)]
*  t bills because of the duration mismatch problem. They always underestimate when they're going to [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3145.28s)]
*  need their cash. And so I don't like tying up cash. This is if you had a giant treasury. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3150.64s)]
*  I see this all the time. Whenever they try to say when startups try to create laddered bond [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3160.0s)]
*  portfolios, they end up needing the money sooner than they thought. What I'd much rather see startup [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3164.16s)]
*  do is buy 100% US t bill backed money market fund run by the absolute biggest of the big [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3168.48s)]
*  financial institutions, because you can get in and out of it at any time you want and without [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3176.96s)]
*  paying a fee. And that's so much better than trying to manage your own bond portfolio. Let a [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3181.44s)]
*  professional fund manager do it. Well, there are people who do provide these kind of bond ladders. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3185.2s)]
*  I'm just telling you what practice advice symbol through like brokerage account, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3189.84s)]
*  sure, or multiple ones, right. And but now this is I think speaks to Chamath. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3195.84s)]
*  The fact that we have startup founders and people having to measure manage a treasury [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3201.52s)]
*  this granularly is this a failure? Or is this what should be happening? Should we have to have [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3208.48s)]
*  treasuries in the 10 million or $20 million range? Be this granularly managed? Or should this just be [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3213.7599999999998s)]
*  FDIC rates, you know, should be just 10x? Well, in the absence of regular regulatory [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3222.48s)]
*  changes that protect this money, you need to have a financially sophisticated actor on the board. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3228.3999999999996s)]
*  And again, I go back to that should be your venture capitalists. And that person should not have [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3234.72s)]
*  conflicts of interest with the banks that they direct you to. I mean, I don't think that that's [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3241.2799999999997s)]
*  a very controversial statement. Yeah, it's just not happening. And I am just flabbergasted that [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3245.7599999999998s)]
*  people are not even doing the basic blocking and tackling here of having three or four accounts, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3252.64s)]
*  I've always had three or four banking relationships always had it split up. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3257.44s)]
*  Should we move on to some of the other pressing issues? There was a really interesting Founders [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3260.8s)]
*  Fund story about them breaking their latest fund in half. And then there is Stripe closing their [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3265.44s)]
*  funding, which one would you gentlemen like to go to or a different story on the docket? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3271.44s)]
*  I think there are there are four things that are very interrelated. Okay, in startup land. So [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3274.96s)]
*  Founders Fund took their just to make the math simple, because I'm going to get the numbers not [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3281.04s)]
*  exactly right, but like a $2 billion fund that they're going to break into two $1 billion funds. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3285.76s)]
*  I think that's one story $1.8 billion fund, they're going to break it into two $900 million funds, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3290.48s)]
*  it's their eighth fund, it's being cut in half, and it'll become eight and nine. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3295.44s)]
*  I think what that speaks to is valuations, and the marks that we think we have for existing companies [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3298.88s)]
*  and the future value that smart investors like this see all roads lead to it says we're in for [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3306.48s)]
*  a slog. And so trying to put a $2 billion fund to work doesn't seem to make a lot of economic [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3313.68s)]
*  sense to some of the smartest people in the room. So that's that's that. The second thing is there. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3319.3599999999997s)]
*  It's according to Axios. Peter Thiel led this charge and he is the contrarian's contrarian. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3323.7599999999998s)]
*  He was the one according to Axios that led that cut of the fund size with summit Founders Fund, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3330.3999999999996s)]
*  according to the reports, I'll say the more important thing, which in Peter and I are the [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3335.52s)]
*  same, we're the largest LPs in our funds. And so, you know, as the largest LPs in our funds, [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3340.32s)]
*  I think this is a no brainer decision. Number two, stripe basically takes a 50% haircut, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3344.8s)]
*  which is the single best run, most highly valued company in Silicon Valley. Again, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3351.44s)]
*  that's going to eviscerate the company, a lot of TVPI and a lot of people's portfolios, a lot of [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3357.28s)]
*  theoretical money that LPs were going to get. I think the third thing is there's a person that [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3364.64s)]
*  went and filed a FOIA request that UC Berkeley to get Sequoia's returns. And it turns out that the [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3373.12s)]
*  best investor in the game, quote unquote, since 2018 has not really done that well. And I think in [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3382.16s)]
*  the University of California invested over $800 million in Sequoia since 2018. And I think has [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3390.8s)]
*  returned what some 40 million bucks on that number. And then the fourth, which just came out today is [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3396.48s)]
*  that Tiger wrote down the value of their private book by 33% for 2022. And so you know, I think [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3402.6400000000003s)]
*  Tigers AUM basically has gone from 100 billion to 50 billion in a year. There's one more note to add [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3411.76s)]
*  to that YC basically let go of their growth team this week, Y Combinator, for people didn't know [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3417.12s)]
*  what was called the continuity fund, they were doing late stage investing, and that got cut, [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3422.96s)]
*  which is a signal and the 17 employees are gone now. And Gary Tan, I think is making the right [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3428.64s)]
*  decision, you know, they have to focus on what they're great at, which is the earliest stage [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3433.8399999999997s)]
*  of the company. And they had conflicts with this one. This is the most interesting thing [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3437.12s)]
*  for me in the following way. I think the Y Combinator unicorn hit rate is 6%. Right? So [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3442.72s)]
*  every 100 companies that come out of YC, which costs only about $10 million to seed, right, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3449.44s)]
*  six of them become worth a billion dollars or more, and obviously some become worth much, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3455.12s)]
*  much more. And so if you see how difficult it is, even for a growth fund that's attached [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3459.76s)]
*  to that funnel to be successful and make money, because obviously if this thing was ton in cash, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3466.8s)]
*  you would not have cut it, I don't think anybody would do that. So I think it was a very challenging [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3473.1200000000003s)]
*  strategy at a challenging moment in time. And so I applaud these guys for having the discipline to [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3477.84s)]
*  do it. But if you take them all in totality, it is a complicated place in venture capital and startup [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3482.48s)]
*  land. Holy mackerel, like it's a reset, a it's tough to make money, be a lot of folks may not know [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3488.0800000000004s)]
*  exactly what they're doing. See a bunch of valuations are totally wrong. And D, we're [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3493.44s)]
*  going to have to start doing the cleanup work now of resetting all of it, which just takes years, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3499.76s)]
*  as you guys remember in 2000. It took us five years to fix this. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3504.64s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell Yeah, it's a hard reset. Sax, what do you, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3508.88s)]
*  when you look at these in totality, what would you say? [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3511.68s)]
*  Sax Well, I agree with what Chamath just said. I mean, it is going to be a hard period with a lot [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3513.92s)]
*  of resets, a lot of restructuring, a lot of cap tables, there's a lot of mess to clean up. All of [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3517.52s)]
*  that being said, I think I'd rather be an investor today than an investor two years ago, or one year [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3521.84s)]
*  ago, because at least the valuations have corrected to some degree. And then also, we have this really [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3529.1200000000003s)]
*  interesting AI wave happening now. And there's a lot of opportunities to invest in that new, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3535.92s)]
*  you know, cycle. So at least there's like an interesting product cycle. It's getting me excited [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3542.1600000000003s)]
*  to go to work and see these new demos from all these different companies. Whereas, you know, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3546.96s)]
*  you go back a year or two and just the product innovation doesn't seem as world changing as [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3551.2s)]
*  it does now. So I think that as bad as things are, my guess is that the new vintages of VC [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3555.68s)]
*  are going to be better than, you know, call it 2021 for sure. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3564.16s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell That's not going to be a high bar. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3567.3599999999997s)]
*  Sax It's not a high bar, but still. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3570.24s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell That's the thing, but actually Chamath, this is the contradiction. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3572.48s)]
*  Sax This is the contradiction is that it felt better to be a VC in 2021. But in hindsight, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3576.08s)]
*  we know that the vintage is going to be not good. Whereas today, hold on, but today it feels not [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3583.6s)]
*  great to be a VC. But I think the vintage will be a lot better. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3589.68s)]
*  Sax But anybody would tell you that at some point, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3592.7999999999997s)]
*  you're going to have to divorce yourself from emotion to be a reasonably good investor over [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3595.6s)]
*  long periods of time. How many data points do we need to realize that too many people [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3599.68s)]
*  were put into this game that may not have known what they were doing? [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3604.7999999999997s)]
*  And we're going to have to go and work through all of those excesses. And I think it's just [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3608.7999999999997s)]
*  going to take a lot of time. US limited partners are in a really difficult spot. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3613.68s)]
*  European investors, I think, are probably in a pretty difficult spot. There are a couple of [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3619.68s)]
*  bright, bright points around the world of folks that are still optimistic and doing well. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3625.04s)]
*  I think Middle East is one, Southeast Asia is another. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3629.36s)]
*  But other than those, it's just a whole group of folks that just have to get completely [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3634.3199999999997s)]
*  re underwritten from first principles. Even when you have an incredible platform like Sequoia, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3638.72s)]
*  five years of no returns on $800 billion for somebody like UC Berkeley. What it really means [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3644.56s)]
*  without commenting on Sequoia's performance is that UC Berkeley is effectively out of business [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3650.56s)]
*  in being a limited partner for the foreseeable future. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3655.44s)]
*  Well, and I think that has that has implications. So even if you think these vintages are great, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3658.4s)]
*  I don't think they're open for business. And frankly, if even if they wanted to be open [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3663.7599999999998s)]
*  for business, how do you go to an IC? When they look at all of the totality of those dollars that [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3668.16s)]
*  have not made anything, how do you justify the next 800 billion? I just think it's very hard. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3673.68s)]
*  While I agree that LPs are out of it, I think the story was garbage because it all funds go [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3678.32s)]
*  through a J curve. And they're literally talking about the majority of the funds in that vintage. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3683.44s)]
*  2008 2019 2020 21. They're all in literally the definition of the j curve, the third, fourth, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3687.84s)]
*  fifth year, one of the most important things you need to be able to do is measure how long does it [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3693.2s)]
*  take the delta t to 90% of calling committed capital? And how long does it take the delta t [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3698.16s)]
*  to return one x DPI? I can tell you Jason, if you're a reasonably good fund, those numbers [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3705.28s)]
*  should be between five and seven years for both, which none of those funds have hit the average [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3710.64s)]
*  for a normal venture fund is around five to seven years to call 90% of the capital. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3716.24s)]
*  And around five to seven years to return one x DPI. I'm just telling you that's what the average [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3724.96s)]
*  is. And if you talk to firms, so all I'm saying is there was a period of time where in the absence [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3729.68s)]
*  of getting money back again, this is not a Sequoia thing. It just means that there was an entire [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3735.84s)]
*  cohort and years of capital allocation that is not necessarily in a j curve. It's impaired. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3741.92s)]
*  Because if after five years, you if after five years, you return nothing. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3748.48s)]
*  Sometimes you just have to see the writing on the wall. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3753.36s)]
*  Sax explain the j curve one more time for folks. And then what is your analysis of that Sequoia [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3755.28s)]
*  story? Well, the j curve, the theory behind it is that when you start deploying a new fund, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3760.64s)]
*  you're drawing fees down to pay for the firm and the investments you've made have not been [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3766.4s)]
*  marked up yet. So the value of the fund is actually going down because some of it's getting [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3769.76s)]
*  eaten up in fees. And you haven't really had a chance for any of those investments to be [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3774.5600000000004s)]
*  successful. And then what happens early, right? I don't even know about that. I just think it's [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3778.6400000000003s)]
*  they haven't had a chance to get marked up. But then what happens is you start getting markups. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3784.0800000000004s)]
*  And now at least on paper, the value of the fund goes up. And then hopefully, those markups [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3787.2000000000003s)]
*  eventually turn into distributions or DPI like Jamatha is talking about. Yeah, we have a vintage [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3792.2400000000002s)]
*  2017 2018 fund that's actually fully returned at this point. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3798.08s)]
*  You exited some secondaries or acquisitions? No, we just had some we just had some exits. But look, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3802.1600000000003s)]
*  I think that is a little bit on the early, early slash lucky side. But we haven't really seen much [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3807.04s)]
*  of the J because, you know, you should be getting markups within two years, I think on your [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3812.4s)]
*  investments, if the companies are looking good, at least historically, that was the case. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3818.6400000000003s)]
*  Freeberg, any any thoughts on this collection of stories with venture, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3822.32s)]
*  basically having the great venture reset? The end of the super cycle, the beginning of the next. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3826.7200000000003s)]
*  It's happening. Okay, we're in the thick of it. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3833.76s)]
*  But by the way, I would just I would just go back to the point that with all the problems [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3836.48s)]
*  from office is talking about the reset and the wipeout that needs to occur, I think this is still [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3839.36s)]
*  I think that's part of what makes this a better time to be an investor. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3845.36s)]
*  This is what I'll say about that, Sachs, I think I agree with you. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3850.48s)]
*  I disconnect asset values and asset prices from fundamental business value being created. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3855.44s)]
*  So the market did stuff up prices went up. That doesn't really mean that businesses aren't [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3863.04s)]
*  fundamentally good that there aren't amazing technology businesses being built today that [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3868.96s)]
*  are going to affect billions of lives tomorrow. If you are tracking a public company stock, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3873.2s)]
*  and you like the business, you spend time with management, you see what they're building, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3881.2799999999997s)]
*  you see their revenues growing, their profits are growing, they're making great products, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3885.12s)]
*  people are happy with what they're doing. But the stock's really expensive, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3888.08s)]
*  you don't want to buy the stock. Suddenly, the stock drops by 80%. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3892.0s)]
*  Nothing about the business has changed. It's just that the market is paying less to own [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3896.16s)]
*  shares in that company. That's a great time to buy that stock. I think that's the moment [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3899.84s)]
*  we're in in Silicon Valley, everyone's like, Oh my god, it's over. Things are terrible. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3904.48s)]
*  Just because the asset prices of the shares in companies has gone down, [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3909.28s)]
*  does not mean that the quality of the businesses has changed, or that there isn't fundamental [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3914.4s)]
*  value being created in Silicon Valley. In fact, the contrary point to Sachs's comment is that it [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3919.04s)]
*  is a great time to be buying these shares. It is a great time to be investing. It is a great time [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3925.84s)]
*  because as we've talked about countless times, there are extraordinary technologies from AI [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3931.28s)]
*  to biotech becoming software, to fusion, to novel applications with AI and SaaS, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3936.7200000000003s)]
*  and on and on and on. Many of the amazing things we've talked about that I think can and will [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3943.04s)]
*  affect many industries and billions of lives are being built today, and they're not going to stop [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3946.56s)]
*  being built. And you can now buy the stock at 80% off. So, you know, if you're investing today, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3950.72s)]
*  and if you're a builder today, as long as the capital keeps flowing to support the building [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3956.64s)]
*  work, which I think to some degree it will, because there's still enough of it sitting there, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3960.9599999999996s)]
*  you're not going to have a lot of these crazy growthy rounds with high prices and all the [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3964.9599999999996s)]
*  nonsense that went on the last couple years. But there's certainly a lot of opportunity to [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3968.08s)]
*  greet real business value. And right now an opportunity to buy shares pretty cheap, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3971.7599999999998s)]
*  and participate meaningfully in that value creation. I'll tell you the thing I'm seeing [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3976.56s)]
*  on the field and like playing the game on the field is something we've been talking about for [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3979.84s)]
*  the last year. We started a program called founder dot university, and it's basically like a 12 week [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3983.2000000000003s)]
*  course on like how to build your MVP. We had 350 people join the last one. What's the discount [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3988.32s)]
*  code people can use to- There's no discount code. It's free for founders basically. It's free for [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3992.48s)]
*  founders if they come to the 12 weeks. But anyway, what I did was- Go to WWW. No, it's founder dot [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=3997.52s)]
*  university because it's an extension. But in the words of Sachs, let me finish. Please let me finish. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4003.12s)]
*  What we did was we just said anybody who gets to an MVP and it's two or three builder co founders, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4012.96s)]
*  we'll give them a 25k check. And I did 20 or 30 of these 25k checks in the last couple of months [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4017.6s)]
*  of just the founders right now, who have been laid off by other companies. They're dogged, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4024.08s)]
*  pragmatic, absolutely customer centric, product centric founders. Whereas the last five years [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4029.6s)]
*  have been filled with theatrics and white papers and ICOs and just nonsense and absurd valuations [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4036.24s)]
*  and people wanting credit for work not done. And now people are actually building MVPs and they're [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4042.4s)]
*  dogged, product driven founders, customer centric, mission driven founders. And it feels to me- [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4048.16s)]
*  That first part is so well said. People wanted all this credit for work, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4053.2799999999997s)]
*  not done. And for progress not achieved. That game is over. Finished. Finished. Which means if [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4059.28s)]
*  you are a product led CEO, and you're a mission driven CEO who actually built something, you stand [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4066.5600000000004s)]
*  out so much in this ecosystem. And I have people begging for money sending me long emails and [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4071.44s)]
*  decks and total addressable market. I'm just like, can you just build a product and show me that you [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4076.96s)]
*  can actually deliver a product. And then we'll start the process of the rewards based system [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4080.96s)]
*  here. You know, the reward based system in Silicon Valley is so magical when it works. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4087.12s)]
*  You get money from Founder University or, you know, Techstars or Y Combinator, then go to a seed [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4092.96s)]
*  fund, then go to a series A fund. That milestone based funding was so broken. And now it's back. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4098.24s)]
*  And it's so functional when it's working. It's just a magic of Silicon Valley is when people work and [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4104.64s)]
*  get rewards, work and get rewards. And it just creates this great pace and dynamic that I'm glad [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4109.36s)]
*  to see. Just as we wrap here, everybody's been begging for a science corner enough about the [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4114.16s)]
*  chaos in the world. Everybody wants the Sultan of science to tell us and educate us about something. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4120.5599999999995s)]
*  And sax needs to use the loo anyway. So let's do a science corner here. Room temperature, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4128.0s)]
*  superconductors, you sent me a link, I read the abstract of this paper. And I don't know which [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4134.4s)]
*  language I need to put this into Google Translate, but I couldn't understand any of it. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4140.72s)]
*  So please, I literally read the abstract and I was like, I couldn't get through the first two [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4144.8s)]
*  sentences without having to start doing searches. I'll start with just like the simple explainer [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4148.88s)]
*  on superconductors. You know, materials that conduct electricity are called conductors. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4154.160000000001s)]
*  So conductors, electrons move through them like a copper wire. That's how electricity flows. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4161.6s)]
*  And all conductors have some amount of resistance, meaning not all the electrons kind of flow through [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4166.96s)]
*  at a perfect rate. They bump into the atoms in the material in the wire and they generate heat. You [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4173.28s)]
*  know, you've ever felt a wire while electricity is flowing through it gets hot, right? So that's [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4179.04s)]
*  because the conductor has some resistance, which means the electrons bump into the walls of the [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4182.72s)]
*  atoms in the material, they generate heat and you lose electricity, you lose energy, you lose power. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4187.12s)]
*  And so in 1911, it was discovered when Mercury was reduced to a very, very cold temperature, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4193.2s)]
*  that there was a point at which the material conducted electricity with absolutely no resistance. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4200.639999999999s)]
*  So the electrons flowed through the material, completely unbounding, you know, not bouncing [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4208.16s)]
*  into the material, not generating any heat. And having no resistance mean you're losing no power [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4214.719999999999s)]
*  in transmission of that electricity. But a number of other super interesting effects occur. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4219.92s)]
*  Number one is that magnetic fields now reflect off of that metal perfectly. So if you put a magnet, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4224.64s)]
*  you ever seen that image of it? And Nick, we could probably pull one up in the YouTube video, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4231.28s)]
*  we put a magnet on top of a superconductor, it actually floats. Because the magnetic field [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4234.4800000000005s)]
*  like the north and the north push against each other and it floats up. So superconducting [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4239.52s)]
*  materials kind of became this fascination in the early 20th century, that oh my God, if we can [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4244.08s)]
*  actually make materials that superconduct, there are all these amazing benefits. One of the benefits [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4249.2s)]
*  is you could have no loss in electricity being transmitted. Today, 15% of power is lost in the [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4254.0s)]
*  transmission from the power station to your home. You could also do interesting things like create [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4258.88s)]
*  maglev or frictionless trains that float, you know, like magnets floating off the ground on top of a [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4263.12s)]
*  superconducting track. And by having no friction, you could push the track the train once, and you [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4268.8s)]
*  wouldn't need to use any energy to move it along. So you could have basically powerless transportation. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4274.32s)]
*  You could have really powerful new microprocessors. So a superconductor microprocessor, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4279.36s)]
*  instead of a traditional semiconductor microprocessor, would use just 1% of the energy [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4286.96s)]
*  of a semiconductor microprocessor. Think about that. All the AI stuff we're talking about, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4292.8s)]
*  all the chips that we're talking about, dropping the energy needs by 99% if those chips were made [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4296.8s)]
*  from a superconducting material. And one of the more interesting applications of superconducting [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4302.16s)]
*  materials could be infinite battery storage. So you could take a superconductor, turn it into a [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4305.68s)]
*  coil, and the electricity would just flow through it infinitely because it would never turn into [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4309.84s)]
*  heat. And then when you're ready for that power, you just plug in and you get the power out. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4313.92s)]
*  The actual loss of energy in a superconductor battery, less than 5%. And that's compared with, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4317.52s)]
*  you know, significantly more energy loss used in chemical systems. And you wouldn't need to kind [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4323.360000000001s)]
*  of get all the materials that we're struggling to get now to generate batteries. So the idea of [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4327.12s)]
*  generating superconductors in industrial scale has always been super interesting. Today, the way [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4331.2s)]
*  that we generate superconducting materials is we have to make a material super, super cold. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4336.16s)]
*  In 1987, a physicist named Chu developed one of the first ceramic superconductors where they [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4341.12s)]
*  discovered a new way of generating superconductivity. It wasn't just taking a metal and cooling it down [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4347.28s)]
*  very, very cold because when you get it very, very cold, the atoms stop moving and the electrons [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4352.72s)]
*  inside pair up and it's called Cooper pairing and they flow through. And he said we could actually [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4357.52s)]
*  do this with a hotter temperature. And he demonstrated this in a ceramic, yttrium barium [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4361.6s)]
*  copper oxide, super confusing name. But basically, he took a bunch of materials and baked them in an [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4366.4800000000005s)]
*  oven. And they turn into this really interesting material that became superconducting. And then the [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4370.64s)]
*  race was on because what he did is he made a superconductor that could superconduct at the [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4374.56s)]
*  temperature of liquid nitrogen. And liquid nitrogen is really cheap. So we can just use it. And that's [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4378.64s)]
*  actually how all MRI machines run today, is you have superconductors that reflect the magnetic [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4383.040000000001s)]
*  fields in the super in the MRI machine and they're using liquid nitrogen to stay cool. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4387.28s)]
*  And so there's a lot of industrial applications today that use superconducting materials using [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4391.679999999999s)]
*  liquid nitrogen. But in order for us to do all the stuff I mentioned like maglev trains and [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4395.759999999999s)]
*  infinite battery storage and superconducting microprocessors, we have to get superconductors. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4400.4s)]
*  We have to discover a material that can superconduct at room temperature so that we can sit with it in a [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4406.32s)]
*  computer on our desktop or we can have it run on a railroad track, or we can put it in our backyard [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4413.04s)]
*  to store energy. And there's been this race and there's all these different classes of materials [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4419.04s)]
*  that physicists and material scientists have spent decades trying to figure out what can [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4424.0s)]
*  superconduct at room temperature. We started with metals, copper, and we tried carbon nanotubes and [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4428.8s)]
*  fullerene tubes. We had all these different ceramics like I talked about. And there have been [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4433.68s)]
*  literally tens of thousands of ceramics that people bake in ovens and try and see how [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4439.44s)]
*  superconducting they are. Basically you take the material and you cool the temperature and you [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4444.24s)]
*  measure the resistance and as soon as it hits superconductivity, boom, there's this magic moment [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4448.639999999999s)]
*  where it drops to zero and it becomes superconducting and there's this big changeover effect. So everyone's [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4453.839999999999s)]
*  trying to find that temperature which it can happen at room temperature. And people have found [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4459.2s)]
*  superconductivity on the surface of DNA and organic molecules but you can't scale that. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4463.44s)]
*  People have found superconductivity on all these weird kind of material on the surface of things [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4468.8s)]
*  but no one's ever been able to industrialize it. In 2015 there was a new kind of material called [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4473.76s)]
*  a hydride which is basically taking a thin metal and putting it in hydrogen gas and kind of baking [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4478.400000000001s)]
*  it for a couple of days and the hydrogen sticks to the metal and then you would use this hydride [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4485.12s)]
*  as a new kind of conductor. And hydrides it turned out had really good superconducting potential. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4490.24s)]
*  They would superconduct at room temperature but they needed super high pressure so you'd actually [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4496.48s)]
*  have to leave them in something that's hundreds of times the pressure of the atmosphere. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4502.32s)]
*  And so that's not really technically and industrially feasible either. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4506.639999999999s)]
*  So this guy named Ranga Diaz published a paper a couple of weeks ago that got a ton of press [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4510.32s)]
*  and a ton of controversy. And basically he said, look I've got this new hydride and I've got this [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4516.879999999999s)]
*  really weird metal that no one ever talks about and I've baked it with hydrogen gas and this [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4523.28s)]
*  hydride can actually superconduct at room temperature and at only one gigapascal which is still [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4529.92s)]
*  greater pressure than room temperature but it basically starts to show on the chart of are we [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4535.84s)]
*  getting there? Can we actually get there? That maybe we are. And so this paper was published in [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4540.32s)]
*  Nature a couple of weeks ago and it got a ton of coverage because everyone's like, oh my gosh, [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4544.88s)]
*  the problem is this particular individual, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4551.28s)]
*  you know the lead researcher Ranga Diaz on the paper, he's pretty controversial because he made [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4556.0s)]
*  a room temperature superconducting claim back in 2020 in a paper he published in Nature. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4562.4s)]
*  And after he made that claim a lot of scientists tried to replicate what he did and they were not [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4567.679999999999s)]
*  able to. And then the journal retracted his paper and he had a method that he took data noise out of [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4572.639999999999s)]
*  the measurement system he was using and the way that he took the data noise out people said [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4579.68s)]
*  actually skewed the results and made it look like it was superconducting when maybe it wasn't. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4583.52s)]
*  And he actually had a talk that he did that was published on YouTube a year later where he said [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4587.76s)]
*  he raised 20 million dollars from Sam Altman and Daniel Ek and a bunch of other investors [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4593.280000000001s)]
*  and it turns out that also wasn't true and then he came back and said, well I didn't actually [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4597.200000000001s)]
*  raise the money, I was talking with them about raising the money. So this guy's kind of a sketchy [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4600.16s)]
*  character in the space but the temperature at which he was able to generate or claims to have [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4604.32s)]
*  generated and he did get peer review and did get published, a superconductor is at room temperature, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4610.16s)]
*  it's at slightly high pressure but if it's real and it does get repeated it's one of the next [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4616.88s)]
*  steps that we're almost going to be getting to this point of true room temperature superconducting [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4623.2s)]
*  materials and then this whole industry will blow up. Transmission lines, battery storage, [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4627.44s)]
*  maglev trains, superconducting microprocessors, many new industries can and will emerge from this [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4632.72s)]
*  material discovery if it's proven to be real. So it's a super interesting storyline, a lot of people [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4639.6s)]
*  in the material science world and scientists, chemists, physicists are kind of going crazy [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4645.360000000001s)]
*  about this and there was a survey done by Quantum Magazine and half the scientists were like, this [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4649.68s)]
*  is bullshit and the other half was like, this is going to change the world. So we don't really know [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4655.68s)]
*  yet where this is all going to settle out but I thought it was worth kind of talking about [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4659.52s)]
*  and bringing it up because if room temperature superconductivity is really realized in the next [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4662.88s)]
*  decade, it's another one of these kind of black swan technology discoveries that none of us are [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4667.6s)]
*  thinking about right now but it totally transforms all these markets and very quickly kind of [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4671.92s)]
*  increases like we were talking about earlier. Productivity makes renewable energy super, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4677.040000000001s)]
*  super cheap, makes computing power 99% less power intensive, AI chips will explode using [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4681.040000000001s)]
*  this technology. So a lot of super interesting applications if room temperature superconductivity [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4686.88s)]
*  comes to light, super interesting story I thought we should share it and talk about. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4691.12s)]
*  Yeah, Chamath, I would love to get your insights on it and then Sax, I would like to understand [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4694.72s)]
*  how many emails and what you order from Uber Eats during that segment. Go ahead, Chamath. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4699.4400000000005s)]
*  Venkat Viswanathan, who runs a battery group at Carnegie Mellon, introduced me to Ranga two years [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4703.28s)]
*  ago. Me and my partner Jay, we were like, holy shit, this is outrageous and we tried to spin it out [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4709.04s)]
*  into a natural company. But the University of Rochester blocked it. And so we've been following [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4715.28s)]
*  this guy for two years and all the trials and tribulations, but it's a really, really exciting [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4722.719999999999s)]
*  thing if it does come to you got capital blocked, explain why you would get capital blocked in a [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4728.0s)]
*  situation like that. Why wouldn't they allow you to spin it up? It is interesting because like [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4732.5599999999995s)]
*  typically universities have a tech transfer office and you can do these deals pretty cleanly. So you [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4736.5599999999995s)]
*  know, when you go to Stanford, the tech transfer office is quite sophisticated at MIT, it's quite [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4741.76s)]
*  sophisticated. There are these pretty standardized deals and, and royalty percentages. What is the [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4745.599999999999s)]
*  standard deal? Explain to the audience how a tech transfer deal would work? And how does the [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4750.48s)]
*  university make money from it? If you're a prof and you invent something, or even if you're a student, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4754.48s)]
*  it's technically owned by the school. And so if you want to commercialize it, you go to them and [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4759.12s)]
*  you basically say, here's a capital partner of mine, and we want to go and start a company around [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4764.0s)]
*  it. And what they will normally say is, okay, great, give us a piece of equity and give us [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4768.32s)]
*  some royalty in some cases, depending on what it is, especially the equity tends to be in the mid [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4773.599999999999s)]
*  single digit percentages, the royalties tend to be in the mid single digit percentages, it depends [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4778.799999999999s)]
*  on how, yeah, call it five, five, six, 7%. But it can be a lot when you think about a, you know, [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4783.2s)]
*  a school like Stanford, who's spinning out hundreds of these things a year. But if you're, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4789.36s)]
*  if you're a school that doesn't historically do a lot of tech transfer or has a lot of [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4795.68s)]
*  cutting edge R&D, you wouldn't have that team. And so Rochester didn't necessarily have it. Now [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4800.72s)]
*  look, Runga is probably getting bombarded by 30 other people who'll pay 10 times more than what [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4807.360000000001s)]
*  I was trying to pay 18 months ago. It's a really interesting thing. And I think there'll be some [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4811.200000000001s)]
*  there'll be some there's anybody know what the top tech transfers of all time were? Like was Google [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4814.56s)]
*  a tech transfer? Freeburg? Do you know? Like, because PageRank was out of the what it's never [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4820.96s)]
*  know? Yeah, Larry and Larry and Sergey gave Stanford, I think, one of the Stanford. Yeah, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4826.16s)]
*  they gave him a percent. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, that's unknown. Yeah, because because back rub was written [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4829.919999999999s)]
*  while Larry was a PhD there. So technically, they, you know, they had some part of it. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4836.719999999999s)]
*  Carnegie Mellon ranked as top tech transfer university. I'm just seeing here in terms of [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4841.599999999999s)]
*  the rankings, University of Florida, Columbia, Stanford, Harvard, it varies so much. Some of [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4845.44s)]
*  them are terrible, like, and some of them are cronyism. So like you go to some of the universities [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4850.72s)]
*  and the tech transfer offices have deep relationships with certain VCs and investors that they'll only [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4855.92s)]
*  work with. And they always get first picks and first dibs. And they're super tight with them. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4860.400000000001s)]
*  They don't run a real market process. And then some tech transfer offices just give away the [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4864.72s)]
*  farm for nothing. And then some tech transfer offices think that they own it and they should [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4869.52s)]
*  get paid 60% royalties for the thing. It's all over the map. And some of them are sophisticated, [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4873.2s)]
*  and some of them are not. So it's actually quite surprising, J Cal, how different all the [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4878.48s)]
*  universities are in terms of their level of sophistication and the types of deals they'll do. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4885.28s)]
*  But I will say this work in superconducting research, it's another good example going up to [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4890.0s)]
*  going back to the point a couple episodes ago about the importance of fundamental research and [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4894.5599999999995s)]
*  the importance of, you know, the support from academic institutions and governments and other [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4899.12s)]
*  aspects when you're still not sure what the technology is, that to do that fundamental [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4906.08s)]
*  discovery work, I think is a good collective social benefit. And then to industrialize it [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4911.12s)]
*  and commercialize it requires, I think, a market based approach, which is you take that capability, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4915.84s)]
*  try and build a business, find customers, make money. And that's really how you get it to be [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4920.24s)]
*  funded to be scaled. Because you're never going to you shouldn't have to put, you know, government [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4923.84s)]
*  and academic money behind that sort of effort. But private market participants should. And so, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4927.52s)]
*  you know, it's interesting. I mean, I think I'm not holding my breath. I've been, you know, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4932.8s)]
*  I did a science project in 1993 when I was probably 12 or 13 years old on superconductors. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4937.4400000000005s)]
*  And I got a yttrium barium copper oxide disk. And I got some liquid nitrogen from UCLA and I [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4944.72s)]
*  poured it on the disk and I floated a magnet above it. I had a poster board and a computer presentation [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4950.16s)]
*  back then. And I was super enthralled about the future of superconductors. And exactly what I said [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4954.88s)]
*  today is what I said back in 1993. So, you know, 30 years ago, he was so busy dating, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4958.88s)]
*  I didn't think you had time for superconductor experiments. Yeah, look, I don't think I don't [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4963.52s)]
*  think that this stuff has really, it's been it's been like fusion. It's always been a promise around [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4967.36s)]
*  the corner. Physicists have always had hope we've taken incremental steps towards it. But it's [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4973.2s)]
*  always felt like one of those things where you're always getting 50% closer to the wall. It's like, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4977.04s)]
*  you're never actually reaching the wall. And so, anecdotally, one, yeah, by the way, I will say [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4981.6s)]
*  one area that a lot of people think holds a lot of promise for superconducting research [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4986.72s)]
*  is in quantum computing, because you can actually model on a molecular level what might be going on. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4991.280000000001s)]
*  Right now, the BCS theory is this theory on Cooper pairing that happens in ceramics is the only way [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=4996.400000000001s)]
*  that we really understand how superconducting actually works, why it works, why there's no [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5001.52s)]
*  resistance at certain temperatures for certain types of materials. For most materials, we have [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5005.52s)]
*  no frigging clue why it happens. We don't understand the physics of it. There's something going on on [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5009.52s)]
*  a quantum mechanical level that we just don't get. And so if we can understand it better through [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5013.76s)]
*  quantum modeling using quantum computers, all of a sudden, we may be able to actually start to [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5018.08s)]
*  come up with ideas for molecules and crystal structure that would allow us to make superconducting [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5022.88s)]
*  material that we simply don't have enough time in our lifetime to run all the experiments in a lab [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5027.2s)]
*  today, and we can simulate it. And so that's why quantum computing could play a real role [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5031.68s)]
*  in advancing our ability to do discovery in superconducting materials. And like I talked [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5035.76s)]
*  about, these are like not just one, but like two or three order of magnitude improvements in the [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5039.76s)]
*  efficiency of certain systems of industry on earth today. So it shows how the compounding [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5044.16s)]
*  benefits of technology and things you cannot see around the corner can suddenly cause these [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5048.8s)]
*  explosive growth moments in technology and in industry. I don't know when quantum computing [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5052.88s)]
*  gets here. When it gets here, it might discover superconducting. And then when that gets discovered, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5057.52s)]
*  boom, energy costs drop by 99%. Computing goes up by a hundredfold. So there's these amazing things [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5061.6s)]
*  that are still like in front of us that each one of which could be, you know, really great exponential [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5066.56s)]
*  triggering events. And we're seeing a little milestone today, but yeah, I don't know. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5070.8s)]
*  Sachs reaction. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5075.120000000001s)]
*  Sounds good. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5077.52s)]
*  Sachs, how many moves did you play in your 12 chess games with Peter Chihl? [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5079.68s)]
*  Guys, I got stuff to do. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5085.68s)]
*  Threebrook was talking about superconducting. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5086.72s)]
*  How many points did you go up? [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5088.320000000001s)]
*  All right, look, I got shit to do. Come on, let's go. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5089.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, Sachs. All right, listen, this has been a great episode. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5093.4400000000005s)]
*  You have a comment on the Atlantic article that says Ron DeSantis has peaked already? [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5097.36s)]
*  Where'd you see that? [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5103.28s)]
*  Don't do it. Don't do it. Why you got to troll him? [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5105.5199999999995s)]
*  I didn't see that, but it's in the Atlantic. Oh, you want to know why the Atlantic suddenly [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5108.24s)]
*  has turned on him is because they're the biggest backers of the war. Those guys have all these [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5112.32s)]
*  like neocons over there. And so he gave a statement saying that, you know, our support for Ukraine [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5118.0s)]
*  shouldn't be a blank check and some other comments expressing, let's say, skepticism [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5125.36s)]
*  of what we're doing over there. And that was totally unacceptable to them. So all these [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5130.16s)]
*  neocons are registering disappointment. But I would argue that's a electoral asset, not a liability. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5133.92s)]
*  I have a prediction given what's going on with these banks and what's going on in this [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5139.679999999999s)]
*  kind of a I think we all agree the soft landing concept is over. We're going to be in a recession. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5143.599999999999s)]
*  The war is going to end there because we're not funding this and American, the American public [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5148.639999999999s)]
*  is not going to want to see 10s of billions of dollars going to Ukraine and to fund this war in [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5154.08s)]
*  year two or three hundreds of billions. I'm just saying every month. Yeah, I know the spending run [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5159.5199999999995s)]
*  rate of this war is actually greater than what we did in Afghanistan and Afghanistan ended up being a [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5164.64s)]
*  20 year multi trillion dollar operation that just flushed all that money down the drain. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5170.24s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, we're in a greater run rate than Afghanistan. Yeah. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5175.92s)]
*  Do we know what the monthly run rate is for this? Oh my god, how did they pass back? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5180.4800000000005s)]
*  We've appropriated over 130 billion Chamath and Afghanistan we spent two trillion over 20 years. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5184.4800000000005s)]
*  So there's 100 billion a year run rate. Yeah, this is what a monumental waste of money that was. And [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5190.320000000001s)]
*  now look at the financial crisis we're in. Can you imagine if we could have two trillion back? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5195.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, all these trillions that we just squandered instantly, we would take this all [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5199.84s)]
*  those trillions and trillions, we squandered on stuff that didn't matter. And now we're paying [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5203.4400000000005s)]
*  the price for it. That could be education could be universal health care, it could be paying down [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5207.52s)]
*  the debt. How about paying down the debts of all this inflation? Exactly. Let's think logically [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5211.68s)]
*  here the number one issue for this country in the next election. I am with Friedberg, his great [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5216.160000000001s)]
*  prediction from the year end show is we need a president and we need an administration that is [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5220.400000000001s)]
*  fiscally responsible and controls the balance sheet in a logical fashion like the last two [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5226.240000000001s)]
*  administrations have not seen capable of doing. I am with Friedberg single issue voter balance [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5233.2s)]
*  the budget, get spending under control. austerity measures hashtag. All right, for the Sultan of [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5237.92s)]
*  Science. Sorry, what's that? Can you repeat that? What I wanted to say, Chamath, is there are there [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5243.04s)]
*  any plugs for the remaining part of the episode? Mr. Beast is curing blindness and buying people's [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYwfiqYocc0&t=5248.48s)]
