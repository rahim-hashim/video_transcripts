# E111 Microsoft to invest $10B in OpenAI, generative AI hype, America's over-classification problem
**All In Podcast:** [January 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0)
*  Is anybody else seeing a half a second lag with J Cal like a second line [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=0.0s)]
*  That's that's one two one two from it like the ways mouth moves. Well, that always happens [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4.48s)]
*  Oh god, here it comes [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=9.0s)]
*  Black sacks relaxed sacks [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=11.96s)]
*  Are we going recording [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=15.76s)]
*  A-plus material this is Chappelle at the punchline. Let's go [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=20.28s)]
*  Rain man, David's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=30.76s)]
*  Alright everybody welcome to episode [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=43.36s)]
*  111 of the world's greatest podcasts according to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=47.68s)]
*  Slate the podcast that shall not be mentioned by the press apparently no, what do you mean? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=52.08s)]
*  They just did a profile on us. Well, they did this is the conundrum [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=56.2s)]
*  It's so much of a phenomenon that were the number one business and the number one tech podcast in the world hands down [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=60.84s)]
*  that the press [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  Has a hard time [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=69.12s)]
*  giving us any oxygen because [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=71.28s)]
*  They want to hate us [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=74.4s)]
*  They want to cover it. You're saying they take the ideas but not the they don't want to cite it [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=76.48s)]
*  They don't want to cite it. They don't want to cite it. But anyway, shout out to Slate [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=81.28s)]
*  What I thought was interesting was the guy pointed out that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=85.14s)]
*  We don't want to subject ourselves to independent journalists asking us independent questions [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=87.82s)]
*  Therefore we go direct and that that's kind of the the thing nowadays when everyone says they want to go direct [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=93.02s)]
*  It's because they don't want to be subject to independent journalists. Well, one might ask themselves why [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=98.61999999999999s)]
*  Subjects don't want to go direct. Yeah, exactly. You mean don't want to go to journalists [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=103.58s)]
*  Yeah, because there's a there's a specific reason why principles the subject of stories do not want to have the press [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=107.41999999999999s)]
*  Interpret what they're saying is because they don't feel they're getting a fair shake [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=114.76s)]
*  They feel like the challenge is that then we avoid independent scrutiny of our points of view and our decision [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=117.56s)]
*  We don't they're constantly writing hit pieces about us [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=123.80000000000001s)]
*  The the question is when we want to present our side of it [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  Do we need to go through their filter or not? Why would you go through their filter when it's always gonna be a hit piece? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=130.4s)]
*  right, well, they have a class hatred of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=136.72s)]
*  Basically of technology entrepreneurs and investors [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=141.24s)]
*  You're right Jake how they don't hate you because you genuflect to their political biases you see [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=147.72s)]
*  If you do what SPF did which is basically [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=154.44s)]
*  Agree with all of their biases then yes, they'll treat you better. That's the deal. That's how it works [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  And when you say they specific large media outlets right sex [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=164.32s)]
*  Referring to Fox Walker [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=169.6s)]
*  Okay, you can name one I'll trade you I'll tell you what I'll trade you Fox for [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=172.4s)]
*  MSNBC and CNN and the New York Times the Washington Post and the Atlantic magazine and on and on and on [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  You get a lot of mileage out of being able to name Fox. The fact of the matter is Megan Kelly. Mm-hmm [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=181.95999999999998s)]
*  That's a podcaster. She's independent now. That's true. She's you can name one. I mean literally one outlet [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=187.28s)]
*  That is not part of this, you know mainstream media and they all think the same way [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=193.66s)]
*  There are very small differences in the way they think it's all about clicks [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=199.26000000000002s)]
*  It's all about clicks at this point and it's all about just about journalism and advocacy. It's that comedy [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=202.94s)]
*  You what you're calling advocacy is bias and activism. It's a [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=208.94s)]
*  That's what I'm talking about activism journalism. Yes. I think the Dreymon also highlights a really important point [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=213.78s)]
*  Which is you know, he started his podcast. It's become one of the most popular [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=218.9s)]
*  forms of sports media and he can speak directly without the filtering and you know [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=223.18s)]
*  classification that's done by the you know journalist and [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=229.0s)]
*  It seems to be a really powerful trend the audience really wants to hear direct and they want to hear unfiltered raw [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=232.66000000000003s)]
*  Points of view and there and maybe there's still a role for I think the journalism [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=239.58s)]
*  Separate from that which is to then scrutinize and analyze and question and it's not journalism [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=244.70000000000002s)]
*  Activism they're just activists [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=249.98000000000002s)]
*  There are also journalists out there sex, right? So actually well it depends what the topic is and what the outlet is, right? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=252.9s)]
*  But I actually I would argue that most of these journalists are doing what they're doing for the same reason that we're doing what we're [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=259.14s)]
*  Doing which is they want to have some kind of influence because they don't get paid very much, right? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=265.98s)]
*  But the way they have influence is to push a specific political agenda. I mean, they're activists. They're basically [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=271.02s)]
*  Advocacy journalism. Yes, that's the term I coined for it. It's advocacy. Did you guys see this brouhaha? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=277.7s)]
*  where Matt Eglisius wrote this article about the Fed and about the debt ceiling and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=283.02s)]
*  through this whole [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=289.53999999999996s)]
*  multi-hundred word thousand word [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=291.14s)]
*  Home [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  He didn't understand the difference between a percentage point and a basis point and then you calculate the interest [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=295.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I did see that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=301.9s)]
*  Wow, so wait a second you're saying the feds raising 25% [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=304.14s)]
*  That's a huge difference between [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=310.02s)]
*  25% between a principal and an outside analyst right like a principal has a better grasp typically of the topics and the material [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=312.34s)]
*  But you know the argument I think the argument [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=319.62s)]
*  Within the journalist circle he's considered the conventional wisdom [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=324.17999999999995s)]
*  I get it [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=327.38s)]
*  But the argument from a journalist is that by having that direct access that person is also biased [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=327.7s)]
*  Because they're an agent because they're a player on the field [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=333.34000000000003s)]
*  They do have a point of view and they do have a direction they want to take things [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=335.86s)]
*  So it is a fair commentary that journalists can theoretically play a role [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=338.82s)]
*  Which is they're an off-field analyst and that don't necessarily bring I would argue [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=343.42s)]
*  They're less educated and more biased than we are that may or may not be true what the two of you guys are debating [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=347.82s)]
*  Which is a very subjective take but the thing that is categorical and you can't deny is that there is zero checks and balances [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=353.26s)]
*  When [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=360.54s)]
*  Something as simple as the basis point percentage point difference isn't caught in proofreading [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=361.58000000000004s)]
*  Isn't caught by any editor isn't caught by the people that you know help them review this and so what that says is [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=367.42s)]
*  All kinds of trash must get through because there's no way [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=373.70000000000005s)]
*  For the average person on Twitter to police all of this nonsensical content [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=377.22s)]
*  This one was easy because it was so numerically illiterate that it just stood out [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=382.26s)]
*  But can you imagine the the number of unforeseen errors [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=386.7s)]
*  Journalists make today in their search for clicks that don't get caught out that may actually tip somebody to think a [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=391.46s)]
*  Versus B. That's I think the thing that's kind of undeniable, right? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=398.09999999999997s)]
*  There's a very simple test for this if you read [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=404.58s)]
*  The journalists writing about a topic you are an expert on whatever the topic happens to be [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=408.21999999999997s)]
*  You start to understand okay. Well on that story I'm reading [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=413.76s)]
*  That they understand about 10 or 20 or 30 percent of what's going on [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  But then when you read stories that you're not involved in, you know, you read a story about Hollywood or I don't know pick an industry [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=423.36s)]
*  Or a region you're not super aware of you're like, okay [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=429.04s)]
*  Well, that must be a hundred percent correct and the truth is journalists have access to there's a name for that one [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=431.76s)]
*  There is a name for it. Yeah, it's called the gel man amnesia effect [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=437.1s)]
*  You just yeah, it's Michael Crichton who came up with that. Yeah, so you yeah, no, he's exactly right [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=439.68s)]
*  but I think it's worse than that it's because the now the [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=445.74s)]
*  Now the mistakes aren't being driven just by sloppiness or laziness or just a lack of expertise [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=448.88s)]
*  I think it's being driven by an agenda [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=454.5s)]
*  So just to give you an example on the slate thing the slate article actually wasn't bad [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=456.97999999999996s)]
*  It kind of made us seem, you know cool [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=460.68s)]
*  The sub headline was a close listen to all in the infuriating fascinating safe space for Silicon Valley's money men [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=463.04s)]
*  Okay, but the headline changed so I don't know if you guys noticed this the headline now is [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=469.64s)]
*  Elon Musk inner circle is telling us exactly what it thinks first of all like the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=475.92s)]
*  So they're trying way too hard to like describe us in terms of Elon [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=482.08s)]
*  Which you know is maybe two episodes out of 110 [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=486.0s)]
*  But before inner circle the word they use was cronies and then somebody edited it because I saw [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=489.32000000000005s)]
*  cronies in like one of those tweet, you know [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=495.56s)]
*  summaries [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=499.68s)]
*  Mm-hmm, you know where like it does a capsule or whatever. Yeah, and those get frozen in time [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=500.64000000000004s)]
*  So, you know, they were trying to bash us even harder and then somebody took another look at it [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=506.24s)]
*  Well, here's what happened the I'll tell you what happens in the editorial process [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=510.40000000000003s)]
*  Whoever writes the article the article gets submitted. Maybe it gets edited proofread whatever [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=513.84s)]
*  Maybe it doesn't even in some publications. They don't have the time for it because they're in a race [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=518.64s)]
*  Then they pick there's somebody who's really good at social media [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=522.92s)]
*  They picked six or seven headlines [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=526.0s)]
*  They a B test them and they even have software for this where they will run a test [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=527.6s)]
*  Sometimes they'll do a pay test. They put five dollars in ads on social media, whichever one performs the best [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=532.3199999999999s)]
*  That's the one they go with so it's even more cynical and because people who read the headlines [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=538.76s)]
*  Sometimes they don't read the story right? Obviously most people see the headline they interpret that as a story [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=544.8s)]
*  That's why I told you when they did that New Republic piece on you with that horrific [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=549.0s)]
*  monstrous monstrosity of an illustration [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=553.52s)]
*  Don't worry about it people just read the headline they know you're important nobody reads the story anyway [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=557.28s)]
*  But it wasn't a bad article actually it was well written actually I was in shock [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=562.4399999999999s)]
*  I was like who was this writer that actually took the time to write some prose that was actually decent [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=566.42s)]
*  Yeah, he had listened to a lot of episodes clearly that was a really good moment actually that was great advice because you gave it [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=571.04s)]
*  To him and you gave it to me because both of us had these things and Jason said the same thing [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=576.4s)]
*  Just look at the picture and if you're okay with the picture just move on [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=580.48s)]
*  My picture was terrible [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=587.92s)]
*  Yeah, but it's close to reality [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=590.0s)]
*  Was Peter teal yeah, but that just shows how ridiculously biased it is right [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=599.4s)]
*  Hugh Grant [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=607.8s)]
*  Elon let's pull that up one more time here. Elon looks like Hugh Grant. I just kind of he does [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=609.0s)]
*  He's kind of not bad kind of looks like Hugh Grant and like Notting Hill [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=613.16s)]
*  I knew that article was gonna be fine when the first [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=616.92s)]
*  You know item they presented as evidence of me doing something wrong was basically helping to ask chase a Boudin [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=621.12s)]
*  Which was something that was supported by like 70% of San Francisco [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=627.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, which is a 90% Democratic city. So not exactly evidence of some, you know, I think I'm going movement. Look at the headline [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=631.92s)]
*  The quiet political rise of David Sacks so convice profit of urban do I'm just letting you know [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=640.0799999999999s)]
*  People don't get past the six word in the image. Yeah, it's 99% of people like oh my god Congrats on the you know, Republic article [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=645.56s)]
*  It could have little bit Laurel. What do they call them? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=652.76s)]
*  Laurel ipsum, you know, like it could have just been filler words from their second graph down and nobody would know. Yeah [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=655.4s)]
*  But now apparently if you notice that San Francisco streets look like, you know walking dead that apparently you're a prophet of urban [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=661.68s)]
*  Do I mean people are so out of touch? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=670.0s)]
*  I mean they can't even acknowledge what people can see with their own eyes. That's the bias that's gotten crazy [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=672.2s)]
*  And I don't know if you guys saw this [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=677.36s)]
*  really horrible [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=680.24s)]
*  dystopian video of the art gallery owner who's been dealing with [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=682.0400000000001s)]
*  Owning a storefront in San Francisco, which is challenging and having to clean up [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=686.1600000000001s)]
*  Feces and you know trash and whatever [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=691.2800000000001s)]
*  every day and [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=694.5200000000001s)]
*  I guess the guy snapped and he's hosing down a homeless person who refuses to leave the front of his store [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=696.04s)]
*  Oh, I saw that I saw that just like the humanity in this is just insane like [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=702.92s)]
*  Really like you're hosing a human being down [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=709.44s)]
*  It's terrible who is obviously [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=712.72s)]
*  Not living a great life and as you know, I can feel I'm Jake Al I can feel for both them [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=715.56s)]
*  I agree that it's not good to hose a human being down on the other hand think about the sense of frustration that [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=720.84s)]
*  storeowner has because [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=725.84s)]
*  He's watching his business go in the toilet because he's got homeless people living in front of him [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=727.48s)]
*  So they're both like being mistreated the homeless [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=732.42s)]
*  Same all about the store owner say more the homeless person being mistreated the store owners being mistreated by the city of San Francisco. Yeah [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=736.72s)]
*  Say my personal person is not in a privileged position [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=744.56s)]
*  That person probably the store owner the store owner. He's probably fighting to stay in business [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=747.4s)]
*  I'm just saying I'm not saying that's right, but [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=752.64s)]
*  What you're trying to do is oh my god, look at this this homeless person being horribly oppressed [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=762.12s)]
*  Oh that store owner is a victim too [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=766.56s)]
*  Yeah, there's no doubt. It's [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=769.1999999999999s)]
*  Business what is that person supposed to do? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=772.0799999999999s)]
*  No, wait, this is this is symbolic of the breaking down of basic society [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=774.0799999999999s)]
*  Like these both of these people are obviously like it's just a horrible moment to even witness is like [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=778.4s)]
*  Oh, it's like it's something Jason. Do you have equal empathy for the store owner and the homeless person or no? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=785.92s)]
*  Under no circumstances should you hose a person down in the face who is homeless? I guess just horrific to watch [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=793.7199999999999s)]
*  It's just inhumane. This is a human being now, but as a person who owns a store [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=799.64s)]
*  Yeah [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=803.9s)]
*  My dad grew up in the local business if people were abusing the store [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=804.36s)]
*  You're trying to make a living and you got a cleanup, you know, whatever [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=806.96s)]
*  excrement every day [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=811.5200000000001s)]
*  Yes [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=813.6s)]
*  Yeah in that moment the empathy is not equal [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=815.72s)]
*  I think you have more empathy obviously for the person on the receiving end of that hose [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=818.44s)]
*  Okay, but in general our society has tons of empathy for homeless people [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=822.96s)]
*  We spend billions of dollars trying to solve that problem [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=828.6800000000001s)]
*  You never hear a thing about the store owners who are going out of business so on a societal level [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=831.36s)]
*  You know not in that moment [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=837.76s)]
*  But in general the lack of empathy is for these middle-class store owners [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=839.32s)]
*  Who may not be middle-class working class who are struggling to stay afloat and you look at something like what is it like a quarter? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=844.08s)]
*  Or a third of the storefronts in San Francisco are now vacant [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=851.8000000000001s)]
*  The [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=854.86s)]
*  Shocking thing is like this person is running an art gallery storefront in San Francisco [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=857.86s)]
*  Like why would you even bother? Why would you bother to have a storefront in San Francisco? I mean everybody's left [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=862.38s)]
*  It's just what do you mean? Why do you bother if you've so open to stores? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=867.08s)]
*  So what are you supposed to start to code all of a sudden? Well, no [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=870.1s)]
*  I mean you would shut it down at some point and find an exit and do like [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=873.34s)]
*  Large fixed costs, right? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=877.34s)]
*  Many ten years ago exactly at some point you have to shut down your store in San Francisco the second you can get out [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=880.34s)]
*  The solution to everything J Cal isn't go to coding school online and then you know, I didn't say I'm just [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=886.22s)]
*  But moving to another city is a possibility true a lot of folks in Silicon Valley [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=891.5400000000001s)]
*  I think in this weirdly fucked up way do believe the solution to everything is learn to code [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=895.86s)]
*  Or become an uber driver or pretty [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=900.62s)]
*  Suisse [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=903.5s)]
*  The guy spent years building his retail business [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=907.22s)]
*  I mean the thing is a homeless person camps in front and the homeless and he calls the police the police don't come and move [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=909.88s)]
*  The homeless person the homeless person stays there. Yes nicely to move customers are uncomfortable going in the stores result [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=915.02s)]
*  Yeah [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=919.94s)]
*  I stopped going to certain stores in my neighborhood because of homeless [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=920.1s)]
*  Tents being literally fixated in front of the store and I go to the store down the road [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=922.9s)]
*  To get my groceries or whatever like I mean, it's not a kind of uncommon situation for a lot of these small business owners [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=926.7s)]
*  They don't own the real estate. They're paying rent [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=932.18s)]
*  They've got high labor costs, you know, everything's inflating generally city populations declining. It's a brutal situation [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=934.8599999999999s)]
*  All around I think if everybody learns to code or drives an uber [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=942.14s)]
*  The problem is that in the absence of things like local stores and small businesses you hollow out communities [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=946.54s)]
*  You have these random detached places where you kind of live and then you sit in your house [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=953.6999999999999s)]
*  Which becomes a prison while you order food from an app every day [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=958.6600000000001s)]
*  I don't think that is the society that people want so I don't know [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=962.12s)]
*  I kind of want small businesses to exist and [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=965.38s)]
*  I think that the homeless person should be taken care of but the small business person should have the best chance of trying to [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=968.14s)]
*  Be successful because it's hard enough as it is the the mortality rate of the of the small business owner is already 90% [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=973.5400000000001s)]
*  It's impossible in San Francisco, let's just be honest [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=981.74s)]
*  Genuflecting Jay Cal [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=985.1s)]
*  Listen, you are because here's how am I general affecting? I'm saying the guy I'm just shocked that the guy even has a storefront [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=987.34s)]
*  I would have left a long time ago a tweet [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=993.4200000000001s)]
*  That's a moment in time and you're not showing the ten steps that led up to it [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=995.26s)]
*  Oh a thousand steps of five times. He called the police [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=999.4s)]
*  Stopian the lost customers the stuff that freeberg and Jamal through just talking about [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1003.46s)]
*  Physical conflict that we didn't see in that, you know, and he's resolving it [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1008.38s)]
*  It's really hard to look at these videos and know what's going on it's awful to see but man we don't know [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1012.7s)]
*  It's all and actually you want to know another reason why we can't solve this problem [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1017.34s)]
*  This is the language we use around it. The fundamental problem here is not homeless. Okay addiction. It's addiction [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1021.26s)]
*  You see this and it's mental illness Schellenberger's done the work [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1026.5800000000002s)]
*  It's like he said 99% of the people he talks to it's either mental illness or addiction [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1029.7s)]
*  But we keep using this word homeless to describe the problem [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1034.3400000000001s)]
*  But the issue here is not the lack of of housing although that's a separate problem in California [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1037.9s)]
*  But it's basically the lack of treatment totally so we should be calling them treatment lists and mandates around this because an enforcement you [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1043.1000000000001s)]
*  Can't have a super drug be available for a nominal price and give people [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1051.9s)]
*  You know a bunch of money to come here and take it and not enforce it. You have to draw the line. That's at fentanyl [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1058.1000000000001s)]
*  Sorry fentanyl is a super drug this three alternatives is mandated rehab [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1063.5s)]
*  mandated mental health or jail or [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1069.0600000000002s)]
*  You know housing services if you're not breaking the law [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1072.8400000000001s)]
*  You don't have mental unless you don't have drug addiction and then provide those are the four paths of outcome here of success [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1076.0400000000002s)]
*  And if all four of those paths were both mandated and available in abundance, this could be a ten attractable problem [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1080.9s)]
*  Unfortunately the man the mandate I mean you guys remember that Kevin Bacon movie where Kevin Bacon was locked up in a mental institution [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1088.82s)]
*  But he wasn't like [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1095.98s)]
*  He wasn't mentally ill. It's a famous story. It's a famous. It's what's that? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1097.82s)]
*  Someone's probably gonna call me an idiot for [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1105.1799999999998s)]
*  For messing this whole thing up, but I think there's a there's a story where [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1108.4199999999998s)]
*  Mandated [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1114.3s)]
*  Mental health services like locking people up to take care of them when they have mental mental health issues like this [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1116.46s)]
*  became kind of inhumane and [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1123.26s)]
*  A lot of the institutions were shut down and a lot of the laws were overturned and there are many of these cases that happened [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1125.58s)]
*  Where they came across as like torturous to what happened to people that weren't mentally ill and so the idea was like let's just [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1131.4199999999998s)]
*  Nest you think about what? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1138.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's another one right and [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1140.78s)]
*  It's unfortunate but I think that there's some you know, we talk a lot about nuance in gray areas [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1142.82s)]
*  But there's certainly some solution here that isn't black or white [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1146.98s)]
*  It's not about not having mandated mental health services and it's not about locking everyone up that has some slight problem [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1150.12s)]
*  But there's some solution here that needs to be crafted [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1156.3s)]
*  where you know, you don't let people suffer and you don't let people suffer both as the [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1159.28s)]
*  The victim on the street, but also talking about a 5150 I think like when people are held [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1164.12s)]
*  They're a danger to themselves or others kind of thing, right? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1170.3000000000002s)]
*  But you have to think about the power of language here if we refer to these people as untreated persons instead of homeless persons [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1173.38s)]
*  And that was the coverage 24-7 in the media's this is an untreated person the whole policy prescription [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1180.3400000000001s)]
*  We completely different it realized there's a shortage of [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1186.78s)]
*  Treatment we'd realize there's a shortage of remedies related to getting people in treatment as opposed to building housing [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1189.26s)]
*  But why why and laws that mandate it that don't enable it because if you don't mandate it [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1196.5400000000002s)]
*  Then you enable the free reign and the free living on the street and the open drug markets and all this sort of stuff [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1202.18s)]
*  It is a really easy test for this if it was if it was yourself and you were addicted [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1207.74s)]
*  Or if it was a loved one where your media family members [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1213.7800000000002s)]
*  Would you want yourself or somebody else to be picked up off the street and held with a 5150 or whatever? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1216.7s)]
*  Code [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1223.02s)]
*  Involuntarily against their will because they were a danger. Would you want them to be allowed to remain on the street? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1224.3000000000002s)]
*  Would you want yourself if you were in that dire straits and the answer of course is you would want somebody [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1229.78s)]
*  Policy perspective on this Jake house. So let me ask you as our our diehard liberal on this show. No, I'm not a diehard liberal [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1236.46s)]
*  No, no, he's an independent only votes for Democrats. Please get it right 75 percent of time. I voted Democrat 25 [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1241.94s)]
*  Independent votes for Democrats. Okay, 25 percent Republicans [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1248.7s)]
*  Is it not that your individual liberties are infringed upon if you were to be picked up and put away? [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1251.78s)]
*  You know my position on it is if you're not thinking straight [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1256.86s)]
*  You're in your high on fentanyl. You're not thinking for yourself and you you could lose the liberty for a small period of time [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1260.26s)]
*  72 hours a week, you know, especially if you're a danger to somebody [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1266.94s)]
*  You know yourself or other people and in this case if you're on fentanyl if you're on meth, you're you're you're a danger [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1271.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, I think if more I think if you sell people had that if more people had that point of view and had [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1277.18s)]
*  That debate as sax is saying in a more open way [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1281.3s)]
*  You could get to some path to resolution on just not in San Francisco. It's not how it happened. So [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1283.8600000000001s)]
*  You guys know this we won't say who it is, but someone in my family [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1289.66s)]
*  you has some pretty severe mental health issues and [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1293.94s)]
*  the problem is [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1296.94s)]
*  Because they're an adult you can't get them to get any form of treatment whatsoever [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1300.06s)]
*  Right, right [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1305.42s)]
*  You only have the nuclear option and the nuclear option is you basically take that person to court and try to seize their power [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1307.38s)]
*  Of attorney which is essentially saying that you know individual liberties are gone [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1313.94s)]
*  yeah, and by the way, it is so unbelievably restrictive what happens if you lose that power of attorney and [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1317.26s)]
*  Somebody else has it over you [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1323.94s)]
*  it's just a huge burden that [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1326.54s)]
*  The legal system makes extremely difficult and the problem was a backstop [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1329.46s)]
*  You know if the person is committing something illegal like camping out or doing fentanyl meth [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1334.22s)]
*  Whatever you can use the law as the backstop [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1339.74s)]
*  You know again, all that person can do is really get arrested [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1341.8999999999999s)]
*  Even that is not a high enough bar to actually get power of attorney over somebody the other thing that I just wanted you [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1345.82s)]
*  guys to know I think you know this but just a little historical context is a [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1351.22s)]
*  Lot of this crisis in mental health started because Reagan defunded all the psychiatric hospitals. He emptied them in California and [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1355.74s)]
*  That compounded because for whatever reason his ideology was that these things should be treated in a different way [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1363.98s)]
*  And when he got to the presidency one of the things that he did was he repealed the mental health [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1369.94s)]
*  I think it's called the mental health systems act and the MHSA [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1375.3799999999999s)]
*  Which completely broke down some pretty landmark legislation on mental health and it's and I don't [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1380.1399999999999s)]
*  Think we've ever really recovered and that we're now 42 years onward from 1980 [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1385.3s)]
*  But or 43 years onward, but just something for you guys to know that that's that's well that breaking had a lot of positives [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1389.54s)]
*  Yeah, but that's one definitely negative check in my book [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1396.1s)]
*  Against his legacy is his stance on mental health in general and what he did to defund mental health [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1399.54s)]
*  Well, let me make two points there [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1404.54s)]
*  So I'm not defending that specific decision [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1406.74s)]
*  There were a bunch of scandals in the 1970s and epitomized by the movie one flew over the cuckoo's nest of Jack Nicholson [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1409.46s)]
*  About the conditions in these mental health homes and that did create a groundswell to change laws around that [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1415.74s)]
*  But I think this idea that like somehow Reagan is to blame when he hasn't been in office for 50 years as opposed to the [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1423.5s)]
*  Politicians who've been in office for the last 20 years. I just think it's letting them off the hook [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1430.94s)]
*  I mean Gavin Newsom 10 15 years ago when he was mayor of San Francisco [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1434.94s)]
*  Declared that he would end homelessness within 10 years. He just made another [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1439.34s)]
*  Declaration like that as governor. So I just feel like but I'm saying it's Reagan's fault [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1444.42s)]
*  I'm just saying this is an interesting historical moment [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1448.98s)]
*  I think it's letting I think it's letting the politics society needs to start thinking about changing priorities [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1452.26s)]
*  We didn't have this problem of massive numbers of people living on the streets 10 15 years ago [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1456.94s)]
*  It was a much smaller problem and I think a lot of it has to do with fentanyl the power of these drugs is increasing [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1462.86s)]
*  Massively, there's other things going on here. So [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1468.82s)]
*  In any event, I mean you can question what Reagan did in light of current conditions [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1472.62s)]
*  But I think this problem really started in the last 10 15 years [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1477.1399999999999s)]
*  It's like in an order of magnitude bigger way [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1480.58s)]
*  These are super drugs until people realize like these are a different class of drugs and they start treating them as such [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1483.56s)]
*  It's gonna just get worse. There's no other path [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1489.3799999999999s)]
*  Oh as far as I know Reagan didn't hand out to these addicts [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1492.1799999999998s)]
*  $800 a week to feed their addictions. They can live on the streets in, Francisco. No, no, no, I is the current policy of the city [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1497.4399999999998s)]
*  I hear you all policy. All I just wanted to just provide was just that color that [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1502.6s)]
*  we had a system of funding for the mental health infrastructure particularly local mental health infrastructure and [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1508.0s)]
*  We took that back and then we never came forward and all I was saying is I'm just telling you we're [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1514.36s)]
*  I think that's part of the solution here is yeah, we're gonna have to basically build up shelters [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1521.4399999999998s)]
*  We're gonna have to build up [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1526.28s)]
*  The problem now for example is Gavin Newsom says a lot of these things and now he's gone from a [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1529.48s)]
*  Massive surplus to a 25 billion dollar deficit overnight [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1536.3999999999999s)]
*  which we talked about even a year ago because that was just the the law of numbers catching up with the state of California and [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1540.02s)]
*  He's not in a position now to do any of this stuff. So this problem may get worse [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1546.96s)]
*  Well, they did they did appropriate I forget the number [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1551.24s)]
*  It's like 10 billion or something out of that, you know huge budget they had to solve the problem of homelessness [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1554.5s)]
*  I would just argue they're not tackling it in the right way because what happened is there's a giant special interest that formed around this problem [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1558.46s)]
*  which is the [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1565.82s)]
*  The building industry who gets these contracts to build the quote, you know affordable housing [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1567.38s)]
*  Ten units at a time on Venice Beach [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1578.98s)]
*  Like the most expensive land you could possibly build because you get these contracts from the government [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1581.4199999999998s)]
*  So there's now a giant special interest in lobby that's formed around this if you really want to solve the problem [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1586.98s)]
*  You wouldn't be building housing on [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1592.78s)]
*  Venice Beach, you'd be going to cheap land just outside the city and you'd be building scale shelters [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1596.1399999999999s)]
*  I mean shelters that can house [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1602.7s)]
*  10,000 people not 10 and you'd be having [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1605.86s)]
*  Yes, yeah treatment built into them right you'd be solving this problem at scale and that's not what they're doing [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1609.54s)]
*  By the way, do you guys want to hear this week in grift? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1616.54s)]
*  Sure, we're all in that's a great example of grift. I I read something today in Bloomberg. That was unbelievable [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1619.9399999999998s)]
*  There's about two trillion dollars of debt owned by the developing world [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1627.06s)]
*  That has been classified by a nonprofit the nature conservancy in this case as [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1632.74s)]
*  Eligible for what they called nature swaps [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1638.24s)]
*  So this is two trillion of the umpteen trillions of debt [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1640.68s)]
*  That's about to get defaulted on by countries like Belize Ecuador [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1643.8400000000001s)]
*  Sri Lanka Seychelles you name it and [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1649.0s)]
*  What happens now are the big bulge bracket Wall Street banks and the nature conservancy? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1652.2s)]
*  Goes to these countries and says listen, you know, you have a billion dollar tranche of debt. That's about to go upside down and [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1658.6000000000001s)]
*  You're gonna be in default with the IMF. We'll let you off the hook and [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1666.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, we will negotiate with those bondholders to give them 50 cents on the dollar [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1671.1200000000001s)]
*  but in return [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1676.72s)]
*  You have to promise to take some of that savings and you know protect the rainforest or protect a coral reef or protect some? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1678.3200000000002s)]
*  mangrove trees all sounds good [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1686.02s)]
*  Except then what these folks do is they take that? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1688.76s)]
*  Repackaged debt they call it ESG [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1692.0s)]
*  They mark it back up and then they sell it to folks like Blackrock who have decided that they must own this in the portfolio [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1695.12s)]
*  So it literally just goes from one sleeve of Blackrock, which is now marked toxic [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1701.96s)]
*  Emerging market debt and then it gets into someone's 401k as ESG debt [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1707.6s)]
*  Is that unbelievable so you convert your signal and buy some ESG to make yourself feel good? Yeah, two trillion [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1713.1599999999999s)]
*  Know about ESG is that Exxon is like the number seven like top-ranked company according to ESG and Tesla is even on the list [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1720.0s)]
*  disastrous [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1728.84s)]
*  Crazy is that it's? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1729.84s)]
*  It's a complete [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1732.48s)]
*  All of those that we said this many times but each of those letters individually means so much and should be worth a lot to a [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1735.04s)]
*  Lot of people but when you stick them together it creates this toxic soup where you can just hide the cheese [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1741.08s)]
*  Yeah, governance is important in companies, of course the environment is important social change is important [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1747.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, but why are these things grouped together in this? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1754.2s)]
*  It just perverts an industry J. Cal. It's an industry of its own. Absolutely. All right speaking of [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1757.2s)]
*  Microsoft is gonna put ten billion dollars or something into chat GPT [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1764.04s)]
*  degenerate AI as I'm calling it now is the hottest thing in Silicon Valley [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1768.64s)]
*  The technology is incredible [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1772.96s)]
*  I mean you you can question the business model maybe but the technology is pretty well [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1774.32s)]
*  I mean, yeah [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1778.4s)]
*  So what I'd say is if we're nine billion dollars for a company that's losing a billion dollars and Azure credits a year [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1778.88s)]
*  That's one way to look at it [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1784.16s)]
*  That's also a nice way to look at a lot of other businesses that ended up being worth a lot down the road [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1785.68s)]
*  I mean sure you can model out the future of a business like this and create a lot of really compelling big outcomes, you know [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1790.64s)]
*  Potentially. Yeah [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1798.8s)]
*  Potentially. Yeah [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1800.48s)]
*  So Microsoft is close to investing 10 million in open AI in a very convoluted transaction that people are trying to understand [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1801.92s)]
*  It turns out that they might wind up owning 59 percent of open AI but get 75 percent of the cash [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1808.88s)]
*  Profits back over time [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1816.08s)]
*  49 49 percent. Yeah of open AI, but they would get paid back the 10 million dollars over some amount of time [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1818.08s)]
*  And this obviously includes Azure credits and [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1825.04s)]
*  Chat GPT as everybody knows this just incredible [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1830.0s)]
*  Demonstration of what AI can do in terms of text based creation of content and answering queries [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1834.8799999999999s)]
*  Is taking the net by storm people are really inspired by it. It's axe [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1842.48s)]
*  Do you think that this is a defensible real technology or do you think this is like a crazy hype cycle? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1846.08s)]
*  Well, it's definitely the next VC hype cycle [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1853.04s)]
*  Everyone's kind of glomming on to this because VC really right now needs a savior [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1855.28s)]
*  Just look at the public markets everything we're investing in us in the toilets [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1859.44s)]
*  So we all really want to believe that this is going to be the next wave [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1862.3999999999999s)]
*  And just because something is a VC hype cycle doesn't mean that it's not true so [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1867.76s)]
*  As I think one of our friends pointed out [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1873.52s)]
*  You know mobile turned out to be very real. I think cloud turned out to be [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1876.32s)]
*  I'd say very real social was sort of real in the sense that did lead to a few big winners [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1881.04s)]
*  On the other hand web 3 [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1886.8s)]
*  And crypto was a hype cycle. It's turned into a big bust vr falls into the hype cycle [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1889.36s)]
*  I think we are probably a hype cycle so far. No one can even explain what web 3 is [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1894.16s)]
*  In terms of AI, I think that if I had to guess I would say [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1899.28s)]
*  The hype is real in terms of the fact that it's a virtual world [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1905.2s)]
*  The hype is real in terms of its [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1908.48s)]
*  Technological potential however, i'm not sure about how much potential there is yet for vcs to participate because right now [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1911.5s)]
*  It seems like this is something that's going to be done by really big companies. So open ai is basically a [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1920.24s)]
*  It looks like kind of a microsoft proxy. You've got google. I'm sure we'll develop it through their deep mind asset [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1927.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, i'm sure facebook is going to do something huge in ai [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1934.24s)]
*  So what I don't know is is this really a platform that starts to be able to benefit from I will say that [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1938.1599999999999s)]
*  some of the companies we've invested in are starting to use these tools, so [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1945.4399999999998s)]
*  I guess I guess where I am is I think the technology is actually exciting [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1950.3999999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't go overboard on the valuations. So I wouldn't buy into that level of the hype but you think there could be hundreds of [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1955.76s)]
*  companies built around [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1963.4399999999998s)]
*  An api for something like chat gbt dolly, maybe yeah, I don't I don't think startups are going to be able to create the ai [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1965.52s)]
*  Themselves, but they might be able to benefit from the apis maybe that's that's the thing [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1972.54s)]
*  That's the thing that has to be proven out free. There's a lot of really fantastic machine learning [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1978.3200000000002s)]
*  Services available through cloud vendors today, right? So azure has been one of these kind of vendors and [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1984.0800000000002s)]
*  Uh, obviously open ai is building tools a little bit further down on the the stack [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1990.8s)]
*  But there's a lot of tooling that can be used for specific vertical applications [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1996.4s)]
*  Obviously the acquisition of insta deep by bio and tech is a really solid example [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=1999.76s)]
*  And most of the big dollars that are flowing in biotech right now are flowing into machine learning applications where there's some vertical [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2004.16s)]
*  application of machine learning tooling and techniques [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2010.78s)]
*  around some specific problem set and the problem set of mimicking human communication and [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2013.68s)]
*  Doing generative media [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2021.68s)]
*  Is a consumer application set that has a whole bunch of really interesting product opportunities [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2023.92s)]
*  But let's not kind of be blind to the fact that nearly every other industry [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2028.64s)]
*  And nearly every other vertical is being transformed today and there's active progress being made [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2033.3600000000001s)]
*  in funding and getting liquidity on companies [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2038.56s)]
*  And progress with actual products being driven by machine learning systems and there's a lot of great examples of this [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2042.24s)]
*  So, you know the fundamental capabilities of large data sets and then using these kind of [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2047.52s)]
*  learning techniques in software and statistical models to make [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2054.16s)]
*  Kind of predictions and drive businesses forward in a way that they're not able to with just human knowledge and human capability alone [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2058.0s)]
*  Is really uh real and it's here today [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2065.92s)]
*  And so I think let's not get caught up in the fact that there's this really interesting [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2069.28s)]
*  Consumer market hype cycle going on where these tools are not being kind of [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2072.64s)]
*  You know validated and generating real value across many other verticals and segments [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2076.9599999999996s)]
*  Chamath when you look at this microsoft open a ideal and you see something that's this [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2081.2s)]
*  Convoluted hard to understand. What does that signal to you? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2086.7s)]
*  As a capital allocator and company builder, I would put deals into two categories [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2090.7999999999997s)]
*  One is easy and straightforward [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2095.2799999999997s)]
*  And then two is you know cute by half or you know the two hard bucket this is clearly in that second category [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2097.76s)]
*  But it doesn't mean why is it in that category? Well, it doesn't mean that it won't work in our group chat with the rest of the guys [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2105.0400000000004s)]
*  One person said there's a lot of complex law [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2111.6000000000004s)]
*  when you [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2114.96s)]
*  Go from a non-profit to a for-profit. There's lots of complexity in deal construction. The original investors have certain [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2116.6400000000003s)]
*  Things that they want to see [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2124.4s)]
*  There may or may not be you know legal issues at play here that you encapsulated well in the last episode [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2126.56s)]
*  I think there's a lot of stuff. We don't know so I think it's important to just like [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2132.8s)]
*  Give those folks the benefit of the doubt. But yeah, if you're asking me [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2137.52s)]
*  It's in the two hard bucket for me to really take seriously now that being said [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2141.28s)]
*  It's not like I got shown the deal. So I can't I can't comment. Here's what I will say [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2145.36s)]
*  The first part of what sac said I think is really important for entrepreneurs to internalize which is where can we make money? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2150.96s)]
*  The reality is that [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2159.44s)]
*  Well, let me just take a prediction. I think that google will open source their models because [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2161.84s)]
*  the most important thing that google can do is reinforce the value of search [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2168.32s)]
*  And the best way to do that is to scorch the earth with these models [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2174.3999999999996s)]
*  Which is to make them widely available and as free as possible [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2178.24s)]
*  That will cause microsoft to have to catch up and that will cause facebook to have to really look in the mirror and decide [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2183.12s)]
*  Whether they're going to cap [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2190.24s)]
*  The betting that they've made on arvr and reallocate very aggressively to ai I mentioned this in the [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2192.48s)]
*  I did this lex friedman podcast, but that should be what facebook does and and the reason is [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2199.7599999999998s)]
*  If facebook and google and microsoft have roughly the same capability in the same model [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2205.12s)]
*  There's an element [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2210.56s)]
*  Of machine learning that I think is very important which is called reinforcement learning and specifically it's reinforcement learning from human feedback [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2212.16s)]
*  Right. So these rlhf pipelines. These are the things [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2219.9199999999996s)]
*  That will make your stuff unique. So if you're a startup [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2223.9199999999996s)]
*  You can build a reinforcement learning pipeline how you build a product that captures a bunch of usage [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2227.4399999999996s)]
*  We talked about this before that data set is unique to you as a company [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2233.3599999999997s)]
*  You can feed that into these models get back better answers. You can make money from it [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2237.68s)]
*  Facebook has an enormous amount of reinforcement learning inside of facebook every click [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2242.54s)]
*  Every comment every like every share [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2248.48s)]
*  Twitter has that data set google inside of gmail and search [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2252.08s)]
*  Microsoft inside of minecraft and hotmail. So my point is [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2257.68s)]
*  David's right the huge companies [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2262.0s)]
*  I think [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2264.9599999999996s)]
*  Will create the substrates [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2266.3199999999997s)]
*  And I think there'll be forced to scorch the earth and give it away for free [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2268.7999999999997s)]
*  And then on top of that is where you can make money and I would just encourage entrepreneurs to think [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2274.3199999999997s)]
*  Where is my edge in creating a data set that I can use for reinforcement learning that I think is interesting [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2279.3599999999997s)]
*  That's kind of saying I buy the ingredients from the supermarket [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2285.52s)]
*  But then I can still construct a dish that's unique and you know, the salt is there the pepper is there [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2289.68s)]
*  But how I use that will determine whether you like the thing or not [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2295.6s)]
*  And I think that you know, that is the way that I think we need to start thinking about it interestingly [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2299.12s)]
*  As we've all pointed out here open ai was started as a non-profit [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2304.72s)]
*  The stated philosophy was this technology is too powerful for any company to own [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2308.8s)]
*  Therefore we're going to make it open source and then somewhere in the last couple years they said well, you know what actually? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2313.68s)]
*  It's too powerful for it to be out there in the public [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2318.7999999999997s)]
*  we need to make this a private company and we need to [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2322.0s)]
*  Get 10 billion dollars from microsoft. That is the the disconnect. I am trying to understand [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2326.16s)]
*  That's the most interesting part of the story. Jason. I think if you go back to 2014 is when google bought deep mind [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2331.68s)]
*  Yeah, and immediately everyone started reacting to a company as powerful as google having a toolkit and a team [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2338.24s)]
*  As powerful as deep mind within them and that that sort of power should not sit in anyone's hands [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2345.3599999999997s)]
*  I heard people that i'm close with that are close to the organization and the company [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2350.64s)]
*  Comment that they thought this is the most kind of scary threatening biggest threat to humanity [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2354.72s)]
*  Uh is google's control of deep mind and that was a naive kind of point of view [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2360.0s)]
*  But it was one that was close that was deeply held by a lot of people so reid hoffman peter teal elon musk [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2364.64s)]
*  A lot of these guys funded the original kind of open ai business in 2015 and here's the link [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2369.7599999999998s)]
*  So i'm putting it out here. Um, you guys can pull up the original blog post [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2375.68s)]
*  Do all those don't people who donated get stock in so what happened was they were all in it was all in a non-profit [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2379.12s)]
*  And then the non-profit owned stock in a commercial business now [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2385.04s)]
*  But your point is interesting because at the beginning the idea was instead of having google own all of this will make it all available [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2388.24s)]
*  And here's the the the statement from the original blog post in 2015 open ai is a non-profit ai research company [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2394.3199999999997s)]
*  Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2401.2s)]
*  Unconstrained by a need to generate financial return [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2406.4599999999996s)]
*  Since our research is free from financial obligations. We can better focus on a positive human impact [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2410.16s)]
*  And they you know kind of went on and the whole thing about sam [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2416.0s)]
*  Greg elon reed jessica peter teal aws [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2418.88s)]
*  Yc are all donating to support open ai including donations and commitments of over a billion dollars [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2422.7200000000003s)]
*  Although we expect that to only be a tiny fraction of what we will spend in the next few years [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2428.32s)]
*  Which is a really interesting kind of [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2435.1200000000003s)]
*  If you look back historical perspective on how this thing all started seven years ago and how quickly it's evolved as you point out [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2437.28s)]
*  Into the necessity to have a real commercial alignment to drive this thing forward without seeing any of these models open-sourced [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2444.08s)]
*  And during that same same period of time [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2450.7200000000003s)]
*  We've seen google share alpha fold and share a number of tensor kind of predictive models [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2453.44s)]
*  And and tool kits and make them publicly available and put them [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2458.56s)]
*  In google's cloud and so there's both kind of tooling and models and outputs of those models that google has open-sourced [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2462.88s)]
*  And made freely available and meanwhile open ai has kind of diverged into this deeply profitable profit-seeking [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2469.7799999999997s)]
*  Kind of enterprise model and when you invest in open ai [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2476.9s)]
*  In the round that they did before you could generate a financial return capped at 100x [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2480.9s)]
*  Which is still a pretty amazing financial return you put a billion dollars in you can make a hundred billion dollars. That's that's funding a real commercial [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2486.02s)]
*  Endeavor at that point well and then to it is the most striking question about this whole thing about what's going on in [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2493.3s)]
*  ai and it's one that elon's talked about publicly and others have kind of sat on one side or the other [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2499.2999999999997s)]
*  Which is that ai? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2505.06s)]
*  Offers a glimpse into one of the biggest and most kind of existential threats to humanity [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2507.86s)]
*  And the question we're all going to be tackling and the battle that's going to be happening politically and regulatory wise [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2513.46s)]
*  And perhaps even between nations in the years to come is who owns the ai who owns the models? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2520.1s)]
*  What can they do with it and what are we legally going to be allowed to do with it? [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2525.38s)]
*  And this is a really important part of that story. Yeah to build on what you're saying [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2528.42s)]
*  Uh, I just put in pie torch people don't know that's another framework. Uh p y t o r c h [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2531.94s)]
*  This was you know largely built inside of facebook and then facebook said hey we want to democratize machine learning [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2538.26s)]
*  And they made and I think they put a bunch of executives [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2544.82s)]
*  They may have even funded those executives to go work on this open source project [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2547.46s)]
*  So they have a huge stake in this and they went [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2551.94s)]
*  Very open source with it and then tensorflow which you have an investment in [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2555.7799999999997s)]
*  tramath [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2560.9s)]
*  tensorflow was inside of i don't i don't have a [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2562.08s)]
*  Investment in tensorflow we build tensorflow the public source came out of google and then you invested in another company [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2565.7799999999997s)]
*  But we we're building silicon for machine learning. That's different [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2570.98s)]
*  Right, but it's based on tensorflow [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2574.2599999999998s)]
*  No, no, no, no, it's the the the founder of this company was the founder of tensorflow. Oh got it. Okay [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2576.9s)]
*  I'm sorry not of tensorflow part of me of the of tpu which was google's internal silicon that they built [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2582.82s)]
*  To accelerate tensorflow, right if that makes sense [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2589.46s)]
*  And so that's the you know, I don't mean to be cynical about the whole project or not [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2593.38s)]
*  It's just the confounding part of this of what is happening here. It reminds me. I don't know if you remember this [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2598.7400000000002s)]
*  The biggest opportunity here the biggest opportunity here is for facebook. I mean they need to get in this conversation [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2604.34s)]
*  Asap, I mean to think that like look pytorch was like a pretty seminal piece of technology that a lot of folks in [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2610.56s)]
*  In ai and machine learning were using for a long time [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2618.58s)]
*  Tensorflow before that and what's so funny about like google and facebook is they're a little bit kind of like [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2622.82s)]
*  They're not really making that much progress. I mean facebook released this kind of like [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2628.98s)]
*  rando version of alpha fold recently [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2634.26s)]
*  It's not that good [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2637.2200000000003s)]
*  I think these companies really need to get these products in the wild as soon as possible [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2640.9s)]
*  It cannot be the case that you have to email people and get on some lists. I mean, this is google and facebook guys. Come on [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2645.54s)]
*  Get going is the [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2652.1s)]
*  I think the big innovation of open ai sax [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2654.02s)]
*  To bring you in the conversation [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2657.94s)]
*  They actually made an interface and let the public play with it to the tune of three million dollars a day in cloud credits or costs [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2659.54s)]
*  Which by the way just on that my my son was telling me he's like hey dad [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2668.9s)]
*  Do you want me to tell you when the best time to use chat gbt is i'm like, huh? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2672.74s)]
*  He's like, yeah, my friends and I've tried we've been using it so much. We know now [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2676.2599999999998s)]
*  When we can actually get resources. Oh, wow, and it's such an interesting thing where like a 13 year old kid knows [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2681.06s)]
*  You know when it's mostly compute intensive that it's unusable and when to come back and use it when's the last time [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2687.54s)]
*  Sax the technology became this mainstream and captured people's imagination this broadly [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2693.7s)]
*  Uh, it's been a while. I don't know maybe the iphone or something. Yeah. Yeah. Look, it's it's powerful [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2700.42s)]
*  There's there's no question. It's powerful. I mean i'm of two minds about it because [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2705.54s)]
*  Whenever something is the hype cycle. I just reflexively want to be skeptical of it [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2709.7799999999997s)]
*  But on the other hand we have made a few investments [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2713.94s)]
*  in this area [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2716.6600000000003s)]
*  And I mean, I think it is powerful and it's it's going to be an enabler of some really cool things to come [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2718.1s)]
*  There's no question about it. I have two pieces of more insider information [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2723.2200000000003s)]
*  One I have a chat gpt ios app on my phone one of the nice folks at open ai included me in the test flight [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2728.02s)]
*  And it's the simplest interface you've ever seen but basically you type in your question [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2735.54s)]
*  But it keeps your history and then you can search your history. So it looks sax like you're in iMessage [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2739.62s)]
*  Basically, and it has your threads. And so I asked him. Hey, what are the best restaurants in yawnville? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2745.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, a town near um nappa and then I said which one has the best duck [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2750.1s)]
*  And it literally like gave me a great answer and then I thought wait a second [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2755.46s)]
*  Why is this not using a siri or alexa like interface? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2758.66s)]
*  And then why isn't it? Oh, here's a video of it [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2762.8199999999997s)]
*  I gave the video to nick by the way, jason this what you're doing right now is you're creating a human feedback [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2764.9s)]
*  Reinforcement learning pipeline for chad gpt [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2771.04s)]
*  So just the fact that you ask that question [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2773.78s)]
*  And you know over time if chad gpt has access to your gps information and then knows that you went to restaurant a versus b [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2776.6600000000003s)]
*  You can intuit and it may actually prompt you to ask. Hey jason [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2784.42s)]
*  We noticed you were in the area. Did you go to botega? If you did, how would you rate it one through five? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2788.7400000000002s)]
*  That reinforcement learning now allows the next person that asks [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2794.02s)]
*  What are the top five restaurants to say? Well, you know over a thousand people that have asked this question [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2797.22s)]
*  Here's actually the best answer versus a generic rank of the open web, which is what the first data set is [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2801.94s)]
*  That's what's so interesting about this. So this is why [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2808.34s)]
*  If you're a company that already owns the eyeballs [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2811.7s)]
*  You have to be running to get this stuff out there [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2814.66s)]
*  Well, and then this answer, uh, you know cited yelp [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2817.7s)]
*  Well, this is the first time i've actually seen chad gpt site and this is I think a major legal breakthrough [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2821.06s)]
*  It didn't put a link in [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2826.82s)]
*  But if it's going to use yelp's data, I don't know if they have permission from yelp, but it's quoting yelp here [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2828.58s)]
*  It should link to french longi botega and bouchon bouchon actually has the best duck confit [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2833.62s)]
*  For the record and I did have that duck. So I asked this afterwards to see [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2839.06s)]
*  You know in a scenario like this, but it could also if I was talking to it [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2843.06s)]
*  I could say hey, which one has availability this afternoon or tomorrow for dinner? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2847.06s)]
*  And make the phone call for me like google assistant does or any number of I was thinking about next tasks [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2851.94s)]
*  This was an incredibly powerful [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2857.94s)]
*  Display in a 1.0 product. I was thinking about what you said last week and I thought back [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2860.2599999999998s)]
*  to the music industry in [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2865.7799999999997s)]
*  in the [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2868.42s)]
*  world of napster [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2869.46s)]
*  And what happened was there was a lot of musicians. I think metallica being the most [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2871.86s)]
*  Famous one famously suing [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2876.66s)]
*  Napster because it was like hey listen like you're allowing people to take my content [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2879.54s)]
*  Which they would otherwise pay for there's economic damage that I can measure [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2884.1s)]
*  That legal argument was meaningful enough that ultimately napster was shut down now [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2888.18s)]
*  There were other versions of that that folks created including us at winamp. We created a headless version of that [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2892.02s)]
*  But if you translate that problem set here [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2898.58s)]
*  Is there a claim that yelp can make in this example? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2901.7799999999997s)]
*  That they're losing money [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2905.62s)]
*  That you know if you were going through google [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2907.86s)]
*  Or if you are going through their app [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2911.46s)]
*  There's the sponsored link revenue and the advertising revenue that they would have got that they wouldn't get from here [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2913.7000000000003s)]
*  Now that doesn't mean that chat gpt can't figure that out [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2918.98s)]
*  But it's those kinds of problems that are going to be a little thorny in these next few years that have to really get figured out [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2922.34s)]
*  This is a very if you are if you are a human reading every review on yelp about [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2929.46s)]
*  duck [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2935.2200000000003s)]
*  Then you could write a blog post in which you say many reviewers on yelp say that buchon is the best doc. So [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2936.34s)]
*  The question is like is gpt held to that standard or exactly or something different? [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2943.46s)]
*  And and it's linking to it is linking to it enough. This is the question that i'm asking [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2949.62s)]
*  I don't I don't know it should be because i'll argue it should be because if you look at the four-part test for fair use [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2953.46s)]
*  Which I had to go through because blogging had the same issue [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2959.38s)]
*  We would write a blog post and we would mention walt mosberg's review of a product and somebody else's and then people would say [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2961.62s)]
*  Oh, I don't need to read walt mosberg's in need of wall street journal subscription and we say well [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2967.62s)]
*  We're doing an original work. We're comparing two or three different [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2971.14s)]
*  You know human is comparing two or three different reviews and we're adding something to it. It's a you know, it's it's not a [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2975.7s)]
*  It's not interfering with walt mosberg's ability to get subscribers in the wall street journal [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2982.98s)]
*  but the effect on the potential market is one of the four tests and [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2987.38s)]
*  Just reading from stanford's quote on fair use another important fair use factor is whether your use [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2991.62s)]
*  Deprives the copyright owner of income or undermines a new or potential market for the copyrighted work [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=2996.8199999999997s)]
*  Depriving a copyright owner of income is very likely to trigger a lawsuit. This is true [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3003.2799999999997s)]
*  Even if you are not competing directly with the original work [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3007.94s)]
*  And we'll put the link to stanford here [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3011.2999999999997s)]
*  This is the key issue and I would not use yelp in this example [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3013.22s)]
*  I would not open the yelp app yelp would get no commerce and yelp would lose this so [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3017.14s)]
*  Chat gbt and all these services must use citations of where they got the original work [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3021.54s)]
*  They must link to them and they must get permission. That's where this is all going to shake out [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3027.46s)]
*  And I believe that's but forget about permission. I mean you can't get a big enough data set if you have to get permission in advance [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3031.06s)]
*  Right. Well, no, it's gonna be the large data sets quora yelp [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3037.78s)]
*  The app store reviews amazon's reviews [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3042.44s)]
*  So there are large corpuses of data that you would need like craigslist has famously never allowed anybody to scrape craigslist [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3045.4s)]
*  The amount of data inside craigslist as but one example of a data set would be extraordinary to build chat gpt on [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3052.12s)]
*  Chat gbt is not allowed to because as you brought up robots.txt last week [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3058.76s)]
*  There's going to need to be an ai.txt [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3065.0s)]
*  AI.txt are you allowed to use my data set in ai and under and how [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3067.08s)]
*  Will I be compensated for it? I'll allow you to use craigslist, but you have to link to the original post [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3071.88s)]
*  And you have to note that the other gray area that isn't there today but may [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3078.52s)]
*  Emerge is when section 230 gets rewritten [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3083.8s)]
*  because if they take the protections away for the facebook and the googles of the world for the basically for being an algorithmic publisher and [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3087.56s)]
*  Saying an algorithm is equivalent to a publisher [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3094.84s)]
*  What it essentially saying is that an algorithm is kind of like doing the work of a human in a certain context [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3098.44s)]
*  And I wonder whether that's also an angle here which now this algorithm which today david you use you said the example [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3103.5600000000004s)]
*  I read all these blog posts. I write something [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3109.88s)]
*  But if an algorithm does it maybe can you then say no actually there was intent there [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3112.44s)]
*  That's different than if a human were to do it. I don't know. My point is [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3116.92s)]
*  Is very complicated issues that are going to get sorted out and I think the problem with the hype cycle [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3119.96s)]
*  Is that you're going to have to marry it with an economic model for vcs to really make money [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3128.2s)]
*  And right now there's just too much betting on the come so to the extent you're going to invest [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3132.92s)]
*  It makes sense that you put money into open ai because that's safe [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3137.2400000000002s)]
*  Because the economic model of how you make money for everybody else is so unclear [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3141.8s)]
*  Right. It's clear. Actually. I have it for business [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3145.8s)]
*  I just signed up for chat gpt premium [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3148.8399999999997s)]
*  They had a survey that they shared on their discord server and I filled out the survey and they did a price discovery survey [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3151.3199999999997s)]
*  Friedberg, what's the least you would pay the most you would pay? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3157.96s)]
*  What would be too cheap of a price for chat gpt pro? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3161.24s)]
*  And what would be too high of a price I put in like 50 bucks a month was would be what I would pay [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3164.44s)]
*  But I was just thinking imagine chat gpt allowed you friedberg to have a slack channel [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3169.0s)]
*  Called research and you could go in there or anytime you're in slack you do slash chat [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3173.8s)]
*  Or slash chat gpt and you say slash chat gpt. Tell me [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3179.08s)]
*  you know, what are the venues available in which we did this actually for [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3182.92s)]
*  I did this for venues for all in subreddit. What are the venues that seat over 3 000 people? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3188.28s)]
*  in [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3193.08s)]
*  Vegas and it just gave us the answer. Okay. Well, that was the job of a [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3194.04s)]
*  of the local [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3198.2000000000003s)]
*  Event planner they had that list now you can pull that list from a bunch of different sources. I mean, what would you pay for that? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3200.04s)]
*  a lot [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3206.92s)]
*  Well, I think one of the big things that's happening is all the old business models [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3209.0s)]
*  Don't make sense anymore [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3214.2799999999997s)]
*  In a world where the software is no longer just doing what it's done for the last 60 years [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3216.36s)]
*  Which is what is historically defined as information retrieval? [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3222.44s)]
*  So you have this kind of hierarchical [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3226.36s)]
*  Storage of data [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3228.6800000000003s)]
*  that [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3230.36s)]
*  You have some index against and then you go and you search and you pull data out [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3231.4s)]
*  And then you present that data back to the customer or the user of the software and that's effectively been how [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3235.4s)]
*  all kind of data [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3241.8s)]
*  Has been utilized in all systems for the past [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3244.44s)]
*  60 years in computing [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3247.88s)]
*  Largely what we've really done is kind of built an evolution of application layers or software tools [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3249.7200000000003s)]
*  To interface with the fetching of that data the retrieval of that data and the display of that data [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3255.4799999999996s)]
*  But what these systems are now doing what ai type systems or machine learning systems now do [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3260.4399999999996s)]
*  Is the synthesis of that data and the representation of some synthesis of that data to you the user [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3265.8799999999997s)]
*  In a way that doesn't necessarily look anything like the original data that was used to make that synthesis [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3273.08s)]
*  And that's where business models like a yelp for example [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3279.4s)]
*  Or like a web crawler that crawls the web and then presents web page directories to you [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3282.36s)]
*  Those sorts of models no longer make sense in a world where the software the signal to noise is now greater [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3287.6400000000003s)]
*  The signal is greater than the noise in being able to present to you a synthesis of that data and basically resolve [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3292.76s)]
*  What your objective is with your own consumption and interpretation of that data, which is how you've historically used these systems [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3299.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think that's where there's you know going back to the question of the hype cycle [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3306.68s)]
*  I don't think it's about being a hype cycle. I think it's about the the investment opportunity [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3310.6s)]
*  Against fundamentally rewriting all compute tools because if all compute tools ultimately can use [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3315.24s)]
*  This capability in their interface and in their modeling then it very much changes everything and one of the advantages that I think [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3321.4s)]
*  businesses are going to latch onto which we talked about historically [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3328.36s)]
*  Is novelty in their data in being able to build new systems and new models? [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3331.64s)]
*  That aren't generally available example in biotech and pharma for example [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3336.7599999999998s)]
*  having [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3342.92s)]
*  screening results from from very expensive [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3344.2799999999997s)]
*  Experiments and running lots of experiments and having a lot of data against those experiments gives a company an advantage [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3347.86s)]
*  In being able to do things like drug discovering we're going to talk about that in a minute [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3355.16s)]
*  Versus everyone using publicly known screening libraries or publicly available protein modeling libraries [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3359.16s)]
*  And then screening against those and then everyone's got the same candidates and the same targets and the same [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3365.56s)]
*  You know kind of clinical objectives that they're going to try and resolve from from that output. So, um, so I think novelty and data [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3369.8s)]
*  Is is one way that advantage kind of arises but really, you know, that's just kind of you know, where's there an edge? [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3377.2400000000002s)]
*  but fundamentally every business model can and will need to be rewritten that's [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3383.56s)]
*  dependent on the historical [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3389.06s)]
*  On the legacy of kind of information retrieval as the core of what computing is is used to do [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3391.46s)]
*  Sax on my other podcast. I was having a discussion with molly about the legal profession [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3397.2999999999997s)]
*  What impact would it be if chant gpt took every court case? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3402.5s)]
*  Every argument every document and somebody took all of those [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3406.5s)]
*  Legal cases on the legal profession and then the filing of a lawsuit the defending of a lawsuit [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3411.86s)]
*  Public defenders prosecutors [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3419.1400000000003s)]
*  What data could you figure out like if and like just to think in recent history look at chesa buddhien [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3422.1000000000004s)]
*  You could literally take [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3427.86s)]
*  every case every argument he did put it through it and say, you know versus an outcome in another state and you could [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3429.38s)]
*  Uh figure out what's actually going on with this technology [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3436.1800000000003s)]
*  What impact did this have on the legal field that you are a non-practicing attorney? You have a legal degree. I I never practiced [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3439.86s)]
*  Other than one summer at a law firm, but no, I think you passed the bar. What's that? I did pass the bar. Yes [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3447.14s)]
*  Yes, I did. I yes, of course, of course. Yeah, come on. You gotta be kind of dumb [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3452.5s)]
*  I may not have passed the bar, but I know a little shit enough to know that you can't look I [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3462.34s)]
*  I would be curious in terms of a very common question [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3467.06s)]
*  that a an associate at a law firm would get asked would be something like [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3472.26s)]
*  You know summarize the legal precedents in favor of x right and that you can imagine [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3476.5s)]
*  GPT doing that like instantly now. I think that the question about that. I think there's two questions one is [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3483.6s)]
*  Can you prompt gpt in the right way to get the answer you want and I think you know tramath [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3490.5s)]
*  You shared a really interesting video showing that people are developing some skills around knowing how to ask [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3494.9s)]
*  gpt questions in the right way exact prompt engineering [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3501.12s)]
*  Why because gpt is a command line interface? So if you ask gpt a simple question about what's the best restaurant in? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3505.56s)]
*  You know napa it knows how to answer that but there are much more complicated questions that you kind of need to know [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3511.96s)]
*  How to prompt it in the right way [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3517.88s)]
*  So it's not clear to me that a command line interface is the best way of doing that. I could imagine [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3519.16s)]
*  Apps developing that create more of like a gooey. So we're an investor for example on copy ai [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3523.8s)]
*  Which is doing this for copywriters and marketers helping them write blog posts and emails and so, you know [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3528.28s)]
*  Imagine putting that like, you know [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3534.92s)]
*  Gooey on top of chad gpt. They've already been kind of doing this [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3537.8s)]
*  So [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3541.96s)]
*  I think that's part of it. I think the other part of it is on the answer side [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3543.0s)]
*  You know, how accurate is it? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3547.4s)]
*  Because in some professions having 90 or 95 or 99 accuracy is okay [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3549.8s)]
*  But in other professions you need six nines accuracy meaning [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3556.6800000000003s)]
*  99.999 accuracy, okay, so [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3561.06s)]
*  I think for a lawyer [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3565.0s)]
*  Going into court, you know, you probably need [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3567.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know. I mean depends on on the [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3570.44s)]
*  Question versus a murder trial is two very different. Yeah, exactly. So is 99 accuracy good enough is [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3573.08s)]
*  95 accuracy good enough. I would say probably [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3580.58s)]
*  For a court case 95 is probably not good enough. I'm not sure gpt is at even 95 yet [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3583.64s)]
*  But could it be helpful like could could could the associates start? [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3590.2000000000003s)]
*  With chat gpt get an answer and then validate it probably. Yeah, if you had a bunch of associates [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3594.2s)]
*  bang on some law model for a year [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3601.0s)]
*  Again, that's that reinforcement learning we just talked about [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3604.28s)]
*  I think you'd get precision recall off the charts and it would be perfect. By the way, just a cute thing [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3607.32s)]
*  I don't know if you guys got this email. It came about an hour ago from reid hoffman and reid said to me h-mouth. I [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3613.08s)]
*  I created fireside chat bots [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3619.72s)]
*  A special podcast mini series [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3622.52s)]
*  Where I will be having a set of conversations with chat gpt [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3625.1600000000003s)]
*  So you can go to youtube by the way and and see reid having and he's a very smart guy [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3628.76s)]
*  So this should be kind of cool [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3633.4s)]
*  And by the way chat gpt will have an ai generated voice [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3635.7200000000003s)]
*  powered by [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3639.2400000000002s)]
*  the text-to-speech platform play dot ht [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3640.76s)]
*  go to youtube if you want to see reid have a [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3645.0s)]
*  Have a conversation with chat gpt. I mean trumoth [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3647.6400000000003s)]
*  We have a conversation with the two davids every week. What's the difference? We know how this is going to turn out [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3651.4s)]
*  Hey, but actually so synthesizing. Um jamas point about reinforcement learning with something you said jcal in our chat [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3657.64s)]
*  Which I actually thought was pretty smart. Well, that's first [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3664.44s)]
*  Yeah, so i'm gonna give you credit here because I don't think you've said it on this [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3667.96s)]
*  This episode which is you said [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3671.64s)]
*  That these open ai capabilities are eventually going to become commoditized or certainly much more widely available [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3674.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't know if that means that they'll be totally commoditized or there'll be four players [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3681.0s)]
*  But there'll be multiple players that offer them and you said the real advantage will come from [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3684.3599999999997s)]
*  applications that are able to get a hold of proprietary data sets [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3690.2599999999998s)]
*  And then use those proprietary data sets to generate insights and then layering on what jama said about reinforcement learning [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3694.2s)]
*  If you can be the first out there in a given vertical with a proprietary data set [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3700.7599999999998s)]
*  And then you get the advantage the moat of reinforcement learning [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3705.3999999999996s)]
*  That would be the way to create I think a sustainable business just to build on what you said this week is the jp morgan conference [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3709.4s)]
*  Friberg mentioned it last week. I had dinner on wednesday with this really interesting company [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3716.76s)]
*  based in zurich and [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3721.88s)]
*  What they have is basically a library of ligands, right? [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3724.36s)]
*  And so these ligands are used as a substrate to deliver all kinds of molecules inside the body [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3727.7200000000003s)]
*  And what's interesting is that they have a portfolio of like a thousand of these but really what they have [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3733.32s)]
*  Is they have all the nuclear medicine about whether it works [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3739.2400000000002s)]
*  So, you know there they target glioblastoma glioblastoma and so all of a sudden they can they can say well this ligand can actually [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3743.0s)]
*  Cross the blood vein barrier and get to the brain [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3749.8s)]
*  They have an entire data set of that a whole bunch of nuclear imagery around that they have something for soft cell carcinoma [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3752.44s)]
*  So then they have that data set so to your point [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3758.52s)]
*  That's really valuable because that's real work [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3761.64s)]
*  That google or microsoft or open ai [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3764.84s)]
*  Won't do right and if you have that and you bring it to the problem [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3769.48s)]
*  You can probably make money. You know, there's a business there to be built [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3773.96s)]
*  Just building on this conversation. I just realized like a great prompt engineer [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3777.8s)]
*  Is going to become a title and an actual skill the ability to interface with these here you go. Yeah [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3782.92s)]
*  Well, no a prompt engineer somebody who is very good at talking to [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3790.2000000000003s)]
*  These you know instances and and maximizing the result for them and refining the results for them just like a detective who asks great questions [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3794.7599999999998s)]
*  The that person is going to be 10 or 20 times more valuable. They could be the proverbial 10x engineer [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3803.16s)]
*  In the future of as a as in a company [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3810.2s)]
*  and as we talk about austerity and doing more with less and the 80 less people running twitter now or [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3813.24s)]
*  Amazon laying off 18 000 people salesforce laying off 8 000 facebook laying off 10 and probably another 10 000 [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3819.8s)]
*  What catalytic effect like could this have we could be sitting here in three or four or five years and [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3826.6800000000003s)]
*  Instead of running a company like twitter with 80% less people. Maybe you could run it with 98% less people [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3832.6s)]
*  Look, I think directionally it's the the right statement [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3837.56s)]
*  I mean, you know, i've i've made the statement a number of times that I think we move from this idea of [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3840.6s)]
*  Creator economy to narrator economy where historically it was kind of labor economy where humans use their physical labor to do things [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3846.6800000000003s)]
*  Then we were knowledge workers. We used our our brains to to make things [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3853.7200000000003s)]
*  And then ultimately we kind of I think resolve to this narrator economy where the the way that you kind of can state intention and better [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3859.32s)]
*  Manipulate the tools to drive your intentional outcome the more successful you're going to be and you can kind of think about this as being [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3866.82s)]
*  the artist of the past [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3872.52s)]
*  Da vinci was um [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3874.2799999999997s)]
*  What made him so good was he was technically [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3876.7599999999998s)]
*  incredible at trying to reproduce a photographic like imagery using [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3879.7s)]
*  Using paint and there's these really great kind of museum exhibits on how he did it using these really interesting kind of like split mirror [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3885.3199999999997s)]
*  systems [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3893.8799999999997s)]
*  And then the the better the artist of the 21st century the 20th century was the best user of adobe photoshop [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3895.0s)]
*  And that person is not necessarily the best painter and the artist of the 22nd century isn't going to look like the photoshop [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3901.0s)]
*  Expert and it's not going to look like the the painter. It's going to look like something entirely different [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3909.16s)]
*  It could be who's who's got the most creative imagination in driving the software to drive new outcomes [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3913.96s)]
*  And I think that the same analogy can be used across every market in every industry [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3919.08s)]
*  However, one thing to note jcal [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3923.08s)]
*  It's it's not about austerity because the the the luddite argument is [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3925.24s)]
*  When you have new tools and you get more leverage from those tools [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3930.04s)]
*  You have less work for people to do and therefore everyone suffers [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3933.3199999999997s)]
*  The reality is new work emerges and new opportunities emerge and we level up as a species [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3936.7599999999998s)]
*  And when we level up we all kind of fill the gaps and expand our productivity and our capability set [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3942.3599999999997s)]
*  I thought what jcal was saying was more that google will be smaller didn't mean that the pie wouldn't grow [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3947.3199999999997s)]
*  It's just that that individual company is run differently [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3952.04s)]
*  But there will be hundreds of more companies or thousands more millions more. Yeah, that's sort of I have an actual punch up for you [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3955.48s)]
*  Yeah, instead of narrative. It's the conductor economy. It's you're you're conducting a symphony. Oh a punch up [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3962.44s)]
*  Punch up there, but I do think like we're gonna there's gonna be somebody who's sitting there like [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3969.48s)]
*  Remember tom cruise in minority report as a detective was moving stuff around with a interface the in yeah, you know with the gloves and everything [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3973.88s)]
*  This is kind of that manifested you could even if you're not an attorney you can say hey [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3981.88s)]
*  I want to sue this company for copyright infringement. Give me my best arguments and then on the other side say hey [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3986.12s)]
*  I want to know what the next three features I should put into my product is [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3991.08s)]
*  Can you examine who are my top 20 competitors? [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3994.6s)]
*  And then who have they hired in the last six months and what are those people talking about on 20? [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=3997.1600000000003s)]
*  You can have this conductor [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4000.84s)]
*  You know who becomes really good at that. Well the leveling up [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4003.1600000000003s)]
*  Massive amounts of tasks. Yeah, the leveling up that happens in the book enders game [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4006.36s)]
*  I think is a good example of this where the guy goes through the entire kind of ground up and then ultimately he's commanding armies of [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4010.7599999999998s)]
*  Spaceships and space and his orchestration of all of these armies is actually the skill set that wins the war [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4018.42s)]
*  Yeah, you predicted that there would be like all these people that create these next-gen forms of content [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4024.84s)]
*  But I think this reed hoffman thing could be pretty cool. Like what if he wins a grammy? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4030.68s)]
*  For his you know computer created podcast mini series. That's what i'm saying [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4035.08s)]
*  The thing i'm really excited about when's the first ai novel going to get published by a major publisher? [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4039.72s)]
*  I think it happens this year [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4044.36s)]
*  When's the first ai symphony going to get performed by major symphony orchestra? [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4045.72s)]
*  And when's the first ai generated screenplay get turned into an ai generated 3d movie that we all watch and then the more exciting one [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4049.4s)]
*  I think is when do we all get to make our own ai video game where we instruct the video game platform? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4055.96s)]
*  What world we want to live in? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4060.92s)]
*  I don't think that's happening for the next three or four years [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4062.12s)]
*  But when it does I think everyone's got these new immersive environments that they can live in I have a question [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4064.44s)]
*  When you know when I say live in I mean video game wise. Yeah, sorry [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4069.24s)]
*  When you have when you have these computer systems just like to use a question of game theory for a second. They're [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4072.52s)]
*  These models are iterating rapidly. These are all mathematical models. So [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4078.2799999999997s)]
*  Inherent in let's just say this the perfect answer right like if you had perfect precision recall [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4082.18s)]
*  If multiple models get there at a system-wide level everybody is is sort of like they get to the [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4089.32s)]
*  Game theory optimal. They're all at Nash equilibrium, right all these systems working at the same time [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4095.2400000000002s)]
*  Then the real question would then be what the hell do you do then? [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4100.28s)]
*  Because if you keep getting the same answer if everybody then knows how to ask the exact right question [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4104.84s)]
*  And you start to go through these iterations where you're like, maybe there is a dystopian hellscape [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4109.64s)]
*  Maybe that's the Elon world which is you can you can recursively [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4114.04s)]
*  Find a logical argument where there is no job that's possible [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4119.400000000001s)]
*  Right and now i'm not saying that that path is the likely path [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4124.36s)]
*  But i'm saying it is important to keep in mind that that path of outcomes [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4127.8s)]
*  Is still very important to keep in the back of our mind as we figure these things out [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4131.08s)]
*  Well freeberg, you know you were asking before about this like you know [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4135.4800000000005s)]
*  Will more work be created if the world is going to be a little bit more complicated? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4139.16s)]
*  Will more work be created of course artistic pursuits at podcasting is a job now being an influencer is a job [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4142.6s)]
*  yada yada new things emerge in the world, but [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4148.52s)]
*  Here in the united states in 1970. I'm looking at um, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4151.240000000001s)]
*  Fred, uh, i'm looking at the st louis fed 1970 26.4 percent [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4154.92s)]
*  Of the country was working in a factory was working in manufacturing. You want to guess what that is? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4159.56s)]
*  in 2012 [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4165.8s)]
*  Sorry, what percentage it was 26? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4167.72s)]
*  Percent in 1970 and in 2015 when they stopped the percentage in manufacturing in the united states they discontinued this it was a 10 [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4170.76s)]
*  So it's possible. We could just see you know [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4178.52s)]
*  The concept of office work the concept of knowledge work is going to follow pretty inevitable the path of manufacturing [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4182.12s)]
*  That that seems like a pretty logical theory or no? [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4190.6s)]
*  I think we should move on but yes, okay [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4195.08s)]
*  So how would we like to ruin the show now should we talk about biden and uh the documents and ruin the show with [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4197.4s)]
*  Political talk or should we talk about? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4203.38s)]
*  Since it's been such a great episode so far. What do we want to talk about next? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4207.96s)]
*  I'll give you a couple choices. Don't want to talk about [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4212.04s)]
*  Uh, so we're talking about [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4216.36s)]
*  Give it to him. Give it to him. Give it to him [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4219.16s)]
*  We all know [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4221.72s)]
*  Air glasses a second we all know jay cal that according to you when a president is in possession [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4223.72s)]
*  Of classified documents in his home. Yes, apparently have been taken in an unauthorized manner basically stolen [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4230.92s)]
*  He should have his home raided by the fbi almost close [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4237.88s)]
*  close, uh if [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4242.04s)]
*  so anyway [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4244.52s)]
*  the [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4246.04s)]
*  biden, uh as of the taping of this has now said there's a third batch of [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4246.84s)]
*  Classified documents this group I guess there was one at an office one at a library [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4253.0s)]
*  Now this third group is in his garage with his corvette [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4257.5599999999995s)]
*  Certainly not looking good. Uh, and they say they say that in his defense [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4260.44s)]
*  They say the garage was locked meaning that uh, you could use a garage door opener to the garage door [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4264.2s)]
*  To open or close it. That's it was locked when it went closed. So pretty much as secure as the documents at mar-a-lago [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4269.24s)]
*  Same equivalency. No, no, no, I actually I mean just to be perfectly fair [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4275.88s)]
*  The documents in mar-a-lago were locked in a basement the fbi came checked it out said we'd like you to lock those up [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4279.8s)]
*  They locked them up. So got a little safer than maybe a little safer than in the trunk of your corvette [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4285.320000000001s)]
*  But functionally the same functionally the same. Uh, the only difference here would be what sacks when you look at these two cases [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4291.16s)]
*  Well that in one case merrick garland has appointed an independent counsel to investigate trump and there's no such a special counsel [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4299.320000000001s)]
*  Or investigator appointed to investigate biden. I mean, yeah, these things are functionally put somebody on it though. Wait, yeah [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4307.0s)]
*  They put something on I don't think they've appointed a special counsel yet. No, they did as of an hour ago [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4313.320000000001s)]
*  A special counsel was appointed [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4318.12s)]
*  Okay, did that just happen? Yeah, one hour ago. Uh robert hers is named. Okay [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4320.280000000001s)]
*  I guess there are real questions to look into here. The documents apparently were moved twice [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4324.280000000001s)]
*  Why were they moved who ordered that? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4330.12s)]
*  What was a classified document doing in biden's personal library? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4332.68s)]
*  What do the documents pertain to? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4336.68s)]
*  Do they touch on the biden family's business dealings in ukraine and china? So there are real things to look into here [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4339.64s)]
*  But let me just take a step back [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4345.72s)]
*  Now that the last three presidential candidates have been ensnared [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4348.92s)]
*  In these classified document problems. Remember [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4353.320000000001s)]
*  It's biden now and then trump and hillary clinton before trump [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4356.92s)]
*  I think it's time to step back and ask [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4362.04s)]
*  Are we over classifying documents? I mean are we fetishizing these documents? Are they all really that sensitive? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4364.92s)]
*  it seems to me that we have an over classification problem meaning that [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4371.88s)]
*  ever since uh foyer was passed the freedom of information act [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4376.76s)]
*  The government can avoid accountability and prying eyes by simply labeling any document as classified [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4380.92s)]
*  So over classification was a logical response [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4387.72s)]
*  By the permanent government to the freedom of information act and now has gotten to the point [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4390.679999999999s)]
*  Where just about everything handed to a president or vice president is classified [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4396.12s)]
*  So I think I can understand why they're all making this mistake [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4400.92s)]
*  And I think a compounding problem is that we never declassify anything. There's still all these records [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4405.32s)]
*  From the kennedy assassination. Well, that's that i've never been declassified. They they and they're supposed to have [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4410.12s)]
*  declassified these the cia [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4416.58s)]
*  Keeps filibustering on the release of the jfk assassination documents [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4418.82s)]
*  And they've been told they have to stop and they have to release them and then they keep redacting stuff [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4424.66s)]
*  Which is making it. I mean, I hate to be a conspiracy theorist here, but [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4430.9s)]
*  What are they trying to cover up? I mean, this is a long time ago. That's the only way to interpret it [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4435.62s)]
*  But even for more mundane documents, there are very few documents that need to be classified after even say five years [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4440.9s)]
*  You could argue that we should be automatically declassifying them after five years unless they go through a process to get reclassified [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4447.219999999999s)]
*  I mean i'd say like [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4454.179999999999s)]
*  Just you guys in business. I know it's not government in business [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4456.099999999999s)]
*  How many of the documents that you deal with are still sensitive are trade secrets five years later? [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4459.379999999999s)]
*  Certainly 20 years certainly 20 years later. They're not right like in almost all cases like five years [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4466.42s)]
*  I mean the only documents the only documents in business that I think I deal with [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4471.299999999999s)]
*  That you could call sensitive are the ones that pertain to the company's [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4476.9s)]
*  Future plans right because you wouldn't want a cat table to get those [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4481.379999999999s)]
*  There's a handful of things legal issues. Yeah [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4485.54s)]
*  Even cap table is not that sensitive because by the time you go public it's legally has to be public. Yeah [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4488.179999999999s)]
*  It's on carter like there's a hundred people who have that. I mean it's exactly so like in business [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4493.379999999999s)]
*  I think our experience has been there's very few documents that stay [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4498.42s)]
*  Sensitive that need to remain secret [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4502.42s)]
*  Now look if biden or trump whoever they're reviewing the schematics [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4504.82s)]
*  To the javelin missile system or to you know, how we make our nuclear bombs or something [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4509.9400000000005s)]
*  Obviously that needs to stay secret forever, but I don't believe our politicians are reviewing those kinds of documents [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4515.46s)]
*  Well, I mean we both I don't really understand what it is that they're [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4521.38s)]
*  Reviewing why are they keeping them to be classified five years later? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4525.7s)]
*  Why are they keeping them was the issue we discussed previously. We actually agreed on that. I think they're just keeping mementos [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4528.9800000000005s)]
*  I think there's a simple explanation for why they're keeping them jason, which is [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4534.18s)]
*  that [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4537.9400000000005s)]
*  The that everything is more classified and there's a zillion documents [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4538.9800000000005s)]
*  And if you look like both biden and trump these documents were mixed in with a bunch of personal effects [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4543.9400000000005s)]
*  And mementos my point is if you work in government and handle documents, they're all classified [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4550.42s)]
*  So if the national archive asks for them back or you find them, you should just give them back [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4557.3s)]
*  I mean that is that's going to wind up being the rug here [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4562.18s)]
*  Trump didn't give them back and biden did so that's the only difference here [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4564.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, no, no, no, hold on the fbi went to trump's basement. They looked around they said put a lock on this [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4569.06s)]
*  They seemed to be okay with it initially then maybe they changed their minds. I don't know. I'm not defending trump [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4573.3s)]
*  It's pretty clear that he wouldn't give them back. Yeah, that was the point i'm making is that now that biden trump and [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4578.1s)]
*  Hillary clinton have all been ensnared in this [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4583.620000000001s)]
*  Is it time to rethink? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4586.42s)]
*  The fact that we're over classifying so many documents, I mean just think about the incentives that [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4588.34s)]
*  That we're creating for our politicians. Okay, just think about the incentives number one never use email [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4594.42s)]
*  Remember hillie clinton and the whole email server. Yeah, you gotta be nuts to use email number two never touch a document [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4600.02s)]
*  Never touch a document. Why never let anyone hand you a document flush them down the toilet [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4606.5s)]
*  Never let anyone hand you a document [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4612.42s)]
*  What if you're a politician an elected official [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4614.42s)]
*  Yeah, the only time you should ever be handling anything is go into a clean room, right? [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4618.58s)]
*  You know make an appointment go in there read something don't take notes. Don't bring a camera and then leave [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4623.14s)]
*  I mean, this is no way to run a government [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4628.82s)]
*  It's crazy. Who does this benefit? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4631.46s)]
*  Who does this benefit? It doesn't benefit our elected officials. It makes it almost impossible for them to act like normal people [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4634.1s)]
*  That's why it benefits the insiders the permanent government you're missing the most important part about the sex [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4640.9s)]
*  This was if you want to go into conspiracy theories [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4646.9s)]
*  This was a setup [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4649.94s)]
*  Biden planted the documents here so that we could create the false equivalency [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4651.38s)]
*  And start up biden versus trump 2024. This ensures that now trump has something to fight with biden about [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4656.1s)]
*  But and this is going to help trump because they're because they're both tainted equally tainted [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4663.0599999999995s)]
*  From the same source they are they are equally tainted now, but it puts trump in the new cycle [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4668.259999999999s)]
*  No, I think but I think it's the opposite. I think mary garland now is going to have to drop [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4672.82s)]
*  The prosecution against trump for the stolen documents or at least that part of what they're investigating him for [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4677.7s)]
*  They might still investigate him over january 6 or something. They can't investigate trump over documents now seems more sticky [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4684.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with that. Actually, I think it's going to be hard to do [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4689.62s)]
*  But my point is like just think about look both sides are engaged in hyperparsonship the way [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4692.42s)]
*  Right now the that the conservatives on the right they're attacking [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4697.62s)]
*  Biden now for the same thing that the left was attacking trump for my point is [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4701.94s)]
*  Like just take a step back and again think about the incentives we're creating about how to run our government [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4706.5s)]
*  You can't use email and you can't touch documents [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4711.86s)]
*  And everything's an investigation the second you get in the office [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4715.78s)]
*  And by the way, if you're don't ever go into politics if you're a business person because it'll investigate every deal you ever did [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4718.74s)]
*  Prior prior to getting into politics. I mean just think about the incentives [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4725.94s)]
*  What are you going to do when you try to get your your treasury position? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4729.46s)]
*  What's going to be nuts? You got to be nuts to go in a government. So you're not going to take a position in [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4732.74s)]
*  DeSantis' cabinet. My point is that that the that the washington insiders by which I mean the permanent washington establishment i.e. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4736.9s)]
*  The deep state they're creating a system [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4742.66s)]
*  In which they're running things and the elected officials barely can operate like normal functioning humans there [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4745.62s)]
*  Hmm interesting I heard I heard a great rumor. This is total gossip mongering. Oh, here we go [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4752.339999999999s)]
*  uh [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4759.94s)]
*  That you know one of [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4761.46s)]
*  Ken griffin's best out [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4763.78s)]
*  Is to get to santa selected so that he can become treasury secretary. I mean ken griffin would get that if he wanted it [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4765.94s)]
*  And then he would be able to divest all of citadel tax-free [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4773.54s)]
*  so he would mark the market like 30 billion dollars, which is [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4777.78s)]
*  A genius way to go out now, then it occurred to me. Oh my god. That is me and sax's path, too [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4781.62s)]
*  With a lot less money, but [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4788.74s)]
*  Wait, why would it be tax-free? [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4792.66s)]
*  When you get appointed to those branch those senior posts you're allowed to either stick it in a blind trust [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4794.98s)]
*  Or you can sell with no capital gains [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4801.379999999999s)]

*  If you have if you're forced to divest it to enter a government, you shouldn't be forcibly taxed on it [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4814.900000000001s)]
*  Mayor of san francisco or austin federal federal [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4819.780000000001s)]
*  Secretary of transportation jacob you can do that. Oh i'm qualified for that [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4823.700000000001s)]

*  There's a lot of folks that would buy that because that's just a securities trading business and then citadel the hedge fund [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4833.46s)]
*  Probably something like a big bulge bracket bank or blackstone probably blackstone in fact because now blackstone can plug it into [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4838.66s)]
*  A trillion dollar asset machine. It's a I think there would be [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=4845.54s)]

*  You'll see in a movie. So basically it's a bunch of people on an on a luxury yacht [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5032.36s)]

*  Oh, I thought you were gonna say a microcosm of something else and then and then what happens is there's like a shipwreck basically [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5057.16s)]

*  Yeah, well, you know why a ceo is actually in charge like elon [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5272.679999999999s)]
*  He walks in if he doesn't like what you're doing. He'll just fire you you can't fire anyone [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5276.5199999999995s)]
*  How do you manage them when they don't have to listen to anything you say? That's our whole government right now [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5280.679999999999s)]
*  Our cabinet heads are figureheads [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5287.88s)]
*  For for these departments these giant is that a no? [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5291.0s)]
*  Or is that a yes, you'd still take state [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5294.360000000001s)]
*  Look at that. See well, I you know, I think I have another thing [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5297.88s)]
*  I think he's going for the ambassadorship first. What is the best ambassadorship? Well, you can't you can't [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5300.76s)]
*  You can tell which ambassadorship is the best one based on how much they charge for it. Yeah [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5308.92s)]
*  So I think I think uh london is the most expensive. I think that one's 15 million for london 10 to 15 [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5313.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, 10 15 million. Yeah 10 15 million [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5318.84s)]
*  That's that's what sax's fourth least expensive home cost [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5322.68s)]
*  No, no, you have to spend that every year to run it jason [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5327.240000000001s)]
*  You only get you can't fix for him. You could be the ambassador to guinea or the ambassador to the uk [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5329.96s)]
*  You get the same budget [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5335.56s)]
*  Actually, what's kind of funny is I know two people who serve as ambassadors under trump [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5336.76s)]
*  And it was really cheap to get those because no one no one wanted to be part of the trump administration [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5340.52s)]
*  But oh they were a fire sale two for one they were on they were on fire sale after because of trump [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5346.4400000000005s)]
*  Who wants to be tainted? But by the way one of them and you can just beep out the name [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5352.04s)]
*  Was telling me it was the best thing because he ended up selling they already get the all-time highs to take the job [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5357.4800000000005s)]
*  He was like I gotta get out of all of this stuff. No, but listen, let me tell you the the ambassadorship [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5362.4400000000005s)]
*  It was a it was a smart trade by those guys because [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5366.4400000000005s)]
*  Ambassadors a lifetime title. So you're ambassador whatever no one remembers was president when you were ambassador [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5369.54s)]
*  No one cares. So you are going for the ambassador. So state I think it's fair to say [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5375.64s)]
*  I'm not interested in ceremonial things. I'm interested in making an impact [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5379.639999999999s)]
*  And the problem with all these positions, I mean being a cabinet official is not much different than being an ambassador [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5386.12s)]
*  So you're gonna you're gonna enlist in the navy [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5393.48s)]
*  No, what what would what has a bigger impact? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5396.759999999999s)]
*  Being on all in pod being an ambassador who's more influential? [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5399.799999999999s)]
*  sax on the all in pod or beep as the ambassador of sweden [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5404.28s)]
*  Being on pod actually all in pod is more [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5408.44s)]
*  Impactful by the way [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5412.5s)]
*  This is why I take issue with your statement about the term mainstream media because I think [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5413.56s)]
*  You have become the mainstream media more than most of the folks that know we're independent media. We're independent. Trust me [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5417.8s)]
*  It's independent. This thing's hanging on my thread [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5423.56s)]
*  And stop genuflecting [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5426.2s)]
*  No, it's independent we [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5429.16s)]
*  Who knows if this thing's gonna last another three episodes. I just like saying the word genuine. I know you like genuflecting. I know [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5431.24s)]
*  That is the top word of 2023 so far for me [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5437.32s)]
*  Oh is that is somebody doing an analysis with chadjpt of the words used here? [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5440.28s)]
*  No, but sax brought that word up. It was just it's a wonderful word. It's it's not used enough [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5444.44s)]

*  What you're [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiMTRQXBol0&t=5498.92s)]
