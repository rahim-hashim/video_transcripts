# E115 The AI Search Wars Google vs. Microsoft, Nordstream report, State of the Union
**All In Podcast:** [February 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs)
*  I had this thing with my oldest son where I don't know if it's all kids but he's 13. He doesn't know [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=0.0s)]
*  how to answer the phone, not to save his life. Oh, oh, he picks up the phone. Huh, hello. And so, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6.24s)]
*  and so I said, listen, from now on, when you call me, I expect a certain way that you pick up the [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=12.56s)]
*  phone. And that's going to be practiced for you how you interact with anybody else. And vice versa [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  as well. If I call you, you have to pick up the phone. And if you don't, I'm hanging up right away. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=23.12s)]
*  So yesterday, he calls me. And, and I'm like, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=27.6s)]
*  Hello, Chamath speaking. You know, it's like, hello, Chamath speaking. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=31.04s)]
*  Dad. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=35.84s)]
*  He calls back. Hello, Chamath speaking. Dad. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Hung up again. We did this three more fucking times. And then finally I said, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=48.0s)]
*  when will you get it through your head? Can you please just answer like if I say hello, Chamath [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=52.32s)]
*  speaking? Hey, Dad, it's your son or Hey, Dad, it's and it's unbelievable. And he's like, well, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=56.32s)]
*  none of my friends pick up the phone like this. And I'm like, Oh, my God, like, don't they think [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=62.8s)]
*  they need to have verbal communication skills? It's unbelievable. And then when I call him, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=66.56s)]
*  he picks up the phone. Oh, what? Not even Hello. Huh? What is that? It's like a grunt. Minimal [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=72.8s)]
*  effort. It's like the minimum number of syllables. It's embarrassing. Are you kids like this? Or is [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=81.52s)]
*  it just my kid? Actually, I don't think I've heard him pick up the phone. I need to test that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=87.44s)]
*  I'm going to let your winners ride. Rain man, David. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=91.04s)]
*  J Cal was on Twitter calling me out for not denouncing the Chinese balloon is strong enough [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=109.92s)]
*  language. Although I don't think he understood the language I was using. Did you understand what the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=114.64000000000001s)]
*  word errant means? What did you think it meant? I you know, I do understand the word errant. Yeah, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=119.28s)]
*  generally means straying off course. Yeah, and traveling in search of adventure, at least according [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=125.12s)]
*  to Merriam-Webster. So I just thought maybe you're being a little but I know you're a dove. So but it [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=132.72s)]
*  was a little doveish thinking they were just off course. I think you'd think they were off course, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=138.72s)]
*  or they were doing it deliberately. You buy that it was off course. Jenuflect, go Jenuflect, go, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=142.72s)]
*  go, go. So I knew Jake, how would have to join in this nationwide panic over this balloon. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=148.24s)]
*  I have no panic over it. Just the word errant means that a manolta camera touched to it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=155.36s)]
*  Jake, I got some really bad news for you. There are these things called spy satellites. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=163.36s)]
*  No, we know about those. And they can see everything. Oh, I know the it's obvious people, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  they've been sending these balloons over here for a while. I just thought you're framing as it was [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  errant. As in it like, well, of course, do you think it was? I'm sincerely asking, do you think [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=175.36s)]
*  it was errant? It was an accident? It's such a harebrained scheme to send a balloon flying over [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  American territory, that the Occam's razor explanation here is that they somehow lost [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  control over it. And these things are not steerable. So like, my guess is that it probably [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=193.84s)]
*  wasn't deliberate just because of how stupid a plan it would be. And how like obvious it would be. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=199.84s)]
*  But it could be I don't really know. What I do know is that the whole nation got in a lather [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=207.6s)]
*  and a tizzy and sort of hyperventilating about this balloon. And it just shows how reflexively [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=213.28s)]
*  hawkish the media is, you know, it's like, hey, can we just wrap up this war in Ukraine before we [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=218.32s)]
*  start another war with an even more formidable media superpower? The balloon got more intention [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=222.32s)]
*  than us blowing up Nord Stream. Exactly. Okay, well, hold on. No, what I would say about that is [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=228.8s)]
*  the media insight is the valid one. I was just responding to the errand. And I was curious if [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=234.96s)]
*  you actually thought it was an accident. I don't think it's an accident. I don't think there are [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=238.8s)]
*  Well, I think it clearly was off course and problematic. So you know, I don't know about [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  the intentionality of it. I, I think I think it very well could have been intentional. But I [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=246.72000000000003s)]
*  tend to think because it's such a stupid harebrained scheme. Like I almost given the benefit of the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=251.28s)]
*  doubt, not because they're not capable of spying. I'm sure they're spying on us. Obviously, they're [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=256.48s)]
*  spying on us. Just like we're spying on them. That's what we both do. But I seems like such a [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=260.8s)]
*  stupid way. Because you're gonna get caught. It's a made for TV moment. You have to understand the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=265.76s)]
*  nature of live television and why the media overreacted to it. It's ongoing. So because it's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=270.56s)]
*  not final, it's like a live event occurring, like when kids are trapped in a mine. Those are the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=276.8s)]
*  best stories for CNN, because you can keep updating people and people keep turning the TV on [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=283.44s)]
*  to check on the status. So this one was just made for CNN, because obviously, we're going to shoot [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=288.32s)]
*  the thing down. And obviously, you can interpret into it if it's an accident or not. And it just [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=294.24s)]
*  gives them something to talk about on a slow newsweek. But it is interesting. I think your [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=299.04s)]
*  point that is interesting is, is the Nord Stream story correct or not? Why is that not being [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=302.96s)]
*  covered? It's not being covered. Because there it's not an ongoing story. So that just shows you [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=309.76s)]
*  No, I don't think that's right. I think it's not being covered. Because the mainstream media [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=317.28s)]
*  already took a side on this. So remember, yeah, well, it's not it's not just cynical. So when [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=321.36s)]
*  when Nord Stream got blown up, the administration came racing out with the line that the Russians [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=328.32s)]
*  did it that they this was self sabotage. And by the way, the media repeated this endlessly. This [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=334.32s)]
*  was the media line. And it never really made sense to anyone who's paying attention because [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=339.12s)]
*  first of all, this was an economically vital asset to Russia. Second, it was their main source [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=343.6s)]
*  of leverage over Europe was their control over the gas supply. So the idea that they would shoot [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=349.6s)]
*  themselves in the foot that way, just to somehow what show how crazy they are, it never really [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=355.52s)]
*  made sense to anyone who's paying attention. And the fact that the administration, the media [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=362.08s)]
*  so quickly raced to that conclusion, suggested that it was maybe a cover story. Because if we [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=366.8s)]
*  had nothing to do with it, you would just be more neutral and say, Yeah, we don't know what happened. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=372.72s)]
*  But they had to like, promote this line that the Russians did it, which just never made any sense. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  And now Cy Hirsch has come out with this story. So it laying out in great detail how we did it. It's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=382.96000000000004s)]
*  not just saying we did it. It's laying out who did it and how and the steps and all that kind of stuff. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=388.32000000000005s)]
*  And just so you guys understand who this guy is, he's this legendary [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=393.52s)]
*  Pulitzer Prize winning journalist. He's like 86 years old or something like that now. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=396.96s)]
*  But he broke during Vietnam, he broke the story of the Mealy massacre, which the military denied [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=401.2s)]
*  until he proved it. He broke the story during the Iraq war of the Abu Ghraib prison abuses, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=407.68s)]
*  which again, the media, the military denied until it was undeniable. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=413.68s)]
*  His Pulitzer winning is all you really need to know. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=418.79999999999995s)]
*  Here he is breaking basically another covert military action. And look, we don't know for [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=420.8s)]
*  sure whether it's true or not. But it looks it looks pretty bad. Do you think that Europe knew? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=427.2s)]
*  Do you think that the Europeans were told that the Americans were going to go and blow this thing up? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=432.40000000000003s)]
*  If that's true, by the way, the administration has said clearly, this is a false story. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=436.88s)]
*  They said it was pure fiction. I think the specific quote was this is pure fiction. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=440.96000000000004s)]
*  The Ukraine would be the most likely person to do this. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  You got to look for means, motive and opportunity. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=448.96s)]
*  They don't have the opportunity to go down there and place a box. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=451.12s)]
*  I don't think the Ukrainians have the capability to do an undersea mission like that. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=454.32s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=459.35999999999996s)]
*  The Norwegians do. And the story maintained that we did it with them. The British do. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=459.84s)]
*  Story didn't say whether they were involved or not. So no, my guess is that if this was a covert [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  US activity, it was kept to a very small group, which is why it'll be hard to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=471.44s)]
*  prove more definitively than this. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=477.12s)]
*  The other side of the argument is this is such a provocation [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=478.56s)]
*  and the administration saying it's fiction. So what is your response to that, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=482.96s)]
*  Zach? Would the US do something so provocative or would they have somebody else do it? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=487.68s)]
*  And would Norway do something so provocative? It seems like an extremely offensive technique [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=492.56s)]
*  as opposed to just backing the Ukraine to defend itself against Russia's invasion. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=499.76s)]
*  Here's the thing. Before the invasion, Biden at a press conference said that if [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=504.0s)]
*  the Russians invade, Nord Stream would be no more. And they asked him, well, how can you [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=508.56s)]
*  make sure that that's a deal between Germany and Russia? We're not involved. And he said, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=514.72s)]
*  we have ways. We have ways. Just trust me, it'll happen. Separately, Victoria Newland, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=518.8s)]
*  who's our Deputy Secretary of State, said something very similar about how we would [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=522.88s)]
*  stop Nord Stream if the Russians invaded. And then after Nord Stream got blown up, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=527.28s)]
*  Blinken at a press conference said that this was a wonderful opportunity [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=533.2s)]
*  and was extolling all the benefits of this. And then Victoria Newland at a congressional hearing [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=536.8s)]
*  said that I'm sure we're all very glad that it's a hunk of metal at the bottom of the sea, again, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=541.3599999999999s)]
*  extolling all the benefits. And we've discussed the benefits on this program of now we've shifted [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=544.4s)]
*  the European dependence on Russian gas to a dependence on American gas. So the fact of the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=549.1999999999999s)]
*  matter is the administration kind of telegraphed what they were going to do. They had the capability [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=554.88s)]
*  to do it and they had the motive to do it. So it's certainly a plausible story. You're right that we [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=560.16s)]
*  can't know for sure. It's a single source story that depends on the credibility of Cy Hirsch. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=566.08s)]
*  But as it stands right now, whose story do I think makes more sense? Probably Cy Hirsch's. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=574.08s)]
*  You believe Cy Hirsch over the spokesperson for the CIA who wrote, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  the claim is completely and utterly false. Just to be clear. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, these same people denied Abu Ghraib. They denied Milai. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=586.5600000000001s)]
*  To be clear, you believe that? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=590.24s)]
*  They deny everything. They deny that NATO expansion had anything to do with the, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=591.6s)]
*  you know, breakout of this war. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=597.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is one of the situations where we can't possibly know. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=598.96s)]
*  Yeah, you make a good point, J. Cal, which is this, if true, and look, I'm not saying I don't know if [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=602.6400000000001s)]
*  it's- You're leaning towards believing it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=608.08s)]
*  I lean towards thinking it's more plausible than not. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=610.08s)]
*  Because also like who else could have done it and who, again, who had the motive, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=613.36s)]
*  means an opportunity. But you make a great point, which is if we did it, it's an incredibly [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=616.96s)]
*  provocative act. It's basically perpetrating an act of war against a country that has thousands [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=622.72s)]
*  of nuclear weapons. Biden promised us at the beginning of this war that he would keep us out [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=628.4s)]
*  of being directly involved. So this would directly contradict what he said at the beginning of this [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=632.8s)]
*  war. So I think it's a very scary situation here. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=637.92s)]
*  Yeah, no. You've been pro de-escalation. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=643.76s)]
*  If the US didn't do it, like, why don't we find the real killer? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=645.52s)]
*  I actually have this. I have the theory. Here's my theory. The CIA knew how to do it. Biden wants [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=650.64s)]
*  to do it. The Republicans want to do it. Obviously, the people who are the most pro-stopping Nordstream [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=657.1999999999999s)]
*  have been the Republicans. They've led this charge even more than the Democrats. So it's a [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=661.92s)]
*  bipartisan issue. Stop Nordstream, bipartisan issue, hands down. I think the CIA probably knew [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=666.0s)]
*  how to do it. And just like we equipped the Ukraine to do it, we might have facilitated [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=671.92s)]
*  the Ukraine and a collaborator, UK, Norway, some freelancers. You know, we have those freelance [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=677.28s)]
*  former Navy SEALs that operate. Perhaps the CIA just said to the Ukraine, here's a, you know, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=685.5999999999999s)]
*  black ops group. If you wanted to engage them, you could feel free to do so, which would then [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=690.8s)]
*  split the difference between what Tsai is saying, what the CIA is saying, which is typically where [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=696.64s)]
*  the truth lies, is probably between what this investigative journalist of note has said and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=701.6s)]
*  what the CIA is denying. The CIA probably has plausible deniability. That's my prediction. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=707.6s)]
*  Well, if you could find a source for that story, J. Cal, that lays out in the same level of detail [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=712.4s)]
*  that Hirsch has laid out in terms of the meetings that occurred, what was approved when, how they [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=717.44s)]
*  did it, you know, when they did it, the explosives they used, the divers they used. It goes into a [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=722.88s)]
*  fair amount of detail. Incredible detail. Yeah. I mean, so I mean, you're laying out a theory. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=730.96s)]
*  Down to what explosives, right? But you're trying to put what you just said, which is basically you [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=735.6800000000001s)]
*  inventing a story on the same level as Hirsch's story. Yeah, I understand. But he actually has [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=739.84s)]
*  a lot of detail in his story. Yeah, he had umpteen sources. There was a lot of people that were [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=745.6s)]
*  willing to tell this story. No, no, I don't think that's actually the case. I don't think he has [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=751.2800000000001s)]
*  umpteen sources. And there's no, on the record, there's one main source. There was one main source, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=755.0400000000001s)]
*  but who provided a ton of detail. I don't know exactly how much he was able to directly [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=760.4s)]
*  corroborate with other sources. I don't know that. The other thing I wonder, Sachs, is he, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=764.4s)]
*  with this one source story, he has a collaboration with the New Yorker. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=769.84s)]
*  And anybody would, if this was a really well-sourced and you could back it up kind of story, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=774.16s)]
*  they would love to have the ratings for this story. This is a blockbuster story. Or as happens a long [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=780.4s)]
*  time, which we learned, was it through the Valerie Plame affair, which is that these major news [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=785.2s)]
*  publications will sometimes have a back channel back to the national security apparatus when they [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=790.5600000000001s)]
*  have something like this. And the message was, you can't hit print on this. Yeah, that's a possibility [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=795.9200000000001s)]
*  too. He goes and just self-publishes himself, which wasn't really even an option a few years ago. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=800.88s)]
*  No, yeah. So I mean, this is the raw shock test of raw shock test. You have the media, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=806.88s)]
*  you got the CIA. It's fodder for a great movie. What I go back to, J. Cal, is I think you can lay [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=811.68s)]
*  out some theories about, let's say, you know, the polls did it, or maybe Ukrainians with the British [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=816.0799999999999s)]
*  or something. Yes, you could lay out those theories, but the media wasn't willing to entertain any of [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=822.8s)]
*  those theories when this news broke. What did they do? They blamed the Russians. And that story made [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=828.2399999999999s)]
*  no sense, but they said it so definitively. I'm looking for the source on that. Nick, if you could [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=833.28s)]
*  pull up the source of the administration blaming the Russians. I just want to make sure we're [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=838.48s)]
*  accurate. Oh, Biden did it at a press conference. Yeah, I just want to make sure we actually have that. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=842.5600000000001s)]
*  He said it was an act of sabotage by the Russians. Now, they didn't push it that hard. What was [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=844.96s)]
*  interesting is the Biden administration set it, but they didn't keep coming back to it. But the media [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=849.04s)]
*  really ran with it. And when people on both the left and the right, like people like Jeffrey [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=853.76s)]
*  Sacks on the left and Tucker Carlson on the right, basically started to question whether the US could [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=859.44s)]
*  have done it. They were accused of being conspiracy theorists and, you know, Putin's stooges and all [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=863.12s)]
*  the rest of it. And now all of a sudden here comes Seymour Hersh with a pretty detailed story, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=867.84s)]
*  lending credence to that point of view. Yeah. It just may indicate we don't know everything [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  that's going on with this war. And I think the longer this goes on, the more dangerous it is. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=879.44s)]
*  Freberg, you have any thoughts on geopolitical issues and who might have blown up Nord Stream? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=886.5600000000001s)]
*  And what are your sources saying, Freberg? What are your sources and science quarters saying? [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=890.88s)]
*  Speculation is best left to the future. I don't know about the whole [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=897.4399999999999s)]
*  speculating on what could have been done in the past by someone. Those are conspiracy theories. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=901.68s)]
*  They're not actually conspiracy theories. Nord Stream was blown up. You understand that, right? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=908.16s)]
*  Like there's no doubt that it was blown up. No, I'm saying J. Cal's theory. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=913.2s)]
*  Oh yeah. J. Cal's theory is just a story with no evidence. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=916.56s)]
*  You've got to bring data to the table. Yeah, to their pure theory, pure speculation. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=918.72s)]
*  You've got to bring data to the table to make it up. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=922.64s)]
*  By the way, speaking of which, Radek Sikorski, who is a Polish diplomat, I think he was like [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=924.72s)]
*  their foreign minister, when Nord Stream blew up, he tweeted a photo of it saying, thank you, USA. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=930.64s)]
*  Which was one of the reasons why people thought that, okay, like, yeah, of course the US did it. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=938.96s)]
*  Who has the capability to do it? Who has the motive to do it? Who said they were going to do it? [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=944.08s)]
*  And who benefits? Ukraine. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=949.6800000000001s)]
*  Wee bono. Who benefits? Who was conducting NATO exercises in that region [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=951.0400000000001s)]
*  three months before the thing blew up. Yeah, exactly. And Jeffrey Sachs pointed [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=956.64s)]
*  that out on, I think it was a CNBC interview before they basically stopped him because he's [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=960.8000000000001s)]
*  not allowed to talk about this on network TV apparently. But he basically pointed out [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=965.6s)]
*  there were like US radar signatures in the area. President Joe Biden declared that, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=970.4000000000001s)]
*  this is from Bloomberg, that a massive leak from the Nord Stream gas pipeline system in the Baltic [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=974.1600000000001s)]
*  Sea was an intentional act and that the Russian statements about the incident shouldn't be [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=978.32s)]
*  trusted. It was a deliberate act of sabotage. And now the Russians are pumping out disinformation [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=981.44s)]
*  lies. Biden told reporters Friday at the White House. So he didn't exactly say the Russians did [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=985.2s)]
*  it. He just said it's an act of the Russians. What's that? The media did. You could do one [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=988.96s)]
*  of these montages where it was like Russian sabotage. In fact, good amount. But he just [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=993.7600000000001s)]
*  to be quick, Biden didn't say it was sabotage. He said it was an act of sabotage. If you actually [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=999.44s)]
*  look at what Biden said, everything he said is absolutely true if the US also did it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1003.2s)]
*  Correct. Every single sentence that Joe Biden said is 100% true, whether we did it or whether [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1008.48s)]
*  Russia did it. It was a deliberate act of sabotage in part of these bias. Think about it. If we did [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1017.6s)]
*  it, we know they didn't do it. And then we have to be like careful about suggesting they did it. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1024.16s)]
*  What are the Germans think because this is the Germans pipeline? So if we blew it up, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1030.08s)]
*  that's also an explain to me your thinking on the chessboard of our relationship with Germany. If [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1034.64s)]
*  we blew it up, would they not also see that as a hostile act? This is why I asked if Europe knew, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1041.2s)]
*  because I think you have to tell Germany that it's going to happen. And I think the quid pro quo [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1045.28s)]
*  with Germany is some amount of guaranteed supply that the US directs into Europe, [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1051.44s)]
*  so that they know that their long term LNG supply is intact, so that they become ambivalent. There's [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1057.2s)]
*  a point of indifference where the Germans say, okay, we don't know when this thing is going to [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1062.8s)]
*  get turned back on. And we don't know what the implications of it are. Here's what our demands [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1067.9199999999998s)]
*  are, meaning our energy supply, our energy needs are. And so as long as the United States can say, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1071.6799999999998s)]
*  look, worst case we have stuff in the SPR that we can give you, there's probably a point of [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1079.2s)]
*  indifference where the Germans say, okay, we're just going to turn around and not say anything. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1084.24s)]
*  And I'm curious, did the Germans say anything when this happened? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1087.52s)]
*  No, not that. I'm looking for the German. I was literally just typed to Nick, what was the [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1090.88s)]
*  German's position on this? Because that's interesting too. That's a tell. Well, yeah, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1095.04s)]
*  if you're breaking this down like a poker hand, who are trying to figure out if you construct [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1098.32s)]
*  this hand, right? Preflop, it's like, you know, where both of these folks are. Right? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1102.72s)]
*  Okay, there was a really interesting video that a guy named Matt or failure who puts together these [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1107.36s)]
*  really funny videos that he put together these montages of media reactions to things. And what [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1113.6s)]
*  he shows is that, you know, you can have like 20 different media outlets and they all use the exact [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1119.52s)]
*  same words. And when he clips it together, you can see the reading from somebody's talking points. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1123.6s)]
*  And it's not really clear who and basically, if you look at his video here, on who blew up [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1129.36s)]
*  Nord Stream pipeline, you see that there was like a party line from the mainstream media on the stuff [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1134.56s)]
*  Nord Stream to we will bring it into it. But how will you how will you do that? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1140.1599999999999s)]
*  I promise you we'll be able to do that. Nord Stream pipeline. I mean, we have to conclude [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1147.12s)]
*  that it's most likely Russia, Russian sabotage on its own infrastructure, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1156.56s)]
*  the common sense matter. I think it's Putin's way of sending a message. What Putin is saying to us [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1161.36s)]
*  by blowing up the pipeline is, look, I can blow up a pipeline. Everyone knows that Putin did this [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1166.32s)]
*  himself. Are these talking smoking gun without the direct proof? Yeah, I think logic and common sense [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1170.8s)]
*  will tell you that without the evidence, Russia was behind the incident. For sure. Who sabotaged the [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1176.6399999999999s)]
*  Nord Stream to pipeline? This nonsense. Come on. That's hysterical. You know, it's these talking [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1182.3999999999999s)]
*  heads who have no firsthand experience. Fantastic. Fantastic. It's fantastic. It's fantastic. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1188.1599999999999s)]
*  All his videos are like that where he has one on the 100 Biden laptop as well, where again, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1194.08s)]
*  he's got like 20 different talking heads and media outlets, all portraying it in exactly the same [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1199.12s)]
*  language. And it is not how this works. There's a narrative on Sunday morning shows, you hear the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1205.52s)]
*  same narrative from each side. How does that actually get coordinated? Each side builds those [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1212.08s)]
*  bullet points, emails their what do they call them? surrogates. They email all the surrogates and say, [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1217.04s)]
*  just keep saying these things over and over again, to codify. That's a WhatsApp group. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1222.96s)]
*  It's a WhatsApp group. And they're just like, say this over and over again. How does it work, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1228.08s)]
*  sex? I think it's partly talking points, memos that go out to chat groups. I think it's also [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1232.08s)]
*  just people looking on Twitter. And then there's like certain key nodes that they follow. And they [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1236.56s)]
*  know, okay, this is the party line, because such and such key person is saying it. And they take [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1242.24s)]
*  their cues. That mnemonic mnemonic effect that you guys always talk about people with each [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1246.64s)]
*  mnemonic. Yeah, the thing to understand is that all the prestige outlets repeat the same party [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1252.96s)]
*  line and have the same perspective. Yeah. You got it. You got to do your own search for information. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1258.3999999999999s)]
*  This is the beauty of substack. Actually, this is why substack is so important is it actually gives [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1263.6s)]
*  you disruptive. Yeah, it's pretty disruptive. Because like you've got 10 different mainstream [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1267.12s)]
*  media networks or newspapers and magazines, but they all have exactly the same talking points, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1273.6s)]
*  except maybe Fox News is kind of the one exception. Although even Fox on the whole Nord Stream thing, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1277.36s)]
*  you saw that Fox can be pretty militaristic. And they had the same generals basically blaming [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1282.48s)]
*  the Russians for this on Fox. Yeah, Germany's position is just, hey, everybody. This is sabotage. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1288.24s)]
*  So that's it. But who did this sabotage? I think you asked a really good question there about the [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1294.56s)]
*  German interest in this. Right now, the German economic interest and the German foreign policy [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1299.2s)]
*  interests are not aligned. What's clearly best for the German economy is to have cheap natural gas [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1305.2s)]
*  powering its industries, even if it comes from Russian pipelines. And they no longer have that [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1310.88s)]
*  anymore. In fact, they may never have that again. So they're going to pay a very high price economically, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1317.6000000000001s)]
*  maybe forever. And remember, their whole economy is based on industry. They're very industrial [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1322.48s)]
*  power. So if this war drags on for a long time, I think Schultz might be in some political trouble, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1327.92s)]
*  precisely because he's gone along with the Americans on this. And there is a growing political [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1333.2s)]
*  opposition to this war inside of Germany. War fatigue is a real thing. And this thing's got to [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1339.84s)]
*  wrap up at some point. Any final thoughts, Friedberg? I know you didn't get too involved [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1345.76s)]
*  in that conversation. But what is any game theory from you? No. Okay, there you have it, folks. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1349.6799999999998s)]
*  Sultan of Science checking in. What's the problem? You don't want to criticize the establishment? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1360.48s)]
*  Voting for Sachs? It's always been very personal with Sachs. You predicted. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1364.16s)]
*  Why don't you have my position on this? Is it because- [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1369.28s)]
*  No, I'm just trying to understand because- I don't think anyone has- I'm not pro-establishment. I [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1372.08s)]
*  think you know that. I'm just analytical around the fact that I think there's a strong orientation [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1376.32s)]
*  towards conflict. And I think there still is. I don't think that there's much of an incentive [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1380.6399999999999s)]
*  or a motivation to back down because this conflict creates a significant amount of debt owed back to [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1384.8s)]
*  the US. It creates a potential future asset stream. It creates a realignment of power. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1391.28s)]
*  Everyone's looking externally as internal economic conflict and wealth disparity issues arise. And [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1397.84s)]
*  economic growth is challenged and inflation is soaring. It's a great place to address one's [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1405.68s)]
*  energy. So I think all of this stuff is detailed analytical shenanigans around who's saying what [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1411.76s)]
*  or who's doing what. I think the underlying thesis and the underlying river that's flowing [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1417.6s)]
*  is one that's looking for external conflict. I think the same is true with the US and China. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1422.9599999999998s)]
*  And I think- You're talking about the military industrial complex [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1428.24s)]
*  is going to benefit massively from this. The longer this drags out, the more the conflict in [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1431.1999999999998s)]
*  Taiwan heats up, the more we're going to invest in our military. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1436.6399999999999s)]
*  We often talk about these things as if they're top-down, master plan driven. And as we all know, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1440.9599999999998s)]
*  they're more Ouija board driven. It's a bunch of guys that got their hand on the Ouija board [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1447.6s)]
*  and they're all just had a little too much caffeine. And in this case, I think it's just [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1451.76s)]
*  more about like, everyone's a little anxious and the anxiety's leading to a desire for more [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1456.3999999999999s)]
*  conflict. We're not happy at home. If you're happy at home, you're not looking externally for conflict. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1462.48s)]
*  That's true in nearly every developed nation on earth today. That's it. I don't know. Pretty [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1466.8s)]
*  simple. I like your position. I think it's a great take. I think it's a great take. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1473.1999999999998s)]
*  I think there are a lot of interests who benefit from war. And I think the foreign policy [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1476.96s)]
*  establishment is funded by those interests. And it's kind of wired for war, at least in terms of [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1481.84s)]
*  the reflex, right? Even something as relatively harmless as a balloon. That becomes like a casus [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1487.68s)]
*  bella. It's like people are ready to go to war against China over that. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1494.72s)]
*  I saw a couple of military leaders give a talk a few months ago. It's in a private thing. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1498.48s)]
*  So it wasn't on public record with the establishment? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1503.76s)]
*  No, yeah, I was at the establishment gathering. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1506.96s)]
*  Where the establishment gets together. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1508.96s)]
*  Did you genuflect twice going in? Because that's the tradition. You do one genuflect on each knee, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1510.8s)]
*  then they give you the bag of capitalism. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1515.52s)]
*  Did you guys see my pen on my lapel? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1517.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1520.24s)]
*  What was striking to me in this particular thing where these guys were being interviewed on stage [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1521.12s)]
*  at a dinner thing. And they were so oriented around their next steps in escalation. And I [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1526.0s)]
*  think it speaks to the point, Zach. None of them were thinking about where are we at today? How do [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1535.68s)]
*  we deescalate? What is this going to get? There was no conversation at all from anyone about [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1541.6s)]
*  resolution or deescalation. With every single one of them, it was all about my orientation [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1546.08s)]
*  for getting bigger, going deeper, going harder, going stronger, making this thing bigger. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1552.16s)]
*  And I think that was really scary to me, because I didn't hear anyone having a conversation around [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1556.64s)]
*  like how do we, should we even consider whether or not this doesn't get bigger? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1561.28s)]
*  Everyone was thinking assumptively it was going to get bigger. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1565.6000000000001s)]
*  I like the Ouija board. You have to follow the financial incentives. When the last time we [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1568.88s)]
*  looked at this, right? Leon Panetta and all these other guys who were screaming for war, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1572.64s)]
*  they were getting paid by the military industrial complex. I remember when Lloyd Austin was [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1577.2s)]
*  nominated as defense secretary, he had some conflict issues because he was just on the [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1581.6s)]
*  board of Northrop Grumman or one of these big military industrial companies. And so of course, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1586.24s)]
*  these generals have to push for war because as long as they're girding for war, they're guaranteed [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1591.6s)]
*  to have for them a very lucrative job once they leave the military. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1596.3999999999999s)]
*  The Ouija board though, Zach, I'll throw it to you. Maybe you can keep this metaphor going. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1602.56s)]
*  The media has got their hands on it. They want ratings. You have the energy industrial complex [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1607.28s)]
*  in this German conflict who seeks to benefit massively if people invest in renewables, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1611.6s)]
*  or you find other oil off Norway. Norway's oil is one of the largest reserves that's untapped. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1616.6399999999999s)]
*  So you have this Ouija board, media, energy, and the military industrial complex all moving [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1624.08s)]
*  it at once. Maybe you can speak to that analogy. That's right. And everyone wants to move it to [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1629.12s)]
*  the side of the Ouija board that says escalate. There are very few people that have the energy [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1631.84s)]
*  to move it to the other side that says deescalate. It's not profitable. Deescalation means less energy, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1636.16s)]
*  more less investment. So yeah, we're going to go escalate. You know who warned us about the military [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1640.96s)]
*  industrial complex? Yes. Dwight Eisenhower, supreme mile like commander in World War II, wins the war, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1645.6000000000001s)]
*  patriot war hero, top general, becomes president, Republican president. And his departing address [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1651.76s)]
*  warns us that yes, we need a defense industry, but they become a vested interest in favor of [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1658.16s)]
*  foreign interventions of war. And where's the interest on the other side of it? I can tell you [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1664.96s)]
*  this. The American people don't want to be in a war with Russia. I don't even think most of the [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1672.96s)]
*  American people want to send a hundred billion over there. They want to send a hundred billion [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1677.2800000000002s)]
*  to their cities to fix crime and all the other problems. Yeah. Homelessness, everything. Yeah. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1682.24s)]
*  If you've never seen that farewell address from 1961, it is well worth watching. You can find it [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1687.3600000000001s)]
*  on YouTube. Just search for military industrial complex Eisenhower. And he, and this is a person [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1691.68s)]
*  who was part of the military industrial complex saying, watch out for this. It was a very [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1696.88s)]
*  pressing warning. Yes. He was in the machine. He helped build the machine. Welcome to the [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1701.44s)]
*  All In Podcast with us again, David the Dove's Axe, Chamath Palihapitiya and the Sultan of Science [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1706.72s)]
*  who was on his podcast. Oh my God. So many podcasts you're doing. The Sultan of Science is in [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1713.1200000000001s)]
*  hot demand. What are all these podcasts you're doing, Freeberg? All these science podcasts [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1718.08s)]
*  pulling you in. I did a podcast with Brian Keating last week who was really kind enough [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1721.84s)]
*  to reach out. He's had some awesome guests. He's a cosmologist at UCSD professor down there. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1725.9199999999998s)]
*  And we were supposed to record that day and then we canceled, I think last minute, right? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1733.84s)]
*  Yeah. I was only supposed to be on with him for an hour and I'm like, oh, well, my next thing just [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1737.84s)]
*  got freed up. So ended up doing like three hours. It was, I was so, I was like exhausted that day. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1741.04s)]
*  So I look really hungover on the video and probably par for the course. Yeah. But no Lex [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1746.8s)]
*  Friedman for you. So Chamath and I have done Friedman, Lex Friedman, but you have not. He's [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1752.24s)]
*  he invited you yet Lex? Has Lex invited you? No, no, he's not. Where's my invitation? Where's my [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1756.1599999999999s)]
*  invitation? I don't know what's going on here. Collect all four Lex. What are you doing? All [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1761.44s)]
*  right. No Davos and no Lex Friedman. Well, yeah. What's going on? You would never. Anti-establishment? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1765.04s)]
*  What's going on? No, I'm too anti-establishment, that's, you know, you've mischaracterized me. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1770.08s)]
*  Nobody, nobody's inviting this quartet to anything. We're not doing all in live from Davos. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1775.28s)]
*  It's not happening folks. Sorry. They don't have that heat. I agree. I'm with Alja Marks. I don't [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1783.2s)]
*  want to be part of any club that would have me as a member. Absolutely. And they also don't want [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1788.72s)]
*  you there anyway. So yeah, it's, it works out for everybody. It does fill me with like a rage where [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1792.3999999999999s)]
*  I actually might agree to doing the all in summit again. By the way, proposal coming your way this [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1798.6399999999999s)]
*  weekend. If you want to really, really, really from your nose at the establishment. Yes, let's [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1805.04s)]
*  do it. Set it during the exact same dates and times as an establishment conference. Oh, the [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1809.12s)]
*  alt Davos. And then invite all the best guests so that they are, they come to ours. Just a suggestion. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1815.84s)]
*  Force them to choose alt Ted. Ted's not going to live in there. You know how vanity fares of their new establishment conference? You could call it the [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1820.0s)]
*  anti-establishment. Oh, that's a tagline. Let's come up with a tagline that just tweaks everybody. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1825.6s)]
*  And then we should create a list. We should create the anti list. You know, they have their like [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1831.12s)]
*  establishment list. We should have the anti list. That's a good point. I like the anti establishment. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1835.36s)]
*  Start with them. I have a great vanity fair establishment thing story. Okay, I snuck on that [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1840.32s)]
*  list. They put me on that list a decade ago. Let's pull it. Let me find a link. Go on. Keep [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1848.2399999999998s)]
*  and the most incredible thing about it is that when you go to the event, which was kind of [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1852.56s)]
*  a cool event, we all had photos taken by Annie Leibovitz. Oh, and I have a montage [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1857.12s)]
*  of some of the people that took photos that day. That's pretty cool. Me, Aaron Levy, Priscilla Chan, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1864.3999999999999s)]
*  Bezos, bunch of people. But I was about to say this before you had this when you had the dad bod and [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1871.84s)]
*  no fashion sense. Yeah, it was like, yeah, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1878.32s)]
*  Oh, look, he looks great. Here it is. I just basically had no stylist. It was like a year or [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1880.96s)]
*  two post Facebook. It was not a good look for me. Yeah, but that's not that picture. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1890.32s)]
*  Is that Tom Ford? That was your Tom Ford face. He's doing the jeans blazer thing, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1895.9199999999998s)]
*  which is like a really tired look for a silk and jowl. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1900.96s)]
*  Free skinny jeans, though. It was like a little loose. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1903.92s)]
*  Free skinny jeans. Yeah. That was in 2011. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1905.68s)]
*  2012. That's not so bad. Just don't pull up the Chamath pictures when he's wearing like, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1910.4s)]
*  Oh my God, his Macy's shirt. If you do the Google search, you put the images before 2011, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1915.2s)]
*  you will find Chamath photos. Dude, at Facebook, I wear the same thing every day for four years, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1921.2s)]
*  five years is brutal. Oh, my God. What is that? That's also Tom Ford. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1927.44s)]
*  We got to break this down. Yeah. See, this is when the sweater game was not tight. This is like [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1934.4s)]
*  sweater 1.0 game. I didn't know what I was doing back then. Stop, put these pictures off, please. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1938.88s)]
*  Look, he's also got the watch subtly peeking out. This is back when he was like, Oh, I got a Rolex. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1943.52s)]
*  That's a potential, but anyways, yeah. This is when the watch is rolling. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1948.88s)]
*  At a zero. I don't know if that watch got to six or two, but yeah, same story. Same, same, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1954.24s)]
*  Jake. Same, same, same. All right. Well, listen, I got an Apple watch and I'm going to, oh, geez. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1959.76s)]
*  That's the dad vibes. Wow. That must have been from, yeah, 13, 14 years ago. Wow. God, you had [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1966.16s)]
*  no style. I really didn't. It was rough. I really did. It's rough. I mean, don't pull up pictures [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1977.6s)]
*  of me. I was fat. Yeah. Pictures of me eating egg sandwiches all over the internet. Oh yeah. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1982.88s)]
*  Chubby J Cal. Oh man. Look at that face. There he is. That's plus 20 pounds. Let's keep this [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1987.3600000000001s)]
*  going. Search wars, Microsoft versus Google. Okay. It's been a rough couple of days for Google. We've [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1992.88s)]
*  all seen it. Google and Microsoft both did live demos of their new generative AI, yada, yada, yada. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=1997.6000000000001s)]
*  You guys all know about chat GPT, but now Bing is integrating it into their search engine, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2003.3600000000001s)]
*  getting there before Google and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. He is going ham. He looks great. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2007.84s)]
*  He's fit. He's wearing a tight t-shirt and he is saying he's going to make Google dance, dance, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2015.76s)]
*  Google dance. He is getting up in their business and listen, he is in a distant second place. So [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2021.1999999999998s)]
*  it makes sense. On the other hand, Google's AI demo was frankly a bit of a disaster, poorly [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2027.4399999999998s)]
*  received stock. They dropped 12% since this event and their presentation did not include the chat [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2034.64s)]
*  that Bard because in search, because it wasn't working, it seems like there was an error in it [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2041.92s)]
*  when they said, what new discoveries from the James Webb space telescope can I tell my nine [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2047.1200000000001s)]
*  year old and Bard answered that it took the first pictures of a planet outside our solar system, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2052.08s)]
*  which is false, which of course we all know about chat GPT. It's only right half the time. And it's [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2057.2000000000003s)]
*  a little woke on the margins. So anyway, there was a screenshot circulating today, which is [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2063.44s)]
*  probably false. But it says the following me and a bunch of coworkers were just laid off from Google [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2071.68s)]
*  for AI demo going wrong. It was a team of 168 people who prepared the slides for the demo, all [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2077.36s)]
*  of us are out of jobs. I can't imagine that's real. But if it was, that would be a hardcore [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2081.84s)]
*  moment for Google to fire a bunch of people for screwing it up. Listen, you worked in the belly [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2086.32s)]
*  of the beast free bird, what are your thoughts on being poking the tiger and telling Google dance? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2091.44s)]
*  You know, Sundar dance, you know, what's interesting is Google's had like an incredible [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2098.96s)]
*  AI competency, particularly since they bought deep mind. And it's been predominantly oriented towards [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2104.16s)]
*  kind of, you know, internal problems. You know, they're they demonstrated last year that their [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2110.56s)]
*  AI improved data center energy efficiency by 40%. They've used it for ad optimization, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2117.04s)]
*  ad copy optimization, the YouTube follow video algorithm. So what video is suggested to you [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2122.56s)]
*  as your next video to watch, which massively increased YouTube hours watched per user, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2129.2799999999997s)]
*  which massively increased YouTube revenue. You know, what's the right time and place to insert [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2135.44s)]
*  videos in YouTube or insert ads and YouTube videos. So, you know, auto fill in Gmail and Doc. So [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2140.4s)]
*  so much of this competency has been oriented specifically to avoid this primary disruption [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2145.84s)]
*  and search. Obviously, now, things have come to a bit of a point because, you know, this alternative [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2151.44s)]
*  for search has been revealed in chat GPT. And you guys can kind of think about search and you know, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2158.1600000000003s)]
*  we've used this term in the past, Larry and Sergey, the textbook that they read, you know, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2164.4s)]
*  one of the original textbooks that's used in internet search engine technology is called [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2169.36s)]
*  information retrieval, information retrieval. So information retrieval is this idea that you know, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2174.0s)]
*  how do you pull data from a static data set, and it involves scanning that data set or crawling it, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2178.48s)]
*  and then creating an index against it, and then a ranking model for how do you pull stuff out of the [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2185.36s)]
*  index to present the results from the data that's available based on what it is you're querying for, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2189.36s)]
*  you know, and doing that all in a tenth of a second. So, you know, if you think about the [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2196.16s)]
*  information retrieval problem, you type in the data or some rough estimation of the data you want to [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2200.3999999999996s)]
*  pull up, and then a list is presented to you. And over time, Google realized, hey, we could show that [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2205.8399999999997s)]
*  data in smarter, quicker ways. Like if we can identify that you're looking for a very specific [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2211.04s)]
*  answer, we can reveal that answer in the one box, which is the thing that sits above the search [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2215.68s)]
*  results. Like if you said, what time is it? You know, what when does this movie show at this theater? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2219.52s)]
*  So they can pull out the structured data and give you a very specific answer rather than a list from [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2224.7999999999997s)]
*  the database. And then over time, there were other kind of modalities for displaying data that it [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2229.2799999999997s)]
*  turns out were even better than the list, like maps, or shopping, where you can kind of see a [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2235.2799999999997s)]
*  matrix of results, or YouTube, where you can see a, you know, longer form version of content. And so [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2240.88s)]
*  these different kind of, you know, information retrieval, you know, media were presented to you, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2246.64s)]
*  and it really kind of changed the game and created much better user satisfaction in terms of getting [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2252.96s)]
*  what they were looking for. The challenge with with this new modality is it's not really fully [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2258.48s)]
*  encompassing. So if you can kind of think about the human computer interaction problem, you want to [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2265.84s)]
*  see flight times, and airlines, and the price of flights in a matrix, you don't necessarily want [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2271.36s)]
*  a text stream written to you to give you the, you know, the answer that you're looking for, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2278.08s)]
*  or you want to see a visual display of shopping results, or you do want to see a bunch of different [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2283.8399999999997s)]
*  people's commentary, because you're looking for different points of view on a topic, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2290.24s)]
*  rather than just get an answer. But there are certainly a bunch of answer solutions for which [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2293.92s)]
*  chat dpt type, you know, natural language responsiveness becomes a fantastic and better [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2298.48s)]
*  mode to present answers to you than the matrix or the list or the ranking and so on. Now, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2305.68s)]
*  the one thing that I think is worth noting, I did a back of the envelope analysis on the cost [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2311.44s)]
*  of doing this compared to chat GPT. So, so Google makes about three bucks per click, you can back [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2316.64s)]
*  into what the revenue per search is a bunch of different ways. One way is three bucks per click, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2321.6s)]
*  about a 3% click through rate on ads. Some people estimate this is about right about five cents to [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2326.0s)]
*  10 cents revenue per search done on Google or anywhere from one cent to 10 cents. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2330.32s)]
*  Even if they don't click the ads, because one out of 100 people click an ad, and that's where the [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2334.88s)]
*  money comes from. So let's just call it five cents, right? And you can assume a roughly 50% margin [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2338.96s)]
*  on that search, which means a 50% cogs or cost of goods, or a cost to run that search and present [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2344.96s)]
*  those ads. So you know, right now, Google search costs them about, you know, call it two and a half [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2350.48s)]
*  cents per search to present the results. A recent estimate on running the GPT three model [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2356.8s)]
*  for chat GPT is that each result takes about 30 cents of compute. So it's about an order of [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2364.88s)]
*  magnitude higher cost to run that search result than it is to do it through a traditional search [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2372.1600000000003s)]
*  query today, which makes today today. That's right. And so, so that's the point, like it has [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2379.1200000000003s)]
*  to come down by about an order of magnitude. Now, this is a this then becomes a very deep [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2384.24s)]
*  technical discussion that I'm certainly not the expert, but there are a lot of great experts that [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2390.64s)]
*  there's great blogs and sub stacks on this on what's it going to take to get there to get a 10x [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2394.8799999999997s)]
*  reduction in cost on running these models. And there's a lot related to kind of optimization [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2399.12s)]
*  on how you run them on a compute platform, the type of compute hardware that's being used all [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2404.8799999999997s)]
*  the way down to the chips that are being used. So there's still quite a lot of work to go. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2409.6s)]
*  Before this becomes truly economically competitive with Google, and that really matters, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2414.4799999999996s)]
*  because if you get to the scale of Google, you're talking about spending eight to $20 billion [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2419.9199999999996s)]
*  a quarter just to run search results and display them. And so for chat GPT type solutions on Bing [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2424.64s)]
*  or elsewhere to scale, and to use that as the modality, you're talking about something that [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2430.56s)]
*  today would cost $80 billion a quarter to run from a compute perspective, if you were to do [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2435.04s)]
*  this across all search queries. So it's certainly going to be a total game changer for a subset of [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2440.08s)]
*  search queries. But to make it economically work for for these businesses, whether it's being or [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2444.3199999999997s)]
*  Google or others, there's a lot of work still to be done. The great part about this Chamath is [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2451.52s)]
*  that Bing gave 10 billion to our friend Sam and chat GPT to invest in Azure, which now has the [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2456.72s)]
*  infrastructure and will be providing the chat GPT infrastructure to startups or corporations, [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2466.0s)]
*  big companies, and small like. So that $10 billion should do enough to grind it down between [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2470.72s)]
*  software optimization, data optimization, chip optimization, and cloud optimization. Yes, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2476.0s)]
*  you would think so or no. The ability to run this at scale is going to happen because [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2480.88s)]
*  we're getting better and better at creating silicon that specializes in doing things in [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2487.52s)]
*  a massively parallelized way. And the cost of energy at the same time is getting cheaper and [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2492.8s)]
*  cheaper along with it. When you multiply these two things together, the effect of it is that [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2499.1200000000003s)]
*  you'll be able to run these models, the same output today will cost one one 10th, as long as [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2503.1200000000003s)]
*  you ride the energy and compute curve for the next few years. So that's just going to naturally [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2508.0s)]
*  happen. I have two interesting takeaways. And one is maybe a little bit of a sidebar. So the sidebar [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2512.4s)]
*  is if you guys were sitting on top of something that you thought was as foundational as Google [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2518.4s)]
*  search back in 1999, would you have sold 49% of it for $10 billion? Hard? No, I think the answer [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2525.92s)]
*  is no. I think the answer is no. Not in an environment where you have unlimited ability [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2532.96s)]
*  to raise capital. This is something that we've said before, which is that chat GPT is an incredibly [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2537.92s)]
*  important innovation. But it's an element of a platform who will get quickly commoditized [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2542.56s)]
*  because everybody will compete over time. And so I think what Microsoft is doing is the natural [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2549.2799999999997s)]
*  thing for somebody on the outside looking in at an entity that has 93% share of a very valuable [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2555.2799999999997s)]
*  category, which is how can I scorch the earth. And so Microsoft effectively for 10 billion, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2561.52s)]
*  bought almost 50% of a tool. And now we'll make that tool as pervasive as possible so that consumer [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2567.44s)]
*  expectations are such that Google is forced to decay the quality of their business model in order [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2574.08s)]
*  to compete. So that as Friedberg said, you have to invest in all kinds of compute resources that [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2580.56s)]
*  today are still somewhat expensive. And that will flow into the PNL. And what you will see is that [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2585.52s)]
*  the business quality degrades. And this is why when Google did the demo of Bard, the first thing [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2591.36s)]
*  that happened was a stock went off 500 basis points, we they locked off $100 billion of the [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2597.92s)]
*  market cap, mostly in reaction to Oh, my God, this is not good for the long term business. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2602.4s)]
*  Explain why it's not good for the long term business on a mechanical basis. When you get [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2607.6800000000003s)]
*  an answer, you don't have to click the links. No, right now, if you look at Google's business, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2611.04s)]
*  they have the best business model ever invented on earth ever for a profit company. It just [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2614.88s)]
*  rains money. This is a business that this year will do almost $100 billion of free cash flow. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2624.88s)]
*  It's a business that has to find ways and we kind of joke but they have to find ways to spend money [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2630.96s)]
*  otherwise they'd be showing probably 50 or 60% EBITDA margins and people would wonder, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2636.4s)]
*  hey, wait a minute, you can't let something like this go unattended. So they try to do a lot more [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2641.68s)]
*  things to make that core treasure look not as incredible as it is. They have 120 billion of [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2646.7999999999997s)]
*  cash. This is a business that's just an absolute juggernaut and they have 10 times as many employees [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2654.08s)]
*  as they need to run the core business that I don't know what that is. But my point is that [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2659.9199999999996s)]
*  it's an incredible business. So that business will get worse if Microsoft takes a few hundred basis [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2664.0s)]
*  points of share, if Metta takes a few hundred basis points of share, if Tencent does, if a few [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2669.76s)]
*  startups do. Quora, by the way, launched something called PoE, which I was experimenting and playing [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2674.96s)]
*  around with last weekend. If you add it all up, what Satya said is true, which is even if all we [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2680.0800000000004s)]
*  do collectively as an industry is take 500 or 600 basis points of share away from Google, it doesn't [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2685.84s)]
*  create that much incremental cost for us, but it does create enormous headwinds and pressure [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2693.76s)]
*  for Google with respect to how they are valued and how they will have to get revalued. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2700.1600000000003s)]
*  And that's what happened. So the last thing I'll say is the question that I've been thinking about [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2704.5600000000004s)]
*  is what does Sundar do? Right? So what's the countermeasure? Yes, this is what I was going to [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2708.5600000000004s)]
*  get to you. I think the countermeasure here, if I was him, is to go to the board and say, guys, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2713.76s)]
*  we're going to double TAC. Right? So TAC is the traffic acquisition cost that Google pays [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2719.44s)]
*  their publishers. It is effectively their way of guaranteeing an exclusivity on search traffic. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2725.44s)]
*  So for example, if you guys have an iPhone, it's Google search. That's the default search [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2732.2400000000002s)]
*  in the iPhone. Google pays Apple. This year, this renegotiation for that deal could mean that Apple [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2736.64s)]
*  gets paid $25 billion for giving away that right to Google. So Google does all these kinds of deals. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2743.28s)]
*  Last year, they spent, I think, $45 billion or so. So about 21%. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2749.04s)]
*  In a way, when you think about that, Shamath, Google basically paid Apple, which was working [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2753.12s)]
*  on search technology. They were working on a search solution. They paid them to stay out of [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2757.2s)]
*  the business. And they're paying everybody. So I think the question for Google is the following. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2761.68s)]
*  If you think you're going to lose share, and let's say you go to 75% share, would you rather go there [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2764.64s)]
*  and actually still maintain your core stranglehold on search? Or do you actually want 75% share where [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2772.0s)]
*  now all of these other competitors have been seeded? Well, you can decay business model quality and [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2780.4s)]
*  still remain exclusive if you just double the TAC. And what you do is you put all these other guys on [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2785.92s)]
*  their heels. Because as we talked about, if you're paying publishers two times more than what anybody [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2791.68s)]
*  else is paying them, you'll be able to get published to say, Hey, you know what, don't let [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2796.96s)]
*  those AI agents crawl your website because I'm paying you all this money. Remember that, right? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2801.52s)]
*  So do not crawl in robots.txt equivalent for these AI agents. And I think that that'll put Microsoft [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2805.76s)]
*  and all these other folks on their heels. And then as you have to figure out all this derivative work [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2812.96s)]
*  stuff, all these lawsuits, Google will look pristine because they can say, I'm paying these [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2818.32s)]
*  guys double because I acknowledge that this is a core part of the service. So that's the game [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2823.36s)]
*  theory, I think that has to get figured out. But if I was Sundar, I'd double the TAC. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2827.36s)]
*  I love the second part. Because hold on, let me get sex about that. I love the second part, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2830.96s)]
*  Chamath, because in this clip, I'm about to show Neelay Patel from The Verge did an awesome [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2834.88s)]
*  interview with Satya. And he basically would not answer this question, at least to my satisfaction, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2840.4s)]
*  which is, Hey, what did the publishers get out of this? You've ingested our information. How [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2848.56s)]
*  do we get paid? Watch this clip. It's very telling. The answer or even in the chat session. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2853.28s)]
*  But if I ask the new Bing, what are the 10 best gaming TVs? And it just makes me a list. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2858.8s)]
*  Why should I the user then click on the link to The Verge, which has another list of the 10 best [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2863.44s)]
*  gaming TVs? Well, that's a great question. But even there, you will sort of say, Hey, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2869.6000000000004s)]
*  where did these things come from? And would you want to go dig in like that? Even search today [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2873.6000000000004s)]
*  has that. Like we have answers. They may not be as high quality answers. They just are getting [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2879.2799999999997s)]
*  better. So I don't think of this as a complete departure from what is expected of a search engine [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2883.8399999999997s)]
*  today, which is supposed to really respond to your query while giving them the links that they can [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2889.2799999999997s)]
*  then click on like ads. And search works that way. In my mind, there's a terrible answer. He needs [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2894.3199999999997s)]
*  to address how they get paid. He punted the answer and just said, Hey, listen, search works this way. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2900.0s)]
*  Sax, will the rights to the data will will Google just stay to Quora? Hey, we'll give you [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2904.16s)]
*  a billion dollars a year for this data set. If you don't give it to anybody else. They should [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2910.3199999999997s)]
*  maybe. Sax, the strategist. Let me hear your strategy here. You're now CEO of Google. What [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2914.24s)]
*  do you do? I think there's maybe even a bigger problem before that, which is, I think the whole [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2918.56s)]
*  monetization model might change. So the reason why Google monetizes so well is, is perceived [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2924.48s)]
*  as having the best search and then it gives you a list of links and a bunch of those links are paid [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2930.48s)]
*  and then people click on them. Now, I think when you search an AI, you're looking for a very [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2936.8s)]
*  different kind of answer. You're not looking for a list of 10 or 20 links. You're just looking for [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2941.92s)]
*  the answer. And so where is the opportunity to advertise against that? I mean, maybe you can [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2946.4s)]
*  charge like an affiliate commission if the answer contains a link in it or something like that. But [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2951.76s)]
*  then you have to ask the question, well, does that distort like best answer? Like am I really [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2958.0s)]
*  getting the best answer or am I getting the answer that someone's willing to pay for? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2963.44s)]
*  This is your key insight. The fact is, if Google gives you an answer, you don't click on ads. Google [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2966.96s)]
*  has had a very finely tuned balance between, hey, these first two or three paid ads, these might, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2972.72s)]
*  the paid links might actually give you a better answer than the content below them. But in this [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2981.12s)]
*  case, if the chat GPT tells you, hey, this is the top three televisions, these are the top three [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2985.28s)]
*  hotels, these are the top three ways to write a better essay, you don't need to click. You have [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2989.76s)]
*  now been given an answer and the model is gone. The paid link is still a subset in that case. So [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=2995.84s)]
*  at Google, we used to have a key metric was the bounce back rate. So when a user clicks on a [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3003.1200000000003s)]
*  result on the search results page, we could see whether or not they came back and searched again. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3011.36s)]
*  And so that tells you the quality of the result that they were given. Because if they don't come [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3018.48s)]
*  back, it means they ended up getting what they were looking for. And so ads that performed better [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3023.04s)]
*  than organic search results, which means someone created the ad paid for it. And the user clicked [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3028.8s)]
*  on it and didn't come back and came back with less frequency than if they clicked on an organic [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3035.52s)]
*  result. That meant that the ad quality was higher than organic quality. And so the ad got promoted [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3040.48s)]
*  to kind of sit at the top and it became a really kind of important part of the equation for Google's [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3045.84s)]
*  business model, which is how do we source how do we monetize more search results, where we can get [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3050.16s)]
*  advertisers to pay for a better result than what organic search might otherwise kind of show. And [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3055.84s)]
*  so it's actually better for the user in this case than say, just getting an answer. For example, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3062.32s)]
*  I'm looking for a PlayStation five, I don't want to just be told, hey, go to Best Buy and buy [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3067.76s)]
*  PlayStation five, I want to be taken to the checkout page to buy a PlayStation five. And I [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3071.6800000000003s)]
*  am more likely to be happy if I click on a result, and it immediately takes me to the checkout page. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3077.2000000000003s)]
*  And Best Buy is really happy to pay for you to get there. Because they don't want you looking [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3081.76s)]
*  around the internet looking for other places. And a lot and we can't convolute all search queries. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3085.1200000000003s)]
*  Not all search queries are, hey, you know, what's the best dog to get to not be on the floor, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3090.4s)]
*  whatever kind of arbitrary question you might have that you're doing research on. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3095.84s)]
*  Many search queries are commerce intention related, I want to buy a flight to go somewhere, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3099.04s)]
*  I want to book a hotel to go somewhere, I want to buy a video game system, etc. That series of [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3104.6400000000003s)]
*  queries may have a very different kind of modality in terms of what's the right interface versus the [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3110.2400000000002s)]
*  chat GPT interface, where yeah, there's a lot of kind of organic results that people sift on the [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3115.52s)]
*  internet for today. And the question earlier can be resolved by Google doing a simple analytical [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3119.6s)]
*  exercise, which is, you know, what's it going to cost us and what's going to give the user the [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3126.72s)]
*  best result. And that's ultimately what will kind of resolve to the better business model. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3130.08s)]
*  It's really measurable. I think on Chamath point, you know, today, Google pays Apple $15 billion a [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3134.0s)]
*  year to be the default search engine on iPhones on the Safari browser. That's only about a quarter [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3139.36s)]
*  of Google's overall tack. The majority of Google's traffic acquisition cost is actually not being [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3147.76s)]
*  paid for search. A good chunk of that is being paid to publishers to do AdSense display ads [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3152.2400000000002s)]
*  on their sites. And Google's rev share back to them for putting ads on their sites. So you know, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3157.44s)]
*  the tack number, I think maybe you kind of want to move the needle, but the majority of Google [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3162.4s)]
*  searches don't come through the default search engine that they pay. It might move the needle [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3166.88s)]
*  a bit, but I don't think it really changes the equation for them. My comment is more tack has [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3172.2400000000002s)]
*  to become a weapon on the forward foot number one. So if you're going to spend 21% of your revenue [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3176.96s)]
*  on tack, you should be willing to spend 30 to 40% to maintain the 93% market share. I don't think [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3183.12s)]
*  what you want to see is your profit dollars decay because you lose share. It's rather better for you [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3189.12s)]
*  to spend the money and decay your business model than have someone decayed for you in general. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3194.48s)]
*  At this point, Apple is really the only tack line item. I understand. I'm not talking about today. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3199.36s)]
*  I'm saying take that idea. You have an entire sales team whose job it is right now to sell [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3205.92s)]
*  AdSense, right? You have an entire group of people who know how to account for tack and how to think [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3211.6s)]
*  about it as a cost. But if you're basically willing to say out of the $100 billion of free cash flow, [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3216.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm willing to go to 80 or 70 billion of free cash flow, combined with the 100 billion of short [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3222.4s)]
*  and long term investments I have, and I'm going to use it as a weapon. And I'm going to go and make [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3229.28s)]
*  sure that all of these publishers have a new kind of agreement that they signed up for, which is [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3234.32s)]
*  I'll do my best to help you monetize. You do your best by being exclusive to our AI agents, right? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3240.0s)]
*  So you deprive other models of your content on your pages because that will get litigated. And [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3246.48s)]
*  there is no way, just like again, if you say do not crawl, you're not allowed to crawl if you're [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3253.1200000000003s)]
*  Google or Microsoft or search it. So this is going to happen for these agents. It's unrealistic to [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3257.6800000000003s)]
*  expect that it won't. So my point is, Google should do this and define how it's done before [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3262.4s)]
*  it's defined for them. Because right now people are in this nascent phase where everybody thinks [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3267.76s)]
*  everybody's going to be open and get along. And I just think that that's unrealistic. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3272.4s)]
*  It's a really important kind of philosophical question. First off, like Google today, just so [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3276.8s)]
*  people know on AdSense is typically paying out 70 cents on every dollar to the publisher. There's, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3281.04s)]
*  you know, it's a pretty, you know, generous and it's the way they've kind of kept the competitive [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3286.08s)]
*  moat, you know, wide and kept folks out of beating them on third party ad network bids, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3290.16s)]
*  because they bid on everything and they always win because they always share the most revenue back. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3296.0s)]
*  So they own that market with respect to acquiring content. You know, the internet is open. It's an [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3299.6s)]
*  open protocol. Anyone can go to any website by typing in the IP address and viewing the content [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3305.44s)]
*  that a publisher chooses to make available on that server to display to the internet. And there's a [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3310.0s)]
*  fair use policy. That's not true. And there's, you can type in any IP address. I think 15 or 20 or 30 [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3314.0s)]
*  of the pages on the internet right now are apps that are closed. Facebook's closed. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3320.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm talking about the open internet, right? So like the content on the open internet. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3323.44s)]
*  I'm saying the open internet matters less and less. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3327.44s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. I mean, look, you're right. Maybe there's the enhancement of the models. But [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3330.4s)]
*  my point being that if the internet is open, and you and I spent a billion lifetimes reading the [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3334.0s)]
*  whole internet and getting smart, and then we were the chatbot, and someone came and asked us a [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3339.44s)]
*  question and we could kind of answer their question, because we've now read the whole internet. Do I owe [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3343.6800000000003s)]
*  licensing royalty revenues to the knowledge that I gained? And then the synthesis that I did, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3349.7599999999998s)]
*  which ultimately meant excluding some things, including some things, combining certain things. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3354.64s)]
*  And the problem with these LLMs, these large language models, is that you end up with 100 [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3359.2799999999997s)]
*  million, a billion plus parameters that are in these models that are really impossible to [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3364.8799999999997s)]
*  deconvolute. You don't know, we don't really understand deeply how the neural network is, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3370.0s)]
*  the model is defined and run based on the data that it is constantly kind of aggregating and [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3375.84s)]
*  learning from. And so to go in and say, Hey, it learned a little more from this website, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3381.04s)]
*  and a little less from that website. I'm not saying that. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3384.88s)]
*  It's a practical impossibility. I'm saying when you look at transformer [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3386.6400000000003s)]
*  architecture today, every LLM that you write on the same corpus of underlying data for training [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3390.0s)]
*  will get to the same answer. So my point is today, if you're a company, the most important [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3396.08s)]
*  thing that you can do, especially you have a $1 trillion plus market cap that could get [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3402.72s)]
*  competed away, is to figure out how to defend it. And so all I'm saying is from the perspective of [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3407.8399999999997s)]
*  a shareholder of Google, and also from the perspective of the board of director or senior [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3412.9599999999996s)]
*  executive or the CEO, this should be the number one thing that I'm thinking about. And my, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3417.52s)]
*  my framing of how to answer that question is build a competitive moat around two things. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3423.4399999999996s)]
*  One is at the end, which is how much money and what kind of relationship do I have with my [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3429.68s)]
*  customers, including the publishers? And can I give them more? So that number two is, I can affect [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3438.0s)]
*  who they decide to contribute their content to. So you're right, let's assume that there are [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3446.4s)]
*  five of these infinite libraries in the world. You mean non public content? [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3451.6s)]
*  How important and also public how important is it if Quora says, you know what, guys, I've done a [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3455.84s)]
*  deal where my billions of paid views and all of that really rich content core has incredible [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3461.6000000000004s)]
*  content. Google's paying me two billion a year. And so I've decided to only let Google's AI agents [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3466.6400000000003s)]
*  crawl it. And so maybe when there are questions that Quora is already doing an phenomenal job [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3472.1600000000003s)]
*  of answering, I think it does make a difference that Google now has access to Quora's content, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3479.04s)]
*  and others don't. Right for a hot minute, they did have access to the Twitter firehose. And that [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3484.72s)]
*  was the premise was we could get this corpus of data that we can have in a very limited restricted [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3489.12s)]
*  way. They paid Twitter a lot of money. I don't think that those deals exist anymore. Twitter, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3494.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, you guys might know better than I do, but I don't think they exist anymore. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3498.64s)]
*  Here's where I think you're right. And maybe, David, I think you're being too forgiven. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3501.4399999999996s)]
*  These models know where they got the data. And they can easily cite the sources, and they can [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3507.68s)]
*  easily pay for it. And if you want to see the sample of this, hold good. You're absolutely right, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3513.84s)]
*  the video in the Wall Street Journal, where Satya was interviewed showed a demo. And you're exactly [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3518.96s)]
*  right. They actually showed Jason in the search results. Yes, the five resources, but it made no [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3524.4s)]
*  sense because it's like, how do you know that those are the five most cited places that resulted in [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3529.36s)]
*  this? Page rank technology, or the authority of the website or the author. But let's pause for a [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3534.08s)]
*  second here. There is a company called Neva.com. I'm not an investor, none of us are. It's a former [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3539.52s)]
*  Googler. They have 78 employees, I think, according to LinkedIn, I just typed in one of the best flat [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3544.96s)]
*  panel TVs. Here's the result. And as you see, sentence by sentence, as it rewrites another [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3550.08s)]
*  person's content, it links with a citation, just like the Wikipedia does. And when you scroll to [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3556.8s)]
*  the bottom of it, it tells you, hey, this is from Rolling Stone, this is from Best Buy, this is from [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3562.32s)]
*  ratings. And if that answer is good for you, and you trust those sources, those people should get [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3565.44s)]
*  a commission. Every time there's 1000 searches, and you come up, you should get $1 every time [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3570.0s)]
*  your data was used. And if not, these sites should sue the daylights out of Google. And for Google to [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3575.12s)]
*  say they can't do it is hogwash. Why isn't it fair use? It's not fair use because in fair use, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3580.96s)]
*  you have the ability to create derivative works on future platforms. And you are taking this person, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3588.64s)]
*  the original content owners ability to exploit that, and you are co opting it and you're doing [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3594.8s)]
*  it at scale. And that is against fair use. You're not allowed to interfere with my ability to make [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3599.44s)]
*  future products, David, you know, this is an attorney, the problem with that, I'm not an IP [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3603.36s)]
*  lawyer, sorry. All right, well, I play one on TV. And this podcast, the problem with that idea, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3607.84s)]
*  just from a product perspective for a second is that if you limit how they can tokenize to just [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3612.32s)]
*  being all entire sentences, the product will not be that good. Like the whole idea of these LLMs [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3619.6s)]
*  is that you're running, you know, so many iterations to literally figure out what is the next most best [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3625.44s)]
*  word that comes after this other word. And if you're all of a sudden stuck with blocks of [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3630.56s)]
*  sentences as inputs that can't be violated because of copyright, the product will not be as good. I [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3635.44s)]
*  don't just don't think it'll be as useful. Correct. These are also not deterministic models. And [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3640.3199999999997s)]
*  they're not deterministic outputs, meaning that it's not a discrete and specific answer that's [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3644.72s)]
*  going to be repeated every time the model is run. These are statistical models. So they infer [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3649.8399999999997s)]
*  what the right answer could or should be based on a corpus of data and a synthesis of that data [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3655.3599999999997s)]
*  to generate a response to a query. That reference, that inference is going to be, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3659.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, assign some probability score. And so the model will resolve to something that it thinks [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3665.04s)]
*  is high probability, but it could also kind of say, Hey, there's a chance that this is the [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3669.68s)]
*  better answer. This is the better answer and so on. And so when you have like you have in the [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3672.72s)]
*  internet competing data, competing points of view, competing opinions, the model is synthesizing all [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3676.64s)]
*  these different opinions and doing what Google search engine historically has done well, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3682.8799999999997s)]
*  which is trying to rank them and figure out which ones are better than others. And that's a very [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3686.64s)]
*  dynamic process. And so if as part of that ingest process, one is using some open, openly readable [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3690.3999999999996s)]
*  data set, that doesn't necessarily mean that that data set is improving the quality of the output [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3697.04s)]
*  or is necessarily the answer from the output. Correct. Let me just give everybody a quick [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3702.48s)]
*  four factor education on fair use. And here it is from Google's actual website, because they deal [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3708.0s)]
*  with this all the time. And when you look at it, the nature and purpose and character of the work, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3713.84s)]
*  including whether such use is not profit or educational purposes. So that first test [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3718.8s)]
*  of fair use is, Hey, if you're using it educationally, and you want to make a video [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3724.4s)]
*  that is criticism of Star Wars prequels, or how to shoot a shot like this Quentin Tarantino, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3728.48s)]
*  if it's educational, it's fine. And courts typically focus I'm reading here from Google [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3735.76s)]
*  on whether the use is transformative. That is whether it adds new expression or meaning to the [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3739.44s)]
*  original, whether it merely copies the original. It's very obvious that this is not transformative. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3743.76s)]
*  They're just rewriting it. The nature of the copyright seems pretty transformative to me. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3748.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3752.4s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. They're coming out with entirely new content. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3753.12s)]
*  They're just rewriting it. They're not actually adding anything to it. Transform would be fine. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3756.32s)]
*  If a human does it, it's not. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3761.76s)]
*  If you transform it, it's pretty cool. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3765.04s)]
*  Listen, I think the rights issue is just like the cost issue, which is a problem today, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3767.36s)]
*  maybe, but it's going to get sorted out. But here, let me finish new technology [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3774.6400000000003s)]
*  waves that are this powerful. Don't get stymied by either chip costs or legal rights issues. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3778.2400000000002s)]
*  They do, by the way. You're 100% wrong. YouTube got stopped dead in their tracks. And the only [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3784.72s)]
*  way YouTube and Napster got stopped in the tracks, I predict this is going to get stopped dead in its [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3789.7599999999998s)]
*  tracks with YouTube level near-death experience lawsuits. And Google was enabled to piracy. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3793.68s)]
*  And then they had to build tools to fight against it. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3801.2s)]
*  I deeply disagree with you. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3803.9199999999996s)]
*  I disagree with both of you guys. You guys both think that cost is going to stay in the way. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3804.8799999999997s)]
*  Hold on. Let me read you number four. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3809.04s)]
*  Nothing's going to stay in the way of the AI. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3809.12s)]
*  No, it's going to stay in the way. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3811.68s)]
*  The AI wants to happen. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3812.9599999999996s)]
*  Big companies using AI to... [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3814.16s)]
*  The AI is already happening. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3816.3999999999996s)]
*  AI is happening. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3818.64s)]
*  Let's move the conversation forward. I actually want to tell you my AI experience. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3819.6s)]
*  I would like to make my point. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3823.2s)]
*  We don't need your amateur lawyer opinions. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3824.48s)]
*  I am going to give my point. I don't give a shit if you want it or not. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3826.48s)]
*  The effect of abuse upon... [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3829.6s)]
*  Are you going to bill us 500 bucks an hour for pretending to be a lawyer on TV? [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3830.16s)]
*  The effect of abuse. Let's look at this. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3833.8399999999997s)]
*  I've heard this point of view before from you. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3836.3999999999996s)]
*  Here it is. Okay. Take it easy, Mr. Sub. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3839.12s)]
*  Better call J. Cal. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3841.68s)]
*  This is the third time you've done this. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3843.04s)]
*  The effect... Listen to this. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3845.04s)]
*  The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyright work. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3846.56s)]
*  Uses that harm the copyright... Listen to this. Very important. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3851.68s)]
*  Uses that harm... [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3854.7999999999997s)]
*  When the AI takes over the world like Skynet, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3855.2s)]
*  J. Cal's going to be like, I thought we'd stop this with rights. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3857.7599999999998s)]
*  Listen to this. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3861.12s)]
*  AI is not going to be stopped, but companies using AI to steal content will be. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3862.32s)]
*  With rights. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3865.84s)]
*  The effect of use... [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3866.24s)]
*  Uses that harm the original copyright owner's ability to profit from his or [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3868.08s)]
*  her original work by serving as a replacement for demands for that work are less likely to be fair uses. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3872.0s)]
*  Seeson's Assist AI. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3878.24s)]
*  This is the one. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3878.96s)]
*  Okay, great. Okay. You made your point. You made your point and you may be right. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3880.32s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Sorry. Do we need to get to Marjorie Taylor Greene for you to have a good show? [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3884.08s)]
*  No. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3888.0s)]
*  Sure. Let's queue up Marjorie Taylor Greene. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3888.56s)]
*  No, no. Hold on. Hold on. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3890.56s)]
*  How much did you raise for her? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3891.68s)]
*  I have another aspect of the AI thing I want to talk about besides this like [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3893.04s)]
*  intermural rights issue that you're going on and on about. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3897.76s)]
*  Better call J. Cole. Go. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3900.4799999999996s)]
*  So I had an interesting AI experience this week and I think we're all going to start having these stories. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3902.72s)]
*  Oh, you use the AI to make a script of how to talk to your kids. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3908.24s)]
*  No. Every week there'll be some new use case that you see that you're kind of blown away by. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3910.56s)]
*  The use case I saw this past week in a product demo was they were showing me like an Excel spreadsheet, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3915.52s)]
*  like a very complicated Excel spreadsheet modeling and financial asset. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3922.3199999999997s)]
*  And they had a plug-in to a chat GPT type AI. And so they just asked it. They typed in, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3926.72s)]
*  what does this spreadsheet do? And it spit out like a one paragraph explanation of what the [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3934.96s)]
*  spreadsheet did. And it was really good. I mean, because me just eyeballing the spreadsheet, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3939.6s)]
*  I could not have figured out like instantly what that thing did. It would have taken me like a while [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3944.24s)]
*  to figure it out. It told me here are the key inputs, here are the key outputs. So that was [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3949.12s)]
*  number one. Then they did something I think even more interesting, which is they said, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3952.88s)]
*  give me the formula that tells me when the yield is above 2% and this and that and that. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3958.96s)]
*  And the chat GPT spat out a formula that was like perfect Excel logic. That was something that you [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3966.88s)]
*  or I could never figure out. You need like a super pro user of Excel to basically know how to do the [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3973.52s)]
*  stuff. So it spit it out and like, boom, it worked instantly. They copy and paste into the spreadsheet [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3979.44s)]
*  and you could basically like the spreadsheet was much more advanced now. So what it got me thinking [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3984.8s)]
*  about is that we're going to have these little assistants everywhere. You combine that power [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3990.16s)]
*  with say speech to text, right? Because we could have just talked to it. The speech to text would [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=3996.16s)]
*  transcribe the instruction, spit it back out and you're going to have these like little personal [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4002.32s)]
*  digital assistants in applications. I think it's pretty obvious to see how AI could replace call [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4006.88s)]
*  centers with having the frontline call center operator be, instead of being a human, it could [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4014.2400000000002s)]
*  be like an AI. But this is actually even before that. I think in every single application that [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4019.76s)]
*  we use, there's going to be an AI interface and it is probably going to be voice-based where you can [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4025.6s)]
*  just say to it, Hey, I'm trying to accomplish this. Like, how do I do it? Can you just make it happen? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4031.28s)]
*  Totally. And it's going to be really powerful. I have an idea. I was hanging out with Andre [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4037.1200000000003s)]
*  Carpathy and I gave him this following challenge. So there I was. So there I was. I said, if you had [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4041.36s)]
*  to build Stripe, I said, how many engineers do you think it would take you and how long would it take [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4048.2400000000002s)]
*  you to build a competitor? I was just, it's just a thought exercise. You know, it would take hundreds [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4054.0800000000004s)]
*  of millions of dollars and years. Now imagine you could, you were feeling threatened by Stripe. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4057.44s)]
*  Imagine you're a large company. Visa MasterCard just as an example. You can now actually get one [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4065.44s)]
*  or two really smart people like him to lead an effort where you would say, here's a couple [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4073.44s)]
*  hundred million dollars to compete with Stripe, but here are the boundary conditions. Number one [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4080.08s)]
*  is you can only hire five or 10 engineers. And so what you would do is you would actually use [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4084.16s)]
*  tools like this to write the code for you. And the ability to write code is going to be the first [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4090.3199999999997s)]
*  thing that these guys, that these things do incredibly well with absolute precision. You [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4095.3599999999997s)]
*  can already do unit testing incredibly well, but it's going to go from unit testing to basically [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4099.76s)]
*  end to end testing. And you'll be able to build a version of Stripe extremely quickly and in a very [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4104.24s)]
*  lean way. So then the question is, well, what would you do with the two or 300 million you raise? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4111.12s)]
*  And my thought is you use it again as tack. You go to customers, you go to customers and you're [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4115.92s)]
*  like, well, listen, if Braintree is going to charge you one basis point over Visa MasterCard and, or [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4122.32s)]
*  sorry, a hundred basis points and Stripe will 50, you know what? I'll charge 10. Margin destruction, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4128.64s)]
*  margin destruction. And this is going to make everything so interesting. You can take any [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4134.64s)]
*  business that's a middleman business. I think this is the point. Any middleman business right [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4139.28s)]
*  now that doesn't have its own competitive mode can be competed against because now you can take [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4144.16s)]
*  all of those input costs that go into human capital. You can defer that, have a much smaller human [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4149.5199999999995s)]
*  capital pool and push all of that extra money into traffic acquisition and substitution. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4155.12s)]
*  This goes to the Silicon Valley of being more efficient. This is going to lead to that efficiency. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4158.88s)]
*  The net benefit of all of this is economic productivity because the end customer that's [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4163.12s)]
*  using that tool that you just mentioned, they now have a lower cost to run their business [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4167.52s)]
*  and their total net profits go up. And this is what happens with every technology cycle. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4171.52s)]
*  It always yields greater economic productivity and that's why the economy grows. And that's why [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4176.320000000001s)]
*  I just want to say this is so important. That's why technology is so important to drive economic [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4180.72s)]
*  growth, not debt. We've historically used financial engineering to drive economic growth. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4185.360000000001s)]
*  And this is why we need immigration. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4189.84s)]
*  Technology and innovation drive this. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4191.360000000001s)]
*  What about China? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4193.200000000001s)]
*  What about China? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4193.92s)]
*  Wait, what are you talking about? What we're describing here is AI making it harder and [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4195.12s)]
*  harder to make humans productive. So you want to bring in millions of- [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4200.88s)]
*  No, it's more productivity per human talent. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4205.76s)]
*  Per human of labor. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4207.76s)]
*  It's going to make super humans. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4208.72s)]
*  One human can do the coding that 20 humans would do before. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4210.64s)]
*  Assuming they're skilled enough to use the AI. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4213.84s)]
*  Guys, go back to traditional capitalism. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4215.52s)]
*  Check. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4217.76s)]
*  Programming? [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4218.32s)]
*  Go back to traditional capitalism for a second. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4220.0s)]
*  Please. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4221.84s)]
*  The Stripe example is another good one. So if you have this business model, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4222.96s)]
*  how does the ecosystem get efficient? How do we create more opportunity to use [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4227.12s)]
*  Friedberg's language? Well, the only way that it really happens, how does cost go down, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4232.719999999999s)]
*  is that certain entities become big enough that they can drive the prices down. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4237.28s)]
*  An Uber, a DoorDash or whomever says, yes, I need payments capability. So [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4241.679999999999s)]
*  Braintree, give me your best bid. Checkout.com, give me your best bid. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4246.5599999999995s)]
*  Adyen, give me your best bid. Stripe, give me your best bid. You compete it down. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4249.84s)]
*  Amazon comes in. Walmart comes in. They do it in physical CPG goods. They do it online. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4253.28s)]
*  They do it for all kinds of technologies. But you've never had an internal form that [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4258.72s)]
*  can create hyper efficiency and basically create customer value like this thing can. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4263.52s)]
*  Because this thing can allow a billion- [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4269.4400000000005s)]
*  Let me show you an example. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4271.28s)]
*  ...jillion 10 person companies to get created that can do the work of 10,000 people. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4272.56s)]
*  That's what's so cool. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4276.64s)]
*  Hold on. Let me show you two things. These are two aha moments I had this week. This first one is [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4277.68s)]
*  called Galileo AI. It was just a tweet. You describe the design of an app. Here they say, [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4280.4800000000005s)]
*  an onboarding screen of a dog walking app. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4286.16s)]
*  Incredible. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4288.64s)]
*  And you type that in and it gives you a welcome screen. That's like a seven out of 10. Then it [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4289.12s)]
*  says, oh, a way for people to change their name, phone number, password. You know, that classic [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4294.4800000000005s)]
*  screen on any app. I need to change my thing. Boom, it gives you that. Well, then at the same [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4297.84s)]
*  time that people are making text to UX user interface, beautiful here. This stuff will get [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4302.0s)]
*  dumped into Figma. But then there's a GitHub co-pilot, which if you haven't seen, we all know [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4308.56s)]
*  it here. This is allowing you GitHub and GitHub co-pilot. GitHub is bought by Microsoft, another [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4315.76s)]
*  one of Satya Nadella's incredible acquisitions. This guy's like the new Zuckerberg. I mean, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4321.52s)]
*  what an incredible person to come after a bomber who's just so effective at what he's doing. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4327.120000000001s)]
*  As you're writing your code, it fills in your code. It knows what you're writing, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4333.92s)]
*  just like in an email. And it's a smaller subset of information than email. Email, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4337.6s)]
*  you could write anything. You could be, you know, talking to a lover or a business person, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4341.76s)]
*  whatever. Here, when you're doing programming, it's a much finer data set. These two things [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4345.92s)]
*  are going to come together where you're going to be able to build your MVP for your startup [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4350.96s)]
*  by typing in text and then publish it. You're not going to need a developer for your startup. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4354.88s)]
*  That is transformative in the world. Let me ask you guys a question. Do you think that this [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4359.6s)]
*  leverage, and I argue this is all about like leverage. It's one person can generate X [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4364.64s)]
*  units of output more. Yep. Do you guys think that this commoditizes and puts at risk, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4369.28s)]
*  Sachs in particular, like all of enterprise SaaS, because it becomes such a commodity to basically [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4375.28s)]
*  build a business that does something now? Or does it create much higher returns for investors? [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4380.72s)]
*  Because you invest so much less capital to get to a point of productivity with that business, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4385.360000000001s)]
*  a revenue of that business than was needed before. I'm not sure. I tend to think that if it gets [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4390.56s)]
*  easier, then everything becomes more competitive. So, I don't know. But the value gets competed. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4396.72s)]
*  By the way, I would slightly disagree with the characterization. Does this scare you as an investor? [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4403.68s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, for example, in that demo we just saw, what does the AI do? It exports the new [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4408.48s)]
*  design assets to Figma format. Yeah, it just makes you faster. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4415.04s)]
*  So, if you can create a SaaS product that becomes a standard, everyone's still going to want to use [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4418.96s)]
*  it. There's really good reasons for that. So, I don't know. I don't think business software [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4423.84s)]
*  is going away. I also don't think that you're not going to need to hire engineers because Co-pilot [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4429.04s)]
*  is going to do it for you. I think what Co-pilot will do is make your typical engineer more [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4433.44s)]
*  productive. They had some graphs around how Co-pilot reduced coding time by 50%. So, I think [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4437.68s)]
*  you'll be able to get a lot more out of your developers. I think that's sort of the key is [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4446.16s)]
*  a lot of the drudgery work gets taken care of. The answer, Freeberg, to your question is, I think [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4450.320000000001s)]
*  more startups, more niche startups will make better products and then you'll just have many more folks [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4455.4400000000005s)]
*  like making SaaS for dentists. Are those venture-backable? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4461.92s)]
*  They don't get big enough, right? I mean, in that case, entry price matters. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4466.0s)]
*  It'll be poorer returns. Well, entry price matters too. If you're investing at 5 million, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4470.0s)]
*  like I do in companies when they're just on napkins and back of envelope, there's plenty of [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4473.92s)]
*  room. If you have a $200 million exit, that's a 40X. But there could be a lot of new categories, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4478.96s)]
*  too. Like a lot of new categories. There could be a lot of traditional industries. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4483.28s)]
*  There's a lot of traditional industries that get disrupted. We're thinking about just software [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4488.24s)]
*  displacing software. It could be software displacing industries that aren't even software. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4491.76s)]
*  Video games. I think the entire video game industry is going to get completely rewritten [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4497.04s)]
*  with AI because you're not going to have a publisher anymore that makes one game that [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4500.0s)]
*  everyone consumes. You're going to have tools that everyone creates and consumes their own game. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4502.88s)]
*  You guys want to watch this cool clip? It's 58 seconds long. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4508.0s)]
*  Go ahead. This is a music- [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4510.72s)]
*  Clip day here on All In. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4512.88s)]
*  But I thought it was really cool. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4514.4800000000005s)]
*  Is this AI turning you into M&M? This is what the world's waiting for. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4515.92s)]
*  I hope it's you doing an M&M song. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4520.16s)]
*  It's not me. I'm naturally M&M-like, but this is a- [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4521.36s)]
*  Only in your anger. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4524.24s)]
*  This is the future rave sound. I'm getting lost in an underground. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4525.36s)]
*  This is the future rave sound. I'm getting lost in an underground. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4529.28s)]
*  Is that M&M? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4533.2s)]
*  It's David Guetta playing M&M, a track with M&M's voice, right? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4535.84s)]
*  M&M was something that I made as a joke and it worked so good. I could not believe it. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4540.24s)]
*  I discovered those websites that are about AI. Basically, you can write lyrics in the style of [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4547.52s)]
*  any artist you like. So I typed, write a verse in the style of M&M about future rave. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4556.8s)]
*  And I went to another AI website that can recreate the voice. I put the text in that. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4564.320000000001s)]
*  And I played the record and people went nuts. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4572.88s)]
*  That is nuts. It's nuts. And the crowd went wild for it. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4576.24s)]
*  So here it is, folks. Whoever makes the best Friedberg M&M hybrid rap with David [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4580.16s)]
*  Sachs as the hype man is getting a free VIP ticket to All in Summit 2023. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4585.679999999999s)]
*  I think we need an original- [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4590.4s)]
*  I think we need an original performance at All in Summit 2023. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4591.44s)]
*  1000%. You and I are so in sync these days, Friedberg. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4593.759999999999s)]
*  There are going to be a lot of interesting mashups that get created. For example, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4597.679999999999s)]
*  you'd be able to create a movie where, let's say you want to make a western and you want John [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4601.84s)]
*  Wayne to star in it. I mean, you obviously get the rights from the Wayne estate, but no actor [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4605.84s)]
*  ever goes away. There's going to be a database of all of them. But if you want to make it- [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4610.639999999999s)]
*  Sachs, it's going to be better. You're going to be writing the script. As you write the script, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4614.32s)]
*  the AI is going to be showing you that scene in real time. And when you delete- [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4617.679999999999s)]
*  And you don't have to publish it. Right? That's the point. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4621.28s)]
*  Cloudy day, rainy day, it'll just change in real time. Think about what that would do for Star Wars. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4622.5599999999995s)]
*  Just like Instagram and TikTok basically democratized everyone's ability to create [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4627.6s)]
*  and publish content, this takes it to a whole other level where the monopoly that big [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4634.88s)]
*  production houses have, because they have the big budget so they can afford to make a big movie, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4640.64s)]
*  if that cost of making a $10 million movie goes to $10,000 or $1,000 of compute time, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4644.56s)]
*  anyone sitting in their studio in a basement can start to make a movie. And it really changes the [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4649.280000000001s)]
*  landscape for all media, not just movies, music, video games. And ultimately the consumers themselves [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4654.56s)]
*  can create stuff for their own enjoyment and maybe the best of those products win. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4661.92s)]
*  You nailed it. But having each individual create their own content- [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4665.6s)]
*  Freebird, here's what's going to happen. Freebird- [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4667.68s)]
*  Maybe industry will just become a lot more like the music industry. I mean, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4668.56s)]
*  remember anyone can really create a song now. And they do. And people do go viral on TikTok. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4671.280000000001s)]
*  And they upload it on DistroKit and it's on Spotify. Did you guys see this article in [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4675.68s)]
*  the New York Times that was kind of throwing some shade at the CEO of Goldman Sachs, David Solomon? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4680.32s)]
*  Yes. I just didn't see the headline. You look great in the picture, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4685.84s)]
*  but I didn't read it because I figured it's hate. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4689.04s)]
*  They were talking about his side gig as being a DJ, but specifically they called out [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4690.799999999999s)]
*  a potential conflict of interest. And it's related to this because I guess he had gotten a license to [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4697.12s)]
*  a Whitney Houston song and he remixed it and released it on Spotify. And her biopic is about [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4702.799999999999s)]
*  to come out. And they thought that there could be this perceived conflict because Goldman works [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4710.24s)]
*  on behalf of the publishing company. And my thought was along the lines of what you guys said, like, [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4715.44s)]
*  why is this a story? Meaning David Solomon should be able to go to any website, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4720.0s)]
*  license the song, make it, and then submit it back to them for them to approve. Because the quote in [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4724.88s)]
*  here that matters is the company that licensed it said, we are in the business of making sure [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4729.679999999999s)]
*  this body of music stays relevant. So obviously you want Whitney Houston songs, Michael Jackson [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4735.28s)]
*  songs, you want John Wayne, you want these people to live on in culture because it's part of our [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4740.96s)]
*  culture. Look at this subhead. David Solomon brushes off DJing. The better way to maximize it [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4745.92s)]
*  will be like this, go and use it, create a derivative work, let us see it if we like it. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4751.679999999999s)]
*  So like Guetta should be able to just give that back to Eminem. If Eminem's cool with it, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4756.08s)]
*  he should be able to ship it and just be done. What a non-story. Like the New York Times is just [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4760.24s)]
*  so anti-billionaire. David Solomon brushes off DJing as a minor hobby that has little to do with [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4764.0s)]
*  his work at the bank, but his activities may pose potential conflicts of interest. It's like, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4770.32s)]
*  what are they writing about? Is there not something more important than this? [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4775.84s)]
*  Do we think that David Solomon or any CEO of any major bank on Wall Street would put their job at [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4779.12s)]
*  risk running one of the 20 or 30 most important institutions in the financial architecture of the [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4784.64s)]
*  world to license a Whitney Houston song that they can play at Coachella? I mean, does that pass [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4789.68s)]
*  the smell test? No, no. And just for the record, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4795.52s)]
*  iconoclastic David Solomon, you're going to be doing the opening night DJ set for All in [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4800.16s)]
*  Summit 2023. The grift is on. Let's get him. He's booked. If the New York Times hates him, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4804.88s)]
*  anybody the New York Times hates on, you got a slot. You got a slot. That'll be our lens here. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4811.12s)]
*  Dave Chappelle. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4816.400000000001s)]
*  Dave Chappelle for sure. 1000%. I mean, he looks good. It looks like he's living his best life. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4817.76s)]
*  It's a finance nerd. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4822.16s)]
*  Does this just offend them somehow? It just like offends them that a corporate CEO could be a DJ? [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4823.280000000001s)]
*  Well, that anybody's happy. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4828.16s)]
*  I think it's kind of cool this guy DJs. Yeah. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4832.8s)]
*  Fuck yeah. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4835.68s)]
*  Let him do his thing. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4836.16s)]
*  I've always wanted to be a DJ. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4837.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4838.72s)]
*  Oh, DJ Polly Hoppetea. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4839.04s)]
*  Spin the one and twos. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4841.360000000001s)]
*  You could be DJ one night at the All in 2020 after party and we'll use AI to help [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4842.24s)]
*  you out. When I should have been learning how to DJ, I was playing the violin. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4847.52s)]
*  You should get up there and Urkel your violin under a DJ set. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4853.360000000001s)]
*  That would be next level. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4855.92s)]
*  I played violin for 10 years. We can play a duet together. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4856.56s)]
*  I played it for 14 years. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4859.120000000001s)]
*  I played in an orchestra. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4860.320000000001s)]
*  Oh my God. I never knew this. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4862.96s)]
*  Never again. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4864.320000000001s)]
*  This is all kind of revelations happening here. By the way, here is my most, pull up that first chat [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4865.280000000001s)]
*  GPT I gave you. This was an aha moment. Me and Sax were doing our weekly mastermind group. Sax [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4870.4800000000005s)]
*  and I get together. We kind of like co-mentor each other. Here was something that blew us away [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4877.2s)]
*  during our mastermind group. This was a chat GPT. I did this one because I was trying to figure this [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4882.08s)]
*  out. How do I make my spouse and kids feel heard? And in chat GPT gave us a great one. Give them [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4886.32s)]
*  your full attention. Number two, empathize. Number three, validate their feelings. There you have it, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4890.8s)]
*  Sax. Just put that into your stuff. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4894.88s)]
*  Hey, J.L., let me use this as an example. So that's obviously the aggregation and synthesis [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4896.5599999999995s)]
*  of lots of different self-help websites. How do you describe attribution of that answer to [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4901.84s)]
*  a particular content publisher? Honestly, serious question. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4906.64s)]
*  Fair use, derivative work. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4909.52s)]
*  I think in this case, there would be no monetization opportunity there. There's no monetization. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4912.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, you say that because you hate content providers. But here, I tell you, this is [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4918.56s)]
*  compassionate publishing. I think the chat GPT should be given a pass. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4921.200000000001s)]
*  You have weird blinders on on this one, J.L. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4924.56s)]
*  Because this is, no, they know who they got it from. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4926.160000000001s)]
*  They know who they got it from. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4929.360000000001s)]
*  It's a synthesis of lots of websites. It's a very smart synthesis. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4929.6s)]
*  You can build the software. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4932.72s)]
*  It's not pulling a result from someone's website. It's like read hundreds of websites and it's [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4934.72s)]
*  like average them. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4938.72s)]
*  Bulldog. How do you pay for the average? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4939.68s)]
*  That's complete bullshit. They could say, as we ingest this stuff, tag it. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4941.76s)]
*  That is how it's being done. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4945.6s)]
*  And then you could publish it. When you publish it, you say, hey, where do we start this from? [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4947.52s)]
*  You're doing with J.L. Is that what you're saying? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4950.72s)]
*  No, I'm saying it's not bullshit. That is what you said is exactly how it's being done. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4952.240000000001s)]
*  Right. And J.L., if let's say that the AI is using 100 different websites and synthesizing [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4955.280000000001s)]
*  100 websites, what's the incentive for the marginal 100th website to say, well, opt me out [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4961.68s)]
*  unless you pay me. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4966.8s)]
*  Totally. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4967.6s)]
*  Right. So that's the shakedown. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4968.16s)]
*  Google or OpenAI will just be like, okay, fine. We'll just work with the other 99. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4969.6s)]
*  And this is why content providers is my best piece of advice. You ask the question, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4974.08s)]
*  I'll give you the answer. Content providers as a group need to get together and fight for their [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4977.12s)]
*  rights in unison. New York Times, Medicare. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4981.52s)]
*  Fight for their right to party? [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4984.0s)]
*  No, fight for their right to get paid and to survive. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4985.52s)]
*  I'll tell you what I think is going to happen. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4987.92s)]
*  So to chat to BT and say, as a group, either give us these terms or don't index us. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4989.04s)]
*  You're trying to unionize all the content creators. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4993.76s)]
*  Absolutely unionize all of them. They should be a united front like the music industry. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=4996.24s)]
*  Why do you think the music industry gets paid by Peloton and anybody else? [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5000.16s)]
*  Because it was easy for the five of them get together and they fight. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5003.68s)]
*  There's five of them and you could organize, but there's millions and millions of publishers. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5005.68s)]
*  I think the point here is that technology is fundamentally deflationary. Here's the next [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5009.6s)]
*  great example where the minute you make something incredible, costs go down, [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5014.72s)]
*  but also frankly, revenue and profit dollars go down in the aggregate. Doesn't mean that one [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5019.68s)]
*  company can't husband a lot of it and do incredibly well like Google has done, but it's just going to [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5023.84s)]
*  fundamentally put pressure on all these business models. I think it's important for Google to take [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5029.04s)]
*  it. Google should go and they should cannibalize their own business before it is cannibalized for [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5034.4800000000005s)]
*  them. Freebird, final word. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5040.64s)]
*  Here's another way to think about it. I think that if this goes as we all predict and everyone [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5042.16s)]
*  saying it's going to go, it is more likely than not that many of these quote content publishers [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5046.639999999999s)]
*  that aren't adding very much marginal value are going to go away. That you could see the [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5051.36s)]
*  number of content sites offering self-help advice and how to do this and how to do that. 95% of them [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5055.12s)]
*  go away because all of that work gets aggregated and synthesized and presented in a really simple, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5060.639999999999s)]
*  easy user interface that makes them completely oblivious. I'm not discrediting the value that [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5065.68s)]
*  many content publishers provide, but the requisite at that point to be valued as a [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5070.4s)]
*  quote novel content producer is going to go way up. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5077.36s)]
*  The offset to that though is it's so much easier to create content because of the AI. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5080.879999999999s)]
*  We have this company Copy AI where even before this chat GPT stuff, you would just go there and [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5085.92s)]
*  say, I want to write a blog about X, Y, and Z. You just give it a title and it spits out a post and [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5090.879999999999s)]
*  then they'll actually give you 10 different blog posts and then you just select the one that [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5096.96s)]
*  is the direction you want to go and you keep doing human selection on it. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5101.84s)]
*  But how does new intelligence get put back into the system? That's based on an existing [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5105.52s)]
*  corporate system. No, you have a corporate blog so you publish it to your corporate blog. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5110.24s)]
*  My point is if there is now some new information in the world, who is going to add that to the [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5113.68s)]
*  corpus if everybody is just stealing content and rewriting it? It is stealing. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5118.72s)]
*  Humans have always had a desire to create. Most people create for free. There's a head of the [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5124.32s)]
*  long tail that actually gets compensated. The rest of the long tails traditionally got nothing [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5128.24s)]
*  and they do it because they want to create. And now the creation is going to explode because it's [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5132.719999999999s)]
*  so easy. Beethoven listened to Haydn and then Beethoven wrote novel symphonies and his symphonies [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5137.44s)]
*  were incredible and he built on the experience of listening to Haydn. The same is true of how [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5142.4s)]
*  content is going to evolve and it's going to evolve in a faster way because of AI. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5146.8s)]
*  And this content is not just being retrieved and reproduced. It's being synthesized and aggregated [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5151.04s)]
*  and re-presented in a novel way. By the way, I'd like to say one- [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5156.799999999999s)]
*  Hold on. I want to answer that. I want to answer that, please. If Chat GPT takes a Yelp review [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5159.28s)]
*  and a Condé Nast Traveler review and they re-present it based on the best content that's out [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5164.639999999999s)]
*  there that they've already ranked because they have that algorithm with PageRank or Bing's ranking [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5171.44s)]
*  engine and then they re-publish it and then that jeopardizes those businesses that is profoundly [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5175.12s)]
*  unfair and not what we want for society. And they are interfering with their ability to leverage [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5180.08s)]
*  their own content is profoundly unfair and those magazines and newspapers need to- [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5184.88s)]
*  What's that? You're going to get steamrolled. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5190.48s)]
*  It's possible. YouTube is a great example. YouTube was going to get shut down. Sequoia [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5192.16s)]
*  and the YouTube founder sold it to Google because they were so scared of the Viacom lawsuit [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5197.76s)]
*  and how well it was working against them. They thought this business will never fly if we don't [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5202.64s)]
*  have a big partner like Google to support the lawsuit. They won the lawsuit or they settled it [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5208.72s)]
*  because they were able to do content ID and allow content creators. The only reason YouTube exists [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5215.2s)]
*  is- Hold on. Let me finish. It's because they let content creators watermark and find their stolen [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5221.04s)]
*  content and then claim it. And when they claim the stolen content, they were able to monetize it. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5226.64s)]
*  That's what's going to happen here. There'll be a settlement where they are going to be able to [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5231.6s)]
*  claim their content. There'll be no moaning. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5235.76s)]
*  I will bet any amount against your premonition here, J. Cal. This is the opposite of- [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5237.44s)]
*  Okay. Let's make a bet. Propose a bet. Propose a bet. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5242.24s)]
*  You've seen these AIs that generate images, right? Like stable diffusion and like Wally or whatever. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5245.759999999999s)]
*  You literally just tell it, I want this image in this style and boom, it's done. And it would take [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5250.5599999999995s)]
*  an artist weeks to produce that. And you can do it in five seconds and you could tell the AI, give [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5256.16s)]
*  me 20 of those. And then you just keep iterating and in five minutes, you've got something [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5261.44s)]
*  mind blowing. So the fact that it's so much easier to create content, you can do the same [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5265.6s)]
*  thing with the written word. The people who need to be compensated, J. Cal, if they don't get what [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5269.68s)]
*  they want, they may just go away, but there'll be 10 times or a hundred times more people- [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5273.280000000001s)]
*  Here's how wrong you are. Thank you for bringing up this example so that I can prove how wrong you [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5276.8s)]
*  are. Getty Images is suing stable diffusion at the moment. Here is what the dipshits at stable [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5281.4400000000005s)]
*  diffusion did. They train their AI on Getty Images with the watermarks on them and they've [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5286.96s)]
*  been busted and they are dead to rights now and they are going to pay a hundred million dollars or [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5292.64s)]
*  more to Getty Images for stealing their content and allowing it to be republished in a commercial [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5297.04s)]
*  setting. Those images don't look too good to me. Over time this will get resolved, J. Cal. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5303.76s)]
*  Stable diffusion copied the Getty Image watermark and put it on a reproduced work. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5309.200000000001s)]
*  I think stable diffusion's bigger problem is they can't do noses and ears and eyelids. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5316.240000000001s)]
*  That looks like a bigger problem to me. Anyway, shout out to stable diffusion for stealing Getty [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5322.88s)]
*  Image content. By the way, Mozart, influenced by Heide, not Beethoven. Sorry. By the way, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5327.200000000001s)]
*  there's a really interesting topic about AI that we don't have time to get to this week, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5333.76s)]
*  but I think we should put it on the docket for next week, which is should AIs be trained to lie? [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5337.76s)]
*  Super important. Because that's happening right now. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5343.280000000001s)]
*  Or have opinions. The last thing I'll say on this, from my perspective, maybe we can jump on after [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5347.68s)]
*  this, is this is the best thing that could happen for all of the monopolists in technology because [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5353.2s)]
*  Microsoft taking 500 or 600 basis points of share is the best way to ensure that the FTC has zero [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5359.599999999999s)]
*  credibility in going after Google or anybody else in tech. All of those things I think are DOA. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5364.639999999999s)]
*  In some ways, actually, Google leaking 5% or 6% of the market share is a really good thing because [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5370.639999999999s)]
*  the FTC is rendered toothless in making any claim that this is- [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5375.839999999999s)]
*  I'm assuming they understand that. That's such a good point. It's a good news, bad news scenario [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5379.04s)]
*  with this whole thing. The good news is that the Google monopoly has finally been cracked. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5384.0s)]
*  The bad news is that it's Microsoft and even bigger monopoly, that's the one that's done it. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5387.4400000000005s)]
*  But it just shows how vulnerable all these big tech companies are. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5392.240000000001s)]
*  TBD? [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5395.52s)]
*  TBD. And they may all end up competing with each other. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5395.84s)]
*  What's great is everyone's got a tactical nuclear weapon now and we don't know where it's going to [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5398.56s)]
*  get pointed and who's going to set it off and where. The weaponry has completely changed. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5403.2s)]
*  The weaponry totally changed. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5408.0s)]
*  And to prove how wrong you guys are, here is the verge. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5409.6s)]
*  Here we go. How many times have you said we were wrong? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5412.64s)]
*  Here's the other lawsuit. Open source writers- [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5414.96s)]
*  Nick, are you feeding him this nonsense? [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5418.8s)]
*  No. I've been tracking this. You people haven't. You guys need to watch what's happening right now. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5420.240000000001s)]
*  Co-pilot, GitHub, ChatGPT, and Microsoft are being sued by developers because co-pilot [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5426.16s)]
*  was built off of stolen content. These lawsuits are just beginning and it's going to result in [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5433.12s)]
*  licensing fees. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5440.08s)]
*  This will be a transitory effect and it won't change the dynamics of where this is going over [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5440.88s)]
*  the long term. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5444.8s)]
*  It changed the dynamics of YouTube in the long term, so let's keep going. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5445.2s)]
*  I don't know. They're doing pretty good. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5447.84s)]
*  We have a portfolio coming called Sourcegraph, which is building and- [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5449.68s)]
*  Why don't you just put your logo page up if you're going to go through the whole portfolio? [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5451.84s)]
*  No, they're building something similar. But it's opt-in. You just get all your customers to opt into [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5455.92s)]
*  it. Let's move on to the State of the Union. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5462.64s)]
*  What do you want to move on? You want to do the crackdown? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5465.52s)]
*  I think Sachs' point about AI SAs would be a great chat. Let's talk about it next week, though. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5468.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think it deserves more time. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5472.96s)]
*  The State of the Union, I don't know about you guys, but I found it one of the more profoundly [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5474.240000000001s)]
*  disappointing, saddening States of the Union I've ever seen. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5478.88s)]
*  Why? Unpack that. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5481.92s)]
*  Why? [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5482.72s)]
*  I think it was ... We often kind of focus on the one-year cycle of what the State of the Union says, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5483.76s)]
*  but I think what's more important is how much the data that's coming through in the State of the [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5488.96s)]
*  Union supports the more scary long-term cycle. I've talked about this a lot on how scared I am [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5492.72s)]
*  about kind of where we're headed with respect to the US's ability to fund its financial obligations. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5498.72s)]
*  The scary moment at the State of the Union, besides Biden's inability to kind of articulate [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5508.08s)]
*  much very well, which was honestly a really discouraging sight to see, was when he talked [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5512.72s)]
*  about the Republicans are trying to cut Social Security and Medicare, the US Treasury put out [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5519.84s)]
*  a projection, which I tweeted last week, originally shared on Twitter by Lynn Alden. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5525.360000000001s)]
*  This is the US Treasury's forecast of debt held by the United States over time. The assumptions in [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5531.280000000001s)]
*  this forecast are we've got a certain amount of debt today and we're running Social Security and [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5536.96s)]
*  Medicare forward without cuts. What happens as we make these Social Security Medicare payments [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5542.4s)]
*  and we accrue and pay interest on the debt that we hold today and we don't change the tax rates [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5547.92s)]
*  in this country? This is what happens. It's a runaway kind of debt scenario and the US, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5554.16s)]
*  by definition, has to default at some point because you cannot tax every dollar of the [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5559.6s)]
*  economy at 100% at some point. There are two ways this can go. The first way is you have to [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5564.8s)]
*  cut back on these major kind of expense commitments that naturally balloon over time and that is Social [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5572.400000000001s)]
*  Security and Medicare. The other one is that you just tax a lot more and when you tax a lot more, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5578.64s)]
*  economic growth gets affected and it makes it really hard to eventually pay off that debt [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5584.320000000001s)]
*  and the debt continues to spiral. So I think what we saw was number one, the announcement by Biden, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5588.4s)]
*  hey, Republicans are the ones who want to cut Social Security and Medicare and they all screamed [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5596.08s)]
*  and they said no way, no way, we'll never do that and a lot of them did interviews afterwards [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5599.92s)]
*  and said it's total BS if Biden would say that, which I think supports what the polls have shown, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5603.84s)]
*  which is on both sides of the aisle. People do not want to see Social Security and Medicare cut in [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5608.24s)]
*  any way right now. That means you can't, and you guys saw what happened in France where they pushed [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5613.36s)]
*  back the retirement age by two years and there was effectively riots across the country. I don't [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5617.36s)]
*  know if you guys saw this a few weeks ago. We didn't talk about it, but it was pretty brutal, [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5621.759999999999s)]
*  pretty ugly and so this is a real cost that's coming bare. It's coming bare in the United States, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5624.96s)]
*  not just with the publicly funded Social Security and Medicare programs, but also with a lot of the [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5630.719999999999s)]
*  private tensions that are going to need to get bailed out with the same federal money because [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5634.799999999999s)]
*  they're not going to let those things go bankrupt and that's another trillion plus of liabilities. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5638.0s)]
*  So that cost is going to balloon and the only solution at that point is to introduce massive [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5642.0s)]
*  tax hikes and so they propose this billionaire tax, this tax on unrecognized capital gains. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5647.84s)]
*  It is literally, if you keep Social Security and Medicare where they are and you don't pay [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5652.4s)]
*  down the debt and you don't grow the economy fast enough, you have to introduce significant tax hikes [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5655.6s)]
*  across corporate and the individual taxpayer base. Again, if you zoom out, it really indicates [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5660.96s)]
*  this steepening curve that the U.S. has to climb its way out of and as you tax more, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5669.36s)]
*  there's less to invest in the economic growth. The government is a far worse investor in economic [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5674.0s)]
*  growth than the free market and that means that we can't grow our way out and grow GDP enough to [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5678.48s)]
*  ultimately cover our debt obligations and this is what Dalio's book that I mentioned in 2021 [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5683.679999999999s)]
*  was so kind of importantly sharing. This is a multi-hundred year cycle and the last couple [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5689.679999999999s)]
*  decades get really nasty and this chart, which is a forecast from the actual U.S. Treasury, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5695.6s)]
*  highlights the problem and the comments made in front of the Congress this week by the President [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5700.72s)]
*  of the United States indicates how serious of a problem this is going to be because no one wants [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5704.96s)]
*  to cut these major cost obligations that we have coming due. And so what are you talking about? [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5709.4400000000005s)]
*  Saxt, aren't you and the Republicans, you want to cut Medicare and get rid of it. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5715.04s)]
*  Hell no. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5718.72s)]
*  Biden said you guys want to get rid of it. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5719.04s)]
*  What was that kerfuffle about with your, who's the person on your squad who is yelling and [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5721.68s)]
*  screaming out at the President of the United States? [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5725.92s)]
*  Oh, that doesn't matter. That was just sort of. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5727.84s)]
*  But who was screaming at him? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5729.92s)]
*  Who was that person? [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5731.2s)]
*  Let me tell you what happened in the State of the Union is that Biden was basically trying to [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5732.56s)]
*  take a page out of Bill Clinton's playbook. When Bill Clinton lost the midterms in 94, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5737.280000000001s)]
*  he basically triangulated to the center and he did two things. He started going for [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5743.12s)]
*  kind of small ball. He started playing small ball politics. It was like school uniforms [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5747.679999999999s)]
*  and things like that that were relatively unobjectionable and that regular middle class [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5753.12s)]
*  people could get behind. And then he basically posed as the defender of entitlement programs. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5757.599999999999s)]
*  Back then he in 96, he ran against Dole by portraying Dole. He went all the way back to [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5762.72s)]
*  Dole's vote against Medicare. This is what the Biden team is teeing up for the reelect in 24, [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5767.679999999999s)]
*  is they're talking about things like curbing ticket master fees and fixing right turn red [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5775.12s)]
*  lights. I mean, seriously, like total small ball. Okay. They're going to try and pretend [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5781.92s)]
*  like he wasn't the most radical tax and spend progressive over the last two years that we've [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5787.28s)]
*  really ever had in American history. They're going to try and make everyone forget that [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5792.0s)]
*  and just talk about the small, objectable stuff. And then he's also going to again, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5795.92s)]
*  pose as the stalwart defender of entitlement programs are very popular. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5799.5199999999995s)]
*  And it's, and partly they're doing this. They're ready, I think getting ready for [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5803.360000000001s)]
*  DeSantis on this, because if you read some of the political analysis on this and Josh Barrow had a [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5808.16s)]
*  good column and Andrew Sullivan had a good column talking about this, that way back when DeSantis [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5814.400000000001s)]
*  was in Congress and he was like a backbencher, he voted for some Republican budgets, a Paul Ryan [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5819.92s)]
*  budget that had some of this entitlement reform in it. So they're going to try and portray him [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5825.52s)]
*  as against the time reform. Now, I don't think it's going to work because all you have to say [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5830.56s)]
*  is like, listen, that was a long time ago. I wasn't voting for cutting entitlements. I just [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5834.64s)]
*  voted for my party's budget. That's irrelevant. I can tell you, I will not cut entitlements. So [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5839.360000000001s)]
*  any smart Republican is going to take entitlement reform off the table because it is a total third [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5844.88s)]
*  rail and they will lose. And I think Trump had the right instincts on this. And I'm sure that any [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5850.0s)]
*  major Republican will have the right instincts on this. You see the way they're throwing [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5856.400000000001s)]
*  Rick Scott under the bus. Rick Scott had this proposal about having entitlements go from being [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5860.32s)]
*  permanently entitled to being something that gets voted on every year. And the rest of the Republican [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5871.04s)]
*  caucus is like, hell no, we're not touching that. And they can't run away fast enough from Rick [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5876.08s)]
*  Scott. So Freeburg is right. There is no appetite for entitlement reform. And I would tell any [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5880.4s)]
*  Republican, if you want to do entitlement reform, it's got to be bipartisan. You've got to do it [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5886.08s)]
*  thoughts on the state of the union. You got to do what Ronald Reagan did, which is join hands [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5890.24s)]
*  with Tip O'Neill and Moynihan and you jump off the cliff together. Do not stick your neck out on this. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5893.92s)]
*  Jermoth, any thoughts on the state of the union writ large? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5900.08s)]
*  No. Marjorie Taller Green yelling liar at the president. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5905.04s)]
*  No. Okay, that's the most boring statement. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5910.48s)]
*  Well, you know, J. Cal, I mean, like both sides engaged in a lot of like weirdness. I mean, [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5912.72s)]
*  Biden was like bellowing at various points in his speech. It was quite bizarre. And you're right, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5918.72s)]
*  there were some Republicans, the audience who were braying like jackasses. And it's unfortunate [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5923.92s)]
*  because I think utterly, utterly disappointed. I think if the Republicans had just calmed down, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5928.96s)]
*  I think Biden's sort of weird mannerisms where he was like practically yelling, it was like Abe [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5933.52s)]
*  Simpson, you know, old man yelling at the cloud. Yeah, they do a good job of like right at the [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5939.92s)]
*  moment of self-immolation, they let him off the hook. It's really incredible. Republicans just, [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5945.28s)]
*  they have no impulse control. Right when they could just be quiet, sit there, calm, quiet, [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5950.32s)]
*  and let Biden do the damage to himself, they just cannot help themselves. I like McCarthy telling [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5956.64s)]
*  Marjorie Taller Green, shh, shh, and Mitt Romney telling that other liar guy to get the hell out [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5962.64s)]
*  of here. Listen, it's always been hard to control backbenchers. That's just the reality. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5967.2s)]
*  That does not speak for the entire party. How do you guys feel about being taxed on [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5971.679999999999s)]
*  your change in net worth from year to year? You mean a wealth tax? [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5978.72s)]
*  Wealth tax, yeah. If it's for billionaires, totally cool. If it's for centi-millionaires [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5982.72s)]
*  or deca-millionaires, absolutely off the table. We want those people to grow their wealth and [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5986.88s)]
*  invest. The billionaires, yeah, sure. Is that what you think is coming, Freberg? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5992.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. So hard to execute on. What are you supposed to do? I would love to see a website where you [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=5996.240000000001s)]
*  have a piece of yarn. You know those sites where you have a little pin and you kind of push the [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6001.04s)]
*  pin out and the other one has to go in. You can't have it all. You can't have low taxes and have [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6006.16s)]
*  these entitlement programs and have this level of spending. It's impossible. You have to tax. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6011.6s)]
*  That's the only way. Or you have to cut the entitlement programs or you have to cut the [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6017.84s)]
*  spending. Well, you're right about that, Freberg, but let me tell you why the American people [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6021.2s)]
*  think it would be ridiculous to cut their entitlements. They've watched [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6026.8s)]
*  as Washington spent $8 trillion on forever wars in the Middle East. They just watched [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6030.5599999999995s)]
*  as Biden spent trillions enriching the pharma companies on a fugazi that didn't work. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6036.8s)]
*  They've just watched as hundreds of billions went to climate special interests of the Democratic [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6043.2s)]
*  Party. Hold on. They've watched as trillions of dollars have gone to the donor class and they [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6048.08s)]
*  are going to rise up and say the hell with you if you cut off our social security that we paid into [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6061.84s)]
*  for decades while enriching all these special interests. I don't advocate for any of these [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6067.36s)]
*  points. And the bailouts of corporations in the great financial crisis. You're right. I think it's [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6072.64s)]
*  an analytical certainty that you got to zoom out and stop thinking about the yearly cycle [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6077.68s)]
*  and the election cycle on this stuff and just look at where we're headed over a multi-decade cycle. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6084.96s)]
*  And there's just no resolution to this problem. What happens if there is a wealth tax? [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6090.08s)]
*  If there is a wealth tax, let's just say on billionaires or... [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6095.04s)]
*  Let me just say one thing. Sorry, Jacob. What would they do? Would they leave the country? [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6098.8s)]
*  Go to Puerto Rico? That did happen in France, by the way. I think 40% of the people that were [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6102.16s)]
*  taxed left and then they came back. It would violate our constitution. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6106.0s)]
*  It'll be litigated for sure. If you can get the cost of energy in this country [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6111.92s)]
*  to drop by 50 to 75% and you can increase energy capacity by 10 to 20 fold, then you have a fighting [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6118.4s)]
*  chance because you can actually grow the economy out of the problem. And that's really where I am [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6127.28s)]
*  optimistic and excited about opportunities like Fusion and you guys can make fun of me all you want. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6131.44s)]
*  But if we can get to a point where we can increment energy capacity by an order of magnitude, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6135.52s)]
*  there is economic growth that will arise from that, from all these new industries and these [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6141.120000000001s)]
*  production systems. And that's how we can grow our way out of the debt entitlement tax problem, [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6144.96s)]
*  where one of those three things has to give in the absence of that. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6150.240000000001s)]
*  Do you know what the cheapest source of energy is today? Fusion. It's three cents a kilowatt hour. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6153.040000000001s)]
*  Fission, you mean? [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6161.68s)]
*  No, it's fusion. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6162.96s)]
*  It's the sun using solar panels. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6166.240000000001s)]
*  There it is. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6168.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the problem, Chimab, honestly, let me just say this one thing. The problem is, [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6169.280000000001s)]
*  can you scale energy capacity by 10x? And can you do it fast enough? And that's the real [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6172.56s)]
*  technical... [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6178.0s)]
*  While creating jobs. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6178.72s)]
*  That's the real techno economic question, right? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6179.84s)]
*  Yes. I posted a link in my reading list today. This week, you guys can go look at it. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6181.84s)]
*  The most prolific distribution of fusion technology is China actually deploying solar on [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6185.52s)]
*  every single rooftop in China. The United States could do it too, and you will 10x the power [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6191.52s)]
*  available. And it'll be zero. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6197.120000000001s)]
*  They're increasing. They're adding half a terawatt. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6200.240000000001s)]
*  It's just sometimes we want to create intellectual complexity. I love these different forms of [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6204.240000000001s)]
*  fusion. I just think it's a 50-year traj to get it because even if you fix the... [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6209.280000000001s)]
*  I'm not betting on it. I'm just saying there is a... [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6214.160000000001s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm just agreeing with you. I'm just building on your point to say it's [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6216.160000000001s)]
*  actually happening. Fusion is what is actually creating abundant zero-cost energy today. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6219.28s)]
*  Yeah. And so look, if we can increase energy capacity in this country by 10x, [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6224.96s)]
*  energy production capacity by 10x, and we can do it in the next 20 to 30 years... [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6228.96s)]
*  You can do it in 10 by putting solar on every rooftop. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6233.12s)]
*  If we can, we have a path out of the entitlement tax debt problem. Otherwise, [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6236.16s)]
*  one of those three things is going to give and it's going to be ugly. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6242.639999999999s)]
*  The thing that we are lacking right now is not actually the generation capability, [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6244.96s)]
*  which is incredibly cheap, but it's really scalable storage. And once we figure that out, [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6249.92s)]
*  which is actually the real technical bottleneck to abundant zero-cost energy, [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6254.64s)]
*  we'll have your boundary condition met and we'll have it well before [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6258.72s)]
*  different forms of fusion are commercializable. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6262.16s)]
*  France had an exodus of an estimated 42,000 millionaires between 2000 and 2012. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6265.44s)]
*  And really, and before McCrory killed it... [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6273.92s)]
*  Failing out the wealth tax for 12 years and then they reversed it. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6275.84s)]
*  They were just losing the tax base so violently, they had no choice. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6279.12s)]
*  It's happening in California. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6281.92s)]
*  That's what's going to happen in California if they move forward with this discussion. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6282.72s)]
*  It's happening in California already without the wealth tax. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6285.36s)]
*  Right. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6287.84s)]
*  It's happening already and now you look at it... [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6288.48s)]
*  Well, because they're stupidly telling people that this wealth tax is going to have a 10-year [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6290.08s)]
*  look forward. So everybody I know is at least talking about, hey, could this happen in the [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6294.0s)]
*  next 10 years? Because if it might happen five years from now, we got to leave now. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6298.16s)]
*  Because if I wait... [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6303.12s)]
*  They're going to chase you. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6304.24s)]
*  They're going to chase me. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6305.2s)]
*  Yeah. Specifically you. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6306.4s)]
*  They hate you. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6310.0s)]
*  No, I mean, it's a problem. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6310.5599999999995s)]
*  It is a serious problem. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6312.96s)]
*  Let me tell you, I mean, to Freberg's point, it's not just Ray Dalio, the great political [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6313.92s)]
*  satirist, Pedro O'Rourke, who died last year. He wrote that American politics is defined by the [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6318.4s)]
*  formula X minus Y equals a big stink, where X is what people want from government and Y equals [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6324.24s)]
*  what they're willing to pay for government. And that difference is basically the big stink. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6332.639999999999s)]
*  And the job of politicians is to manage that stink. And the problem is the politicians [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6336.96s)]
*  have not been doing a good job managing it and they increasingly do a worse job managing it. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6341.68s)]
*  So yeah, at some point it's going to blow up. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6346.88s)]
*  You guys want to hear a crazy statistic? I was pulling this up the other day. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6349.28s)]
*  You know what the budget per capita is of the city of San Francisco? [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6352.8s)]
*  So how much the city spends per year divided by the number of people that live in the city? [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6356.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, we know it's a couple of billion dollar budget. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6360.16s)]
*  We know only a couple of hundred thousand million dollar budget. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6361.92s)]
*  Yeah. And this 800,000 residents. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6364.56s)]
*  It's $18,000 per citizen per year. That's how much the city of San Francisco spends. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6366.400000000001s)]
*  A third of that money, by the way, 30% of it goes to, or 25% goes to public health care. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6372.56s)]
*  Now, when you look at that $18,000 budget per capita, it is more than every single state [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6377.92s)]
*  of the union on a per capita basis, except Oregon and North Dakota, which have very weird [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6384.56s)]
*  budget. So San Francisco spends more than every other state per capita. [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6389.84s)]
*  It spends more in aggregate than 16 US states. And the federal budget per capita is $15,000. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6394.88s)]
*  The federal government's budget per capita is $15,000. So San Francisco spends more than [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6401.76s)]
*  15 states and spends more per capita than every other state except to and spends more than the [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6406.56s)]
*  federal government per capita. And I think that really highlights and you need to tax the base [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6410.88s)]
*  to do that. And now we are seeing San Francisco is the largest population of exodus and population [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6415.68s)]
*  exodus of any city and business exodus of any city in the United States. That is your predictor. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6421.4400000000005s)]
*  That is your predictor of where this goes. Right. In Miami, Florida, my contrast has no state income [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6426.72s)]
*  tax. They just rely on property tax and sales tax, which California has as well. There is an [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6433.44s)]
*  income tax and cap gains tax of zero in Florida and they seem to make it work. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6439.599999999999s)]
*  880,000 people was the peak in San Francisco 2018, 2019, 2020. And then in 2021, 815. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6445.2s)]
*  It's gone even further in 2023. Some people think it's down to 615. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6456.48s)]
*  I think it is. Well, you have a lot of people who owned homes there and maybe owned second homes [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6460.16s)]
*  because let's face it, it was a well-heeled group of individuals living there. And a lot of them [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6465.2s)]
*  still have their places, but they've left and then they're in the process of selling their places. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6469.919999999999s)]
*  The point is increasing the tax rate is a great short-term solution. But over the long term, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6474.32s)]
*  if that budget per citizen isn't brought in line, there is no way to tax the base enough [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6479.759999999999s)]
*  without causing the tax base to leave. Forget about what anyone's personal opinions are. That's [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6485.2s)]
*  just the economic reality of what happened in France. It's what's happening in San Francisco. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6489.44s)]
*  There's a lot of great predictors in history of where this has happened. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6493.5199999999995s)]
*  And so something has to give, or you have to have a miracle like an energy miracle, but [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6496.88s)]
*  we'll all keep investing for that. All right, everybody. This has been an amazing, [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6501.76s)]
*  amazing episode of the All In Podcast. 115 episodes for the dictator, [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6506.16s)]
*  sultan of science, and for the pacifist, David the Dove Sax. I am the world's [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6513.28s)]
*  greatest moderator, J Cal, and we'll see you next time. Bye-bye. Love you, besties. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6520.8s)]
*  I'm doing all in. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVgBWV2bvLs&t=6573.28s)]
