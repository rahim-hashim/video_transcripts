**All In Podcast:** [June 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70)
*  Hey everybody, welcome to the All In podcast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm your moderator for the week, Dave Friedberg. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3.24s)]
*  Not the world's greatest moderator. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6.34s)]
*  This show is gonna be a bit of a shortened version. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=8.32s)]
*  At the back end of the pod today, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=10.96s)]
*  we actually are gonna show some Q&A [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=13.64s)]
*  from Jason's launch summit, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=15.92s)]
*  which he held in Napa Valley this week. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=17.38s)]
*  Great event, thanks for having us up there. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=19.2s)]
*  J Cal. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=21.56s)]
*  Thanks for coming. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=22.64s)]
*  Great speakers, great content, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=23.46s)]
*  and we did a live Q&A for the All In pod [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=25.2s)]
*  with the audience there, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=29.779999999999998s)]
*  which we'll transition to about halfway [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=31.22s)]
*  through the show today. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=33.46s)]
*  J Cal, thanks for your hospitality. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=34.9s)]
*  Oh, yeah, thanks for coming. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=36.699999999999996s)]
*  Thanks for throwing the fun birthday party, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=37.54s)]
*  the poker night, we had a great time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=40.58s)]
*  I still don't know what I was doing there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=42.26s)]
*  You were meeting some of your LPs [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=43.98s)]
*  who you'd never met before. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=45.58s)]
*  It was like a dog and pony show. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=46.94s)]
*  J Cal was using us as some sort of dog and pony show [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=48.64s)]
*  to raise money. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=50.86s)]
*  Zach, did you really have LPs there [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=51.980000000000004s)]
*  that you had never met? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=53.58s)]
*  No. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=54.7s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=55.54s)]
*  Hold on a second, I had one LP there [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=56.82s)]
*  who I have definitely met many times before. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=58.66s)]
*  Okay, she told us she'd never met you, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=60.58s)]
*  she wanted an introduction. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=62.13999999999999s)]
*  So maybe she's getting into the spirit of All In [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=63.459999999999994s)]
*  and joking with you, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=65.34s)]
*  but you had a three hour meeting with one of your LPs, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=66.17999999999999s)]
*  I heard. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=67.89999999999999s)]
*  She talked about it the next day. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=68.74s)]
*  Yeah, she said she had like two or three hours with you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=69.97999999999999s)]
*  Chamath, are you with us today? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=71.82s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=72.64s)]
*  You there, buddy? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=73.47999999999999s)]
*  Chamath was very drunk, by the way. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=74.32s)]
*  He brought up his own wine, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=75.14s)]
*  he started margaritas at two o'clock. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=75.97999999999999s)]
*  He was drunk by the time we got there. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=77.5s)]
*  What? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=79.14s)]
*  He showed up at like two in the afternoon. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=79.97999999999999s)]
*  He was day drinking margaritas in the sun, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=81.46s)]
*  and then we showed up and he was like falling asleep [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=84.1s)]
*  by the time we were done with the stage. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=86.08s)]
*  So I said, I love you guys. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=87.3s)]
*  Good job. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=88.76s)]
*  I'm here. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  ["I'm Going All In"] [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=91.72s)]
*  Let your winter slide. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=92.8s)]
*  Rain Man, David Sack. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=96.06s)]
*  And it said we open sourced it to the fans [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=100.66s)]
*  and they've just gone crazy with it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=102.66s)]
*  Love you best. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=104.30000000000001s)]
*  Queen of Ken Wann. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=105.14s)]
*  You know, by the way, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=108.52000000000001s)]
*  politics is one of these incredible things [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=109.36s)]
*  where you see the meanest people come out of the woodwork [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=111.56s)]
*  when you even feign support for somebody [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=116.74s)]
*  that they don't support. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=120.22s)]
*  Now that it's out there that Sacks and I [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=121.41999999999999s)]
*  are doing this fundraiser for RFK. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=123.78s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=126.33999999999999s)]
*  If you look at Twitter, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  some of like the democratic surrogates are out [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=128.2s)]
*  just smacking me and Sacks around. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=133.5s)]
*  And it's incredible because these people [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=136.64s)]
*  are like the biggest imposter loser clowns. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=140.34s)]
*  They've never literally done anything in their whole life. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=144.8s)]
*  And then they show up and then they just like, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=147.70000000000002s)]
*  how dare you work and help build a company? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=150.06s)]
*  How dare you help build another company? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=152.54000000000002s)]
*  How dare you help now fund other companies? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=155.22s)]
*  I am a talking mouthpiece who's never done anything [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=157.74s)]
*  except work in one administration as a speechwriter. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=159.86s)]
*  And now I think you guys suck balls. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=162.18s)]
*  It's like, give me a break. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=164.42000000000002s)]
*  So are you a little kind of emotional about that today? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=167.54000000000002s)]
*  I love, I actually, I love critiques actually. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=170.34s)]
*  Because I think like you can learn a lot from critiques, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=172.42s)]
*  but then when mids just spew, I just get annoyed. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  I think mids should not be allowed to talk. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=180.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=182.83999999999997s)]
*  Well- [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=183.72s)]
*  That's just my thought. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=184.56s)]
*  There goes half the internet. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  Sacks, are your Republican cohort friends upset [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=186.22s)]
*  about you hosting a fundraiser for RFK? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  I've gotten none of that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  None of that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  That's interesting. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  What's your take on that? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, do Republicans generally think that it's a good thing [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=197.64s)]
*  if RFK Jr. gets the Democratic nomination [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=200.58s)]
*  because he will be easily beatable? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=202.88s)]
*  I don't think they're thinking that way. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=204.38s)]
*  I think that there's a respect for RFK Jr. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=205.74s)]
*  among many Republicans, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=211.3s)]
*  because he's speaking out on issues that they care about. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=212.32s)]
*  Like I've talked about, he's denouncing censorship, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=214.74s)]
*  he's in favor of free speech, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=217.5s)]
*  he's in favor of civil liberties, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=218.92000000000002s)]
*  and not this massive surveillance state, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=220.9s)]
*  he's speaking out in favor of peace instead of war. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=223.94s)]
*  He's speaking out on the border. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=226.78s)]
*  He had this amazing video. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=227.96s)]
*  That was great. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=229.8s)]
*  A couple of days ago, where he went to the border [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=230.62s)]
*  in Yuma, Arizona at 2 a.m. in the morning. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=233.0s)]
*  At 2 a.m. in the morning, yeah. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=236.0s)]
*  And he shows where the border wall ends. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=237.04s)]
*  And where the border wall ends, the line begins. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=240.32s)]
*  And people from all over the world are just entering [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=243.48s)]
*  through this hole in the wall [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=246.6s)]
*  in a never-ending stream of people. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=247.96s)]
*  And then they get loaded onto buses [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=250.72s)]
*  provided by the government, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=253.48s)]
*  and then they get handed a ticket [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=255.2s)]
*  to supposedly appear in court [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=257.06s)]
*  to resolve their case in three or four years. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=258.58000000000004s)]
*  And they're never heard from again, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=261.26000000000005s)]
*  and they're dispersed all over the country. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=262.38s)]
*  What I don't understand is, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=264.26000000000005s)]
*  if the federal government can get its act together enough [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=265.58000000000004s)]
*  to provide buses, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=268.94s)]
*  why can't they get their act together enough [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=270.78000000000003s)]
*  to plug the hole in the wall? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=272.82000000000005s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=274.66s)]
*  This is like an act of sabotage against the United States. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=275.88s)]
*  And so he's there just pointing this out. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=279.1s)]
*  I've never seen anything like this before. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=280.70000000000005s)]
*  It was interesting as a Democrat to do this, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=282.74s)]
*  because that's typically kind of a Republican point, right? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=285.36s)]
*  And some of the commentary made about RFK Jr., [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=289.58000000000004s)]
*  I think it was in the New York Times this week, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=292.42s)]
*  or someone that covered his candidacy, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=294.6s)]
*  one of the big media companies, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=297.1s)]
*  highlighted how much of his agenda [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=300.42s)]
*  seems to be a Republican talking point agenda. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=303.58000000000004s)]
*  Does that sound accurate to you? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=306.26s)]
*  Or is that just kind of a- [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=308.18s)]
*  I think even most people in the country [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=309.02000000000004s)]
*  who identify as Democrats [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  would be against having an open border. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=312.82s)]
*  That's what we're talking about. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=316.09999999999997s)]
*  When there's a hole in the wall [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=316.94s)]
*  and people can just start forming a line, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=317.76s)]
*  and then once they get through the line, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=318.86s)]
*  they're literally just, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=321.14s)]
*  hold on, they're basically distributed [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=322.42s)]
*  throughout the country on buses. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=323.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't think most people in the country, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=325.34s)]
*  even Democrats, would support that. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=326.7s)]
*  But what he's violating here is the press blackout [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=328.62s)]
*  on what's really going on at the border. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=332.96s)]
*  So you're right, like the only- [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=335.34s)]
*  Yeah, he went there. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=336.18s)]
*  He went there, yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=337.02s)]
*  But other Republican talking points, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=337.84s)]
*  so the points around the vaccine, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=339.34s)]
*  the points around- [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=343.7s)]
*  The Republican, well, he's expressed, obviously, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=344.56s)]
*  concerns about vaccines preceding the COVID vaccine. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=346.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't know whether he's right about that or not. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=349.44s)]
*  We're not willing to say whether he's right [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=351.44s)]
*  or wrong about that, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=352.8s)]
*  because I just don't know enough. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=353.64000000000004s)]
*  I think he's definitely right [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=354.48s)]
*  about the inefficacy of the COVID vaccine. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=356.36s)]
*  We've talked about this before. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=358.76000000000005s)]
*  Even Bill Gates admits now that the vaccine doesn't work. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=359.8s)]
*  It's too short-acting, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=362.8s)]
*  and it doesn't hold up against variants. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  It's not a vaccine. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=366.0s)]
*  Let's just call it what it was. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  It's not a vaccine. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=368.24s)]
*  It doesn't prevent you from getting the illness. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  It's a death reduction shot. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=369.92s)]
*  It was a revenue grab by Big Pharma, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=371.64000000000004s)]
*  plastered with non-scientific thinking [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=375.09999999999997s)]
*  from a bunch of people who should have known better. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=378.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=381.21999999999997s)]
*  Okay, I think you just got our- [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=382.06s)]
*  So much for- [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=384.14s)]
*  YouTube channel censored. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=384.98s)]
*  No, that's- [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=385.82s)]
*  But this is just the truth. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=386.64s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=387.7s)]
*  What Chamath just said is just the factual reality, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=388.54s)]
*  and you can't get that from the mainstream media. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=390.82s)]
*  There's no reevaluation. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=394.74s)]
*  There's no appraisal. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=396.38s)]
*  They control what we see and hear. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=397.36s)]
*  It's like Pravda level in terms of the propaganda. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=400.12s)]
*  And that's why I think RFK Jr. is so interesting [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=402.79999999999995s)]
*  is because he is blowing up [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  what the mainstream media wants to control. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=407.96s)]
*  The really interesting thing about him going to the border, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=410.55999999999995s)]
*  I agree with Sax, is, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=412.52s)]
*  hey, let's just have a discussion about this [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=413.76s)]
*  and look at the actual facts on the ground [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=415.64s)]
*  that we can agree on. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=417.55999999999995s)]
*  And what he actually did was he pierced the veil of like, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  this is an issue about a certain group of people. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=422.11999999999995s)]
*  He was there, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=424.52s)]
*  and there are people from Afghanistan, China, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=425.35999999999996s)]
*  all over the world coming in. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=427.11999999999995s)]
*  He made the point that this isn't just about one country [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=428.35999999999996s)]
*  and that these people are suffering. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=430.46s)]
*  And that I thought was like another [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=433.18s)]
*  really important highlight. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=434.02s)]
*  These people are being trafficked. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=435.02s)]
*  They're being abused at the border, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  and that it's gonna cost us 10 million a mile [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=439.18s)]
*  to secure the border. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=441.5s)]
*  It's a humanitarian crisis. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=442.34s)]
*  He had a really good way of talking about it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=443.18s)]
*  And he's done this with Ukraine as well, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=444.46s)]
*  where he emphasizes the humanitarian aspect of it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=446.65999999999997s)]
*  Yes, which I believe. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=450.06s)]
*  And it's a good way of talking about it, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=450.9s)]
*  and I think Republicans should adopt some of that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=452.41999999999996s)]
*  He rhetoric. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=455.9s)]
*  And to Chamath's point, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=456.78s)]
*  I think it's a money grab Chamath. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=457.78s)]
*  I do think it lowered death rates, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=460.5s)]
*  but I do think piercing the veil on this and- [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=461.9s)]
*  None of us are still getting boosted [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=464.91999999999996s)]
*  because we know they don't work. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=466.32s)]
*  Guys, guys, stop. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  Okay, let's keep moving on. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=468.0s)]
*  I'm not debating vaccines and politics. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=468.82s)]
*  We're moving on. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=470.67999999999995s)]
*  We're gonna talk about crypto. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=471.52s)]
*  So this week, the SEC- [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=472.34s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  Serious action against Binance and Coinbase. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=474.97999999999996s)]
*  Pretty significant, pretty loud. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=480.32s)]
*  SEC filed 13 charges against Binance entities [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=482.12s)]
*  and the founders of CC. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=484.9s)]
*  Charges include operating unregistered securities exchanges, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=486.44s)]
*  broker dealers and clearing agencies, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=489.97999999999996s)]
*  misrepresenting their trading controls and their oversight [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=491.91999999999996s)]
*  on the Binance US platform [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=495.21999999999997s)]
*  and the unregistered offer and sale of securities. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=497.38s)]
*  The next day, they sought a temporary restraining order [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=500.35999999999996s)]
*  to freeze Binance's US assets. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=503.08s)]
*  And then on Tuesday, the SEC sued Coinbase [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=506.02s)]
*  over their exchange and their staking programs. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=509.74s)]
*  Stock dropped 12%. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=512.64s)]
*  The SEC said that the company was operating [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=514.74s)]
*  an unregistered exchange and broker [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=518.9s)]
*  and that 13 of their assets listed on their platform [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=520.26s)]
*  were considered crypto asset securities. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=523.46s)]
*  Brian Armstrong obviously has been on the pod several times, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=526.72s)]
*  said he's not shutting down his staking service [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=530.78s)]
*  and said, regarding the SEC complaint against us today, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=533.78s)]
*  we're proud to represent the industry in court [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=536.22s)]
*  to finally get some clarity around crypto rules. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=538.1s)]
*  He's generally made the statement [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=540.14s)]
*  that he has tried multiple times to register with the SEC. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=541.9399999999999s)]
*  They have not had a mechanism for him to register. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=544.66s)]
*  They have tried to do everything by the book [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=548.24s)]
*  and that the SEC approved their IPO filing [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=549.96s)]
*  knowing full well the details of their business [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=553.4s)]
*  and their operating model [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=555.72s)]
*  and still allowed them to go public [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=557.12s)]
*  on a US securities exchange [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=558.96s)]
*  despite full knowledge about their business. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=561.64s)]
*  Chamath, does anything change this week [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=563.6s)]
*  based on the SEC's action [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=565.08s)]
*  or is this just a continuation of crypto has been rolled back [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=566.28s)]
*  and will continue to roll back here in the US [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=573.88s)]
*  or is this something new and a new action [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=577.38s)]
*  and opens up a new front on the government versus crypto? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=579.3s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=583.62s)]
*  I think there's two ways to look at this. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=584.46s)]
*  One is the conspiracy theorist way [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=586.02s)]
*  which you see a lot of on Twitter, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=589.5s)]
*  which is this idea that crypto is making [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=594.8199999999999s)]
*  all of these inroads as a replacement mechanism [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=597.54s)]
*  for fiat currency [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=602.98s)]
*  and so governments are really now invested [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=605.22s)]
*  in trying to shut it down. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=608.44s)]
*  I think that's largely untrue. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=610.24s)]
*  And then there's the more simple basic reality [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=613.1600000000001s)]
*  which is that there was one part of the SEC [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=616.52s)]
*  that frankly didn't do the job that they were supposed to [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=620.1s)]
*  by either allowing a few of these crypto companies [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=623.2s)]
*  or crypto businesses to go public [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=625.64s)]
*  either as standalone businesses [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=628.08s)]
*  or as part of other businesses, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=629.5400000000001s)]
*  so Coinbase, Robinhood, et cetera. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=631.1600000000001s)]
*  And then there's this part of the enforcement action [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=635.3000000000001s)]
*  after this FTX fiasco, which is a lot of CYA [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=637.98s)]
*  covering your ass by the SEC, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=642.24s)]
*  especially because it looked like [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=644.74s)]
*  they had some cozy relationships with them. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=645.96s)]
*  And so they're coming down hard [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=648.4200000000001s)]
*  and they're going to go and systematically dismantle [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=649.98s)]
*  the largest actors [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=653.34s)]
*  and they're going to go through the value chain. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=654.78s)]
*  So I think the obvious place that they're looking now [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=656.74s)]
*  are the exchanges, they'll look at the custodial services, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=659.9s)]
*  they will not approve any ETFs. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=665.74s)]
*  And then eventually I do think it trickles [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=668.58s)]
*  into all of the staking services. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=670.74s)]
*  And eventually I think it'll touch the venture community [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=673.4s)]
*  and all of those firms and funds [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=676.26s)]
*  that had a huge robust business [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=678.86s)]
*  in staking these crypto projects in order to get coins, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=681.34s)]
*  like founding coins and then being able to sell them. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=687.4200000000001s)]
*  J. Cal. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=690.38s)]
*  I mean, I've been talking about this since the beginning [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=691.3000000000001s)]
*  because I bought Bitcoin and wrote about Bitcoin [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=693.26s)]
*  when it was maybe 25 cents. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=696.9s)]
*  And then again, when it was a hundred. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=698.66s)]
*  So I've been following this for a long time. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=700.62s)]
*  And I think thinking from first principles [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=702.74s)]
*  to stepping back for a moment, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=705.02s)]
*  what we do in technology is fundamentally disruptive [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=706.62s)]
*  if it's at its best, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=709.64s)]
*  if it's truly going to be important in the world. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=710.64s)]
*  And when you hear that word disruption, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=712.9s)]
*  you kind of file it as a buzzword, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=714.4399999999999s)]
*  but what it really means at its core is like competition. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=716.86s)]
*  And it's not just competition disruption. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=721.02s)]
*  When you say disruption, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=724.22s)]
*  you're talking about existential competition. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=725.0600000000001s)]
*  Two people go in the ring, one person comes out. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=725.9s)]
*  Like somebody's going to get really fucked up. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=727.78s)]
*  And if you, people keep bringing up, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=730.86s)]
*  oh, you're an investor at Uber, they broke the rules, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=732.78s)]
*  they bent the rules. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=734.82s)]
*  Uber was going against caps. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=736.4200000000001s)]
*  Airbnb was going against like hotels. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=738.1s)]
*  WeWork was going against like long-term real estate leases. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=740.48s)]
*  When you look at all those disruptive technologies [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=743.84s)]
*  and what they did at their core, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=747.02s)]
*  they disrupted on behalf of consumers [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=748.6600000000001s)]
*  and lowered prices, increased choice, et cetera. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=752.54s)]
*  When you get crypto, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=754.6999999999999s)]
*  the crypto crowd literally said, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=756.5799999999999s)]
*  we are going to replace fiat currency. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=758.66s)]
*  Fiat currency is the government. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=760.86s)]
*  And so my thesis from the beginning was, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=763.9s)]
*  if the government has a way to stop this, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=765.4s)]
*  they do not want to be disrupted. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=767.38s)]
*  What is a government at its core? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=769.42s)]
*  It's a military, it's a bunch of rules, laws, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=771.5799999999999s)]
*  and it's money. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=776.2199999999999s)]
*  That's the kind of pillars of any government's power. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=778.18s)]
*  We knew the government wasn't going to give this up. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=782.96s)]
*  And they effed around and found out, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=784.72s)]
*  but the truth is the, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=788.0600000000001s)]
*  and this is where I have some sympathy for the crypto people, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=789.96s)]
*  not the people who are just committing crime [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=792.5200000000001s)]
*  with the hallway and just dumping these bags [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=794.1400000000001s)]
*  on retail, et cetera. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=795.9200000000001s)]
*  But we do want to have this innovation here. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=797.32s)]
*  There are some innovative aspects to it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=799.46s)]
*  But Gary Gensler said, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=801.46s)]
*  listen, you already have electronic money. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=802.3000000000001s)]
*  It's called money in the United States. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=804.0400000000001s)]
*  We already have these services. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=805.7s)]
*  You don't need this. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=806.62s)]
*  Consumers don't need it. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=807.46s)]
*  And you have to understand the SEC's function in the world [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=808.2800000000001s)]
*  to understand why they're taking this action. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=811.88s)]
*  Their function is to protect investors. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=813.24s)]
*  Investors lost a bunch of money. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=815.96s)]
*  Therefore, they are going to retroactively inflict pain [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=817.36s)]
*  and hold people accountable for their mandate, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=820.68s)]
*  which is to protect investors. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=824.08s)]
*  You could have easily resolved this, the SEC. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=826.02s)]
*  And the companies could resolve this. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=829.88s)]
*  The companies could have followed these things as securities [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=831.92s)]
*  and only allowed accredited investors. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=833.88s)]
*  Top 5% of the country, people will make over 200K a year. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=835.8s)]
*  They didn't do that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=838.72s)]
*  They said anybody can buy these. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=839.96s)]
*  Well, that's just not how it works in America. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=842.2800000000001s)]
*  And it should change. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=845.12s)]
*  I think everybody should be able to buy any security [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=846.6s)]
*  they want in America, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=848.9200000000001s)]
*  just like anybody can go play blackjack. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=849.76s)]
*  And the easiest solution for this, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=851.6s)]
*  just passed in Congress this week, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=852.88s)]
*  and we'll go to the Senate and be a lawsuit, I think, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=854.4000000000001s)]
*  allowing every American, the other 94%, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=856.9200000000001s)]
*  to take a test and become accredited. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=859.0400000000001s)]
*  If that happens, you take a test [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=860.76s)]
*  just like you take a driver's license test. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=862.6800000000001s)]
*  I know what diversification is. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=863.98s)]
*  I know how risky these are. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=865.32s)]
*  Once you take that 50 question test, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=867.0400000000001s)]
*  you become accredited, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=869.44s)]
*  and then you can buy these coins if you want to. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=870.2800000000001s)]
*  And that's really the easiest path to resolution here. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=872.44s)]
*  So we don't have Brian Armstrong move his company [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=874.8800000000001s)]
*  to the Middle East or an island in the Caribbean, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=877.6400000000001s)]
*  which is what he's gonna do, I predict. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=880.24s)]
*  Okay, well, look, we've seen this bill make its way, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=882.6s)]
*  I think, through, is it going to the Senate next, or is it? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=886.5200000000001s)]
*  Going to the Senate, yeah. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=889.84s)]
*  Going to the Senate next. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=891.2s)]
*  So let's see if it gets done. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=892.0400000000001s)]
*  I think it's a good point. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=893.6s)]
*  One thing I'll point out, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=895.04s)]
*  when individual investors were making money [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=897.12s)]
*  because all of these asset values were inflating, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=901.36s)]
*  all of the coins were growing, were climbing in value, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=904.04s)]
*  everyone felt good, there was an emergent cry [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=906.9399999999999s)]
*  that we all wanna have access to these new instruments. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=911.0s)]
*  We all have a right to make these investments [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=913.92s)]
*  and to own these assets. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=916.98s)]
*  And then as the asset values declined [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=918.74s)]
*  and individual investors began losing money, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=921.8s)]
*  the emergent cry is, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=924.28s)]
*  where was the government to help save and protect us? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=925.96s)]
*  And so the SEC, I would argue, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=930.0s)]
*  was probably a little bit hindered [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=931.6800000000001s)]
*  when the market was inflating [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=934.28s)]
*  in being able to step in and take action, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=935.76s)]
*  because that would have been counter [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=937.48s)]
*  to the cries of the retail market. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=939.9s)]
*  But as the retail market took their hits, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=942.6s)]
*  the SEC has to step in and Congress steps in [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=945.44s)]
*  and everyone starts to say, it's time to act, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=947.72s)]
*  we should have acted sooner. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=950.24s)]
*  And this was fairly predictable. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=951.76s)]
*  I think what's happening is more nefarious than that. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=953.72s)]
*  So the SEC is doing two different things. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=956.52s)]
*  They're alleging two different kinds of crimes. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=959.5600000000001s)]
*  One set has to do with protecting investors [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=964.4s)]
*  from having their funds stolen on these exchanges [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=969.26s)]
*  or at least commingled. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=973.44s)]
*  FTX did that, right, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=974.6800000000001s)]
*  where they basically took customer deposits and stole them. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=975.6800000000001s)]
*  What Binance is accused of is taking customer deposits, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=978.2s)]
*  maybe not stealing them, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=981.22s)]
*  but commingling them with company funds. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=982.2199999999999s)]
*  That should be looked at, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=984.4599999999999s)]
*  and I think crypto customers should be protected [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=985.9799999999999s)]
*  against that. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=988.7399999999999s)]
*  However, the case against Coinbase, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=989.5799999999999s)]
*  they're alleging a completely different set of facts, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=991.3399999999999s)]
*  which is effectively what Gensler and the SEC are saying [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=993.02s)]
*  is that it is not legal to operate a crypto exchange [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=996.66s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=999.78s)]
*  That is what the SEC is saying, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1001.06s)]
*  because Coinbase has basically done everything right. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1003.2199999999999s)]
*  And I believe that Gensler is far exceeding his authority [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1005.5999999999999s)]
*  in stating something like that. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1008.66s)]
*  It is not up to the chairman of the SEC [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1009.78s)]
*  to say that Americans should not be holding crypto. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1013.22s)]
*  Why, as a free people, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1016.22s)]
*  should we not be able to buy crypto if we want to? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1017.54s)]
*  Why shouldn't we be able to buy Bitcoin? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1022.0600000000001s)]
*  Now, maybe you apply rules around accredited investor status. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1023.38s)]
*  There should be protections [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1027.94s)]
*  against unsophisticated investors buying stuff [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1028.9s)]
*  or getting defrauded. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1031.5s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1032.74s)]
*  That's the framework that Brian Armstrong is asking for. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1033.64s)]
*  But everyone should understand [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1036.86s)]
*  what the SEC is doing right now [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1039.1399999999999s)]
*  is basically usurping congressional authority. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1040.54s)]
*  It should be Congress that makes the law. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1043.8999999999999s)]
*  If Congress wants to ban crypto exchanges [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1046.3799999999999s)]
*  in the United States [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1048.8999999999999s)]
*  and prevent the citizen of the United States [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1049.74s)]
*  from owning crypto, let Congress do it. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1051.6599999999999s)]
*  It should not be up to Gensler to do that. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1053.4599999999998s)]
*  And the question is, why is Gensler going this far [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1056.2199999999998s)]
*  when previously he had relationships in the industry? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1059.4199999999998s)]
*  Apparently he was a consultant to Binance, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1061.74s)]
*  and even worse, he was talking to FTX [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1065.4s)]
*  about giving them some special status. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1067.68s)]
*  And I think the reason is that the scuttlebutt [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1069.88s)]
*  is that he has an alliance with Elizabeth Warren, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1072.2s)]
*  and the rumor is that she will make him Treasury Secretary [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1075.96s)]
*  if he basically destroys crypto in the US. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1079.0400000000002s)]
*  Sorry, where is the evidence for that? [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1080.76s)]
*  That's just someone's rumor and speculation? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1082.26s)]
*  This is the scuttlebutt in the industry. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1084.24s)]
*  Okay, so it's someone- [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1086.44s)]
*  The back channel. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1087.2800000000002s)]
*  This is, in fact, the back channel. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1088.96s)]
*  So just to be clear, rumor and innuendo is what you're saying. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1090.52s)]
*  No, look, what I would say is clear [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1093.44s)]
*  is that Gensler and Elizabeth Warren have an alliance [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1095.7s)]
*  to destroy crypto in the US. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1097.94s)]
*  This was speculated about before with Operation Chokepoint, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1099.5600000000002s)]
*  but now it's clear. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1102.38s)]
*  They're trying to shut down. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1103.98s)]
*  What is Operation Chokepoint? [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1104.8200000000002s)]
*  We've talked about on the show before, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1106.0200000000002s)]
*  it was a series of actions taken. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1107.22s)]
*  It's what you do when you're in a hotel at night. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1108.5400000000002s)]
*  Oh! [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1110.94s)]
*  Operation Chokepoint was a series of actions [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1113.3000000000002s)]
*  by the US government to basically destroy [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1115.22s)]
*  all the onramps to crypto, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1117.0400000000002s)]
*  so you couldn't get money into the system. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1118.98s)]
*  Now they're going further, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1120.76s)]
*  and they're basically saying it is illegal [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1121.7800000000002s)]
*  to operate a crypto exchange in the United States. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1123.78s)]
*  So Gensler has now played his cards. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1126.3799999999999s)]
*  That's not exactly what they're saying. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1127.22s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1128.74s)]
*  Gensler has played his cards. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1129.58s)]
*  I can explain why you're wrong. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1130.42s)]
*  What they're saying is it's not just the exchange. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1132.5s)]
*  It's that the exchange contains unregistered security. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1134.48s)]
*  So it's a more nuanced point. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1138.42s)]
*  I think, I agree- [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1139.68s)]
*  What security could you trade? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1141.5s)]
*  Well, if it passes the Howie test or it is registered, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1143.3s)]
*  and there are people who have actually registered their crypto. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1146.78s)]
*  They're saying that no crypto passes the Howie test. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1148.86s)]
*  Nope. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1151.06s)]
*  They're going back on that. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1151.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to pass it. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1152.76s)]
*  If you limited it to accredited investors, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1153.6000000000001s)]
*  and the fact is, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1155.88s)]
*  Brian Armstrong, Binance, and a lot of crypto projects [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1157.48s)]
*  refused to exclude non-accredited investors. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1161.48s)]
*  And I watched this happen up close and personal. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1166.32s)]
*  Well, this is not- [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1167.84s)]
*  I had many- [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1168.68s)]
*  You're right about the unregistered securities thing. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1169.5s)]
*  They're trying to say that all crypto [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1171.4s)]
*  is unregistered securities. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1173.3600000000001s)]
*  No, no, they said very specifically- [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1174.48s)]
*  You can't get around that by being a criminal. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1175.32s)]
*  No, no, they literally, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1176.16s)]
*  they named them SACs in the lawsuit. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1177.4s)]
*  They named the 16 or 13, what was it, Friedberg? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1179.76s)]
*  They know how to, it was 13, they know how to craft this. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1183.1200000000001s)]
*  They're saying for these specific 13. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1185.3600000000001s)]
*  Now the industry does feel you're correct, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1187.3200000000002s)]
*  and the back channel is everybody's against us. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1189.8400000000001s)]
*  But if they had just registered these, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1192.0800000000002s)]
*  they would not have a problem. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1193.96s)]
*  I don't think they're going to- [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1194.8s)]
*  I think wasn't- [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1196.0s)]
*  Bitcoin is not included in this. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1196.8400000000001s)]
*  Ethereum is not included. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1198.4s)]
*  He doesn't have a way of registering. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1200.28s)]
*  They do. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1202.88s)]
*  They don't want to. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1203.72s)]
*  So they claim they don't have a way of registering. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1204.88s)]
*  They could register it just like we all do [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1207.0s)]
*  when we have private securities. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1208.68s)]
*  There's been a lot of people tweeting about this, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1209.8s)]
*  that the SEC has put out statements saying, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1211.2s)]
*  our door is open, come talk to us. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1213.32s)]
*  There is no open door. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1215.32s)]
*  There is no one to talk to. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1216.4s)]
*  They have no idea how to get registered. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1217.6399999999999s)]
*  How, Chamath, how do you think this is going to get resolved? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1220.2s)]
*  Armstrong's talked publicly about going to Congress [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1222.32s)]
*  to try and get some clarifying law passed. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1225.04s)]
*  Are you familiar with any of the, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1226.92s)]
*  any of the drafting that might be going on [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1230.68s)]
*  to support his cause here? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1232.32s)]
*  Or do you think it's going to get settled in the courts? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1234.4s)]
*  First of all, I think Brian Armstrong [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1236.12s)]
*  is a really, really, really good entrepreneur. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1238.8799999999999s)]
*  And I'm a really big fan of his. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1242.76s)]
*  That said, I just don't think [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1246.2399999999998s)]
*  that there's a lot of political support [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1249.28s)]
*  to visit this issue right now. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1253.08s)]
*  And so unfortunately, I'm pretty skeptical [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1256.1599999999999s)]
*  that you're going to see any form of legislation pass. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1259.56s)]
*  I unfortunately think that [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1264.6s)]
*  the SEC has by and large put the entire sector into mate. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1269.12s)]
*  And so I think that what Jason said [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1273.32s)]
*  is largely right, which is that it's going to force [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1279.0s)]
*  these companies to preserve enterprise value, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1281.4799999999998s)]
*  to leave the United States, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1284.08s)]
*  and to jurisdictionally operate from a different place, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1286.28s)]
*  and to basically IP block and IP gate US residents [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1289.6799999999998s)]
*  from using their products and services. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1294.8799999999999s)]
*  I also think that they're going to have to pay large fines. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1297.68s)]
*  And so the only thing that'll be left is to adjudicate [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1300.72s)]
*  all of the staking stuff that happened [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1304.88s)]
*  and whether that was right or wrong. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1306.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1308.52s)]
*  So the court, it'll get settled, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1309.3600000000001s)]
*  it'll get decided in the courts. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1310.32s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1311.16s)]
*  And I think that when you start talking about minutiae, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1312.0s)]
*  like, well, these 16 cryptos are okay or not okay. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1315.32s)]
*  Like you're kind of missing the point. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1319.68s)]
*  The government led by Gensler [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1321.2s)]
*  is in a full assault on crypto. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1322.96s)]
*  And the goal is basically to either destroy it in the US [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1326.0s)]
*  or drive it offshore. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1328.56s)]
*  Chamath is right about that. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1329.6000000000001s)]
*  And the question is why. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1331.16s)]
*  And I think, Jay Cal, you made the point [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1332.56s)]
*  that progressives like Elizabeth Warren [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1334.92s)]
*  see crypto as competition to fiat currency. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1336.88s)]
*  And they do not want there to be a competitor. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1341.28s)]
*  Now, what is the reason for that? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1343.28s)]
*  I think it's because of their radical spending schemes. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1345.0s)]
*  Remember, in the first years of the Biden administration, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1347.44s)]
*  the progressives wanted a $4.5 trillion [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1349.76s)]
*  build back better bill. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1352.52s)]
*  Remember, Larry Summers told them [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1353.88s)]
*  that you're gonna cause inflation. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1357.64s)]
*  And even the $750 billion scoped down version [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1359.24s)]
*  that they ultimately passed caused a lot of inflation. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1362.5600000000002s)]
*  And it caused the problems that we have now [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1364.96s)]
*  that we're seeing in the economy. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1366.44s)]
*  But they wanted 4.5 trillion. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1367.5600000000002s)]
*  And when people were opposed to it [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1369.0800000000002s)]
*  and said we couldn't fund this, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1370.24s)]
*  they were in favor of minting trillion dollar coins. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1371.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1374.5200000000002s)]
*  So these are people who don't want any check [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1375.3600000000001s)]
*  on their ability to spend down the full faith [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1378.3200000000002s)]
*  and credit of the United States. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1381.1200000000001s)]
*  They would basically spend all the money that we have. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1382.56s)]
*  They would basically eat the seed corn. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1385.56s)]
*  Or don't have. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1387.72s)]
*  That we don't have that I think you guys agree [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1388.8799999999999s)]
*  we should not be spending. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1390.8799999999999s)]
*  And that is why they're the faction in our political system [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1392.32s)]
*  who are most against crypto. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1395.56s)]
*  The two things can be true, Freberg. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1397.44s)]
*  Hold on, I gotta respond to it. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1399.0s)]
*  Two things can be true. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1400.2s)]
*  One, the government doesn't want to give up [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1401.96s)]
*  control of fiat, I agree with that. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1403.9199999999998s)]
*  The second thing that's also true [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1405.84s)]
*  is that this group of people [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1407.28s)]
*  did not wanna play by the rules. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1408.32s)]
*  They knew the rules. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1409.9199999999998s)]
*  They explicitly broke them for profit. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1410.84s)]
*  That's why they have them dead to rights. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1412.68s)]
*  You can name this operation choke point. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1414.92s)]
*  You can brand it. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1417.4s)]
*  You can put out any conspiracy theory you want. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1418.24s)]
*  They did have the option to file for these. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1420.36s)]
*  Why is it a conspiracy theory? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1421.8799999999999s)]
*  You agree they're trying to run these guys out of business. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1423.08s)]
*  I agree. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1424.8799999999999s)]
*  I said two things can be true at the same time, David. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1425.72s)]
*  This is a tolerance for ambiguity. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1427.64s)]
*  Being able to hold two thoughts at the same time. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1429.24s)]
*  They broke the rules [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1431.44s)]
*  and they don't wanna give up control of fiat. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1432.76s)]
*  That's what's happening. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1434.72s)]
*  That's the rule. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1435.56s)]
*  You have to file as a security. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1436.4s)]
*  You have to only allow credit investors. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1437.32s)]
*  On previous podcasts, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1438.16s)]
*  you said that Coinbase was a good actor. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1439.16s)]
*  I believe they have good intentions. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1442.0800000000002s)]
*  Yes, I don't believe the other people do. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1443.24s)]
*  I do believe Coinbase has good intentions. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1445.24s)]
*  So now you believe that Coinbase is in violation of the law. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1446.0800000000002s)]
*  I believe the securities they're trading [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1448.5600000000002s)]
*  are in violation of the law. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1450.52s)]
*  And that's obvious. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1451.8000000000002s)]
*  But I believe that law should change. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1453.3200000000002s)]
*  Let me give you a third point. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1454.5600000000002s)]
*  So the securities are securities. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1455.4s)]
*  Okay, J Cal, let me give you a third point and Sachs. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1457.0400000000002s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren, she may be motivated [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1461.3200000000002s)]
*  by the intention to preserve the authority of the fiat. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1463.92s)]
*  But is it not also possible [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1468.72s)]
*  that a large number of people lost a lot of money [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1470.68s)]
*  that they worked hard for and they used to buy crypto assets [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1473.96s)]
*  and then the value of those assets went down [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1477.96s)]
*  and those people lost a lot of value. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1479.96s)]
*  I had, there was a group of guys that are house painters [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1482.2s)]
*  that painted my house two summers ago [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1486.0800000000002s)]
*  and they painted the whole house. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1489.92s)]
*  They were here every day for hours every day. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1490.76s)]
*  So I got to speak to these guys [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1492.3600000000001s)]
*  and these guys were house painters. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1494.28s)]
*  They work for an hourly wage. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1497.68s)]
*  They do fairly well, but every lunch break, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1499.5s)]
*  every break they got, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1501.72s)]
*  all that they would talk about with one another [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1503.32s)]
*  was what cryptocurrency they're buying [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1505.52s)]
*  and trading in and out of [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1507.76s)]
*  with the whole intention of making money. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1509.28s)]
*  They all believed that they had a good point of view [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1512.12s)]
*  because they read something on the internet [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1514.84s)]
*  or got some tweet or got some text [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1516.2s)]
*  or saw something on TikTok about this one crypto asset [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1518.32s)]
*  or this crypto asset and they were trading in and out [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1521.2s)]
*  and all of the money that these guys worked hard for [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1523.36s)]
*  was being invested in crypto assets. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1527.12s)]
*  You're right, that set of facts is not great. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1528.48s)]
*  However, I don't think that's the motivation. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1530.4s)]
*  I think the motivation is to basically end crypto [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1532.2s)]
*  as a potential competitor to fiat money [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1535.68s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1538.08s)]
*  That's the motivation. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1539.2s)]
*  And they're gonna use those fact patterns [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1540.6s)]
*  to basically build public support that. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1542.8799999999999s)]
*  Because look, because we can handle that, okay? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1544.72s)]
*  We could do the accredited investor test. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1547.8s)]
*  There should be a framework or set of guidelines [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1549.6399999999999s)]
*  under which it is legal for people to buy and hold [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1551.84s)]
*  crypto in the United States. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1556.04s)]
*  And lose their money. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1557.32s)]
*  And that's all that Brian has been asking for [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1558.16s)]
*  is give us a framework. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1559.52s)]
*  And Genzer is not giving a framework. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1560.88s)]
*  He's just trying to basically put them out of business. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1562.96s)]
*  Okay, look, I think we've gone around this topic. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1565.24s)]
*  This has been a great conversation. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1567.12s)]
*  I'm gonna move forward to the next topic, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1568.48s)]
*  which I think is really interesting [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1571.12s)]
*  in the vein of both de-globalization, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1575.36s)]
*  but also the scale at which venture firms have gotten to. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1578.52s)]
*  Sequoia decided this week and announced publicly [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1582.8s)]
*  that they're splitting off their China [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1586.16s)]
*  and India slash Southeast Asia funds. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1587.68s)]
*  As you guys obviously know, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1590.5600000000002s)]
*  Sequoia Capital is a venture capital firm. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1592.48s)]
*  And within that firm, they manage multiple funds. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1595.96s)]
*  Some of the funds that they've raised and managed [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1599.68s)]
*  have been specifically targeted in China [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1601.92s)]
*  where they have $56 billion. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1604.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't know if this number is accurate, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1607.3200000000002s)]
*  but that's an incredible number. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1608.48s)]
*  $56 billion of assets under management [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1609.8400000000001s)]
*  focused just in Sequoia China. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1611.96s)]
*  And then they have a Sequoia India fund, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1613.96s)]
*  which has about $4 billion of capital raised [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1618.04s)]
*  in just the last three years. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1620.76s)]
*  And now they are separating the management company [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1623.08s)]
*  and the oversight of those funds [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1625.32s)]
*  into separate management companies. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1627.44s)]
*  So Sequoia Capital will no longer oversee those China funds. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1629.08s)]
*  A new firm has been formed called Sequoia China [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1633.6000000000001s)]
*  that is now owned and run [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1636.44s)]
*  by a separate management team based in China. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1637.8s)]
*  And Sequoia India is now called Peak 15 Partners, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1640.44s)]
*  which is owned and operated by a separate team [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1643.4s)]
*  of managers out of India. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1645.64s)]
*  Roloff Botha will manage the US and European Sequoia Capital. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1648.0s)]
*  Neil Chen will oversee Sequoia China. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1652.5600000000002s)]
*  And Shailendra Singh. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1655.68s)]
*  Neil Chen. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1656.88s)]
*  I'm sorry, Neil Chen. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1657.72s)]
*  And Shailendra Singh will oversee Sequoia India. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1658.8000000000002s)]
*  I guess this is a question of did Sequoia get too big [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1661.8000000000002s)]
*  or are they caving to pressure of the political issues [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1665.1200000000001s)]
*  arising with having deep relationships and ties with China [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1669.0400000000002s)]
*  or as they have said, a lot of competition [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1672.52s)]
*  between these different portfolios and companies [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1674.84s)]
*  within these portfolios amongst each other. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1676.92s)]
*  Chamath, what's your read on the action? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1678.96s)]
*  Is there anything to read into this [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1680.88s)]
*  and anything to extrapolate from it? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1682.64s)]
*  Well, it's been a parade of missteps for Sequoia [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1684.04s)]
*  in the last couple of years. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1687.52s)]
*  And I'll let Sequoia figure out who to blame for this. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1688.84s)]
*  But the reality is they, I think, felt a lot of FOMO, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1692.68s)]
*  post SoftBank. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1697.68s)]
*  They raised this large mega fund [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1699.08s)]
*  that kind of straddled all of the sub funds [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1702.04s)]
*  and straddled all of the regions. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1704.6s)]
*  And so they dangled the carrot of trying to get [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1706.28s)]
*  into the early stage US fund by investing [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1709.16s)]
*  in this big mega fund that also had China [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1711.64s)]
*  and India exposure and growth exposure. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1713.6s)]
*  Then they tried this like very convoluted evergreen structure [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1716.28s)]
*  right before the market fell apart, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1723.04s)]
*  where you could basically become a permanent capital vehicle. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1725.0s)]
*  As far as I can tell from the outside looking in, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1729.92s)]
*  it just seems like a tax play for the GPs [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1732.84s)]
*  to not have to sell and realize capital gains. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1736.96s)]
*  But that only works when the stock market keeps going up, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1741.4s)]
*  which it didn't, and then it's summarily crushed tech stocks, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1744.04s)]
*  80 or 90%. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1747.44s)]
*  So that was a misstep. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1748.32s)]
*  And then when you put all these things together, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1750.04s)]
*  now that China is contracting, and we've said this before, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1753.08s)]
*  I think China is largely uninvestable [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1755.44s)]
*  for the next 30 or 40 years, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1758.0s)]
*  it just makes sense to jettison it. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1761.04s)]
*  Now, I will say though that Neil Shen is elite. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1763.36s)]
*  If you consider in investing, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1766.16s)]
*  I would say I have a simple rubric. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1768.24s)]
*  Anybody who's made more than a billion dollars [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1770.36s)]
*  for themselves as an investor, I consider elite. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1772.2s)]
*  Neil Shen is elite. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1774.88s)]
*  And so he'll do just fine running [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1778.08s)]
*  that Sequoia China business. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1781.08s)]
*  I was surprised about why they would allow India to leave [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1783.88s)]
*  because there's nobody that elite at Sequoia India [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1788.92s)]
*  by that rubric, but India is a country growing [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1792.3600000000001s)]
*  at 6% a year. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1795.92s)]
*  It literally looks like China in 2008 and nine. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1796.76s)]
*  And so I'm not sure why you would let them leave. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1800.56s)]
*  I think that you would want to attach them to yourself [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1804.88s)]
*  because it makes the US business look better. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1807.48s)]
*  You probably get differentiated and smoothed out returns. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1810.28s)]
*  But I think this is a little bit of taking- [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1815.04s)]
*  of competition, Chamath, that there was competition [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1815.92s)]
*  between the different portfolio companies. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1818.16s)]
*  And it was leading to conflict. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1822.0400000000002s)]
*  That's stupid. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1822.88s)]
*  I mean, that's dumb. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1824.44s)]
*  That happens in the United States. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1825.64s)]
*  Sequoia has always been known to fund everybody [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1827.7600000000002s)]
*  that they think will make money, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1830.16s)]
*  no matter how much they compete, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1831.48s)]
*  no matter where they are. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1832.5600000000002s)]
*  It was controversial when they backed YouTube [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1833.4s)]
*  and Moritz was sitting on the board at Google. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1835.3200000000002s)]
*  Sure. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1838.24s)]
*  Look, Sequoia as an organization is elite. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1839.0800000000002s)]
*  They're there to make money for their LPs, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1841.44s)]
*  period, end of story. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1843.0s)]
*  And so all of the other words [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1844.36s)]
*  that can go in any press release, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1846.08s)]
*  basically, I think, try to hide the fact [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1848.12s)]
*  that this is an organization that's had some missteps. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1850.1599999999999s)]
*  They're not on solid ground. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1853.1999999999998s)]
*  They've lost a lot of money. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1855.04s)]
*  And they're trying to figure out what to do next. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1856.28s)]
*  I, however, if I was running that organization, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1859.6399999999999s)]
*  would have probably done nothing [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1862.6s)]
*  and just let the dust settle. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1865.6s)]
*  And I think that all of these actions are too close together [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1867.9599999999998s)]
*  and it's a little bit, to me, of flailing in the water. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1871.28s)]
*  And so I don't think it was a good idea to let India leave. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1875.56s)]
*  I think it made a ton of sense to cut China. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1880.68s)]
*  But I think all of this stuff happened, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1884.32s)]
*  started happening a few years ago, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1886.0s)]
*  starting with that eight or $9 billion dollar mega fund [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1888.16s)]
*  that they raised to try to compete with Softbank. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1890.8799999999999s)]
*  Sax, any read on this? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1893.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think it's a example, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1895.84s)]
*  prominent example of decoupling [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1897.96s)]
*  and globalization going on. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1899.64s)]
*  So I agree we have to treat India and China separately. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1901.68s)]
*  With respect to China, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1904.6000000000001s)]
*  I just think it's become harder and harder [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1905.92s)]
*  for Americans to do business in China, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1908.5600000000002s)]
*  both because we don't really have the visibility [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1911.3200000000002s)]
*  into that system and there's too much political uncertainty. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1914.96s)]
*  So kind of to Chema's point about it [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1919.68s)]
*  being increasingly uninvestable. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1921.5200000000002s)]
*  But I also think the geopolitical concerns, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1923.8000000000002s)]
*  it's just very hard to straddle those concerns now [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1925.8000000000002s)]
*  because the geopolitical competition is heating up so much. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1929.0s)]
*  I think it's investable for people like Neil Shen, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1932.32s)]
*  who are insiders in that system. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1935.32s)]
*  So I think elite Chinese investors can, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1937.52s)]
*  I'm sure, make money in China over the next few decades, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1941.04s)]
*  but I think it's just too hard for Americans [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1943.96s)]
*  to figure that out. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1946.4s)]
*  So I think them parting ways makes a lot of sense. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1947.72s)]
*  I think it's gonna simplify Sequoia's life a lot. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1951.2s)]
*  India, I agree with Chema [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1954.64s)]
*  that that's sort of a different question [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1956.4s)]
*  because India is gonna be a huge growth economy [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1957.8400000000001s)]
*  over the next few decades and they are a US ally. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1959.5600000000002s)]
*  So it doesn't pose the same geopolitical risks. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1963.2s)]
*  But my guess is that it was just kind of unwieldy, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1966.52s)]
*  that it's too unwieldy to kind of merge funding sources [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1970.44s)]
*  and firm management across two firms [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1976.6000000000001s)]
*  that are really pretty different, right? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1979.44s)]
*  The US Sequoia firm and then this Indian firm. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1980.76s)]
*  So my guess is they just decoupled [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1983.28s)]
*  because it was just getting too hard to manage. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1985.36s)]
*  And if you're an LP, don't you just want the ability to say, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1987.76s)]
*  okay, I'm gonna allocate this much money to India [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1990.4399999999998s)]
*  and I'm gonna allocate this much money to the US? [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1992.8799999999999s)]
*  I think LP is probably like it too. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1995.76s)]
*  Sequoia China is frankly, over the last 15 or 20 years, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=1997.72s)]
*  as good and probably is numerically better than Sequoia US. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2002.56s)]
*  So that was an elite organization just by itself. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2007.52s)]
*  Sequoia India, I don't think has much to talk about. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2011.0s)]
*  And so maybe what Roloff decided is [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2014.1599999999999s)]
*  this team is just not very good. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2016.84s)]
*  So we might as well just cut it and we can revisit it later. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2018.12s)]
*  They probably have some number of years of a non-compete [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2020.4399999999998s)]
*  and then they could come back into the market five years [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2023.4399999999998s)]
*  with a totally new team and that may be easier. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2025.32s)]
*  So maybe easier just to just- [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2028.04s)]
*  Maybe the team there- [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2029.32s)]
*  I can give you the actual information. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2030.1599999999999s)]
*  They wanted to be separate. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2031.0s)]
*  Look, it's hard to cross returns [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2032.0s)]
*  from two totally different funds, right? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2034.28s)]
*  Because one side's gonna be unhappy with the trade, right? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2037.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2040.4799999999998s)]
*  I can give you the- [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2041.32s)]
*  JCal's got actual information to share. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2042.32s)]
*  Well, no, I mean, I have the closest, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2044.8s)]
*  I think I have the closest- [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2046.6799999999998s)]
*  But they were an investor in your company, right, JCal? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2047.52s)]
*  Well, I'm an LP in their funds. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2049.6s)]
*  They're printing money for me. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2051.44s)]
*  They backed my second startup. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2053.0s)]
*  Roloff's on the board of that company and still with me. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2054.2799999999997s)]
*  And I was their first scout [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2056.2799999999997s)]
*  when they started the Scouts program, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2058.64s)]
*  which is the highest percentage performing fund [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2059.68s)]
*  I think they ever had. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2062.6s)]
*  Sequoia's 20- [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2063.96s)]
*  And you're our resident Captain America. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2064.7999999999997s)]
*  So as a patriot, how do you feel about the- [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2066.68s)]
*  Well, they are, put that aside. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2069.08s)]
*  Sequoia's 20% of the NASDAQ. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2070.96s)]
*  This is the greatest venture firm of all time, hands down. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2072.44s)]
*  And the Sequoia Fund, which Chamath referred to- [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2075.16s)]
*  You mean companies they've invested in. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2078.2s)]
*  Companies they've invested in are 20% of the NASDAQ, yes. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2079.8s)]
*  And so the reason the Sequoia Fund came out, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2082.4s)]
*  this Evergreen Fund, was because a lot of their LPs [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2084.52s)]
*  wanted Sequoia to manage the public equities going forward [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2087.76s)]
*  because they didn't want to sell them [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2092.84s)]
*  because they realized- [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2094.04s)]
*  Bullshit. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2095.08s)]
*  That the massive gains, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2095.92s)]
*  the gains from Google, Apple, et cetera, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2098.36s)]
*  of these investments that they did [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2102.2400000000002s)]
*  when they were private companies, Cisco, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2104.96s)]
*  the gains from public forward [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2106.4s)]
*  were greater than the gains in private. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2108.2000000000003s)]
*  And I've been in on these presentations. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2110.52s)]
*  I've sat through them with the Sequoia team. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2112.1200000000003s)]
*  And so when you manage those public ones, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2115.8s)]
*  we've all talked about the denominator problem here. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2119.2000000000003s)]
*  The denominator problem is, hey, are they venture returns [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2121.6400000000003s)]
*  or are they part of the public equities? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2124.1200000000003s)]
*  So at a giant endowment, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2125.36s)]
*  they want to put them into the equities bucket, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2126.8s)]
*  get them out of the venture bucket. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2128.28s)]
*  And Sequoia saw an opportunity there [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2129.7200000000003s)]
*  to manage this Evergreen Fund. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2131.44s)]
*  I'm sure there are tax advantages to it, of course. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2133.5600000000004s)]
*  But with relation to what they did in China and India, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2136.2000000000003s)]
*  these were incredibly prescient [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2138.8s)]
*  and innovative things they did in 2000 and 2005 [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2143.1600000000003s)]
*  when they started in India and then China was 2005, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2148.36s)]
*  I believe. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2151.0s)]
*  They found domestic teams. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2151.92s)]
*  You need domestic teams to do this properly, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2153.5600000000004s)]
*  especially in places with different governance [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2155.76s)]
*  and different regulations. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2157.96s)]
*  And it gives them autonomy. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2159.64s)]
*  They were incredible investments. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2161.52s)]
*  But what's happening right now is all venture investments [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2163.68s)]
*  because of AI and chips and the decoupling with China [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2167.36s)]
*  are now under massive scrutiny. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2170.32s)]
*  So they can say there's brand confusion. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2172.7200000000003s)]
*  You can talk about the collisions [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2174.96s)]
*  and who's gonna back this Chinese entrepreneur [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2177.92s)]
*  or an Indian entrepreneur [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2180.12s)]
*  who also is operating in the US, right? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2181.12s)]
*  These businesses operate in the US. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2183.08s)]
*  And so what really is happening [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2185.48s)]
*  is the government is gonna stop [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2188.12s)]
*  all US venture investing in China. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2189.92s)]
*  That's what's gonna happen in the coming months. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2192.28s)]
*  And so they're just getting ahead of that. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2194.68s)]
*  And now they will compete. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2196.08s)]
*  And it really has to do with chips and AI. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2198.84s)]
*  You may have seen some of these stories [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2201.84s)]
*  and nobody's gonna invest. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2203.0s)]
*  If an American invests in AI in China, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2204.4s)]
*  that's gonna be banned and the same with chips. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2207.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2209.4s)]
*  There are a bunch of stories about whether US investors [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2210.2400000000002s)]
*  should be investing in AI in China. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2212.7200000000003s)]
*  And people were saying this was un-American [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2215.12s)]
*  because it was basically gonna give China an advantage [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2217.4s)]
*  against us in this key industry. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2220.64s)]
*  And I think that point is a good example [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2222.52s)]
*  of what I'm talking about with the geopolitical concerns. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2224.68s)]
*  It's just getting too complicated [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2226.64s)]
*  for Americans to invest in China. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2228.7999999999997s)]
*  It raises too many geopolitical concerns. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2230.52s)]
*  And I think Sequoia is massively simplifying its life [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2232.6s)]
*  by just splitting these things up and being out. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2236.0s)]
*  Did you see Keith Verboy's tweets on this? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2238.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's what we're referring to. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2240.04s)]
*  Yeah, Keith Verboy tweeted basically like, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2241.3199999999997s)]
*  it's un-American to invest in China at this point. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2243.44s)]
*  Yeah, we've talked about this before. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2246.56s)]
*  I mean, look, the Chinese relationship [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2247.56s)]
*  primarily used to be seen as an economic relationship [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2249.36s)]
*  and people were looking for win-win, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2252.6800000000003s)]
*  basically trade scenarios. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2254.6800000000003s)]
*  And it was not seen as a moral to invest in China. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2256.0s)]
*  Now the relationship is primarily seen [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2259.7200000000003s)]
*  through a geopolitical lens, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2261.36s)]
*  which is to say the balance of power, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2262.84s)]
*  which is a zero sum game. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2264.56s)]
*  It's about how much better is the US doing? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2266.08s)]
*  How much more powerful is it than China? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2268.56s)]
*  And anybody who's perceived as helping China [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2270.32s)]
*  in that rubric now is looked on skeptically [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2273.08s)]
*  within the United States. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2275.8s)]
*  What do you think, Zach, about that? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2276.64s)]
*  Well, like I said, I don't think that's gonna change. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2279.32s)]
*  So I think Sequoia is doing the right thing to kind of, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2281.88s)]
*  like I said, simplify its life. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2283.64s)]
*  What's your personal opinion? [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2284.8s)]
*  I'm curious. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2286.0s)]
*  I think that it should be possible to do business [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2287.2799999999997s)]
*  with China without it being seen [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2291.2s)]
*  as either unpatriotic or immoral. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2292.88s)]
*  However, there are strategic technologies [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2295.36s)]
*  that are just gonna be, I think, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2298.84s)]
*  it's too hard and too risky to be supporting China. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2301.16s)]
*  Chips and AI? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2305.56s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, if somebody is using [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2307.08s)]
*  Chinese manufacturing to make toys or clothes, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2309.44s)]
*  I don't think that's fundamentally strategic [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2312.44s)]
*  in a geopolitical way. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2315.04s)]
*  But if you're helping them make the next generation of chips, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2316.8399999999997s)]
*  that's gonna raise a lot of questions. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2322.2799999999997s)]
*  So a VC firm, Freiburg, can't take out chips and AI [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2324.64s)]
*  from their investment pieces? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2328.7999999999997s)]
*  Hold on, I wanna say something. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2329.92s)]
*  Cause this reminds me of when Benchmark [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2331.08s)]
*  actually had Benchmark Europe and then they cut it. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2333.56s)]
*  Do you guys remember that? [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2336.16s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2337.16s)]
*  And kind of retrench. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2338.16s)]
*  They weren't retrenching from a position of strength. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2339.2s)]
*  They were retrenching to reestablish themselves [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2341.12s)]
*  after a bunch of missteps. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2343.7999999999997s)]
*  So I think typically these retrenchments happen [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2345.0s)]
*  when there's a little bit of internal chaos [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2347.68s)]
*  and mismanagement and underperformance. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2349.44s)]
*  That's not the case here, I can assure you. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2352.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, but I actually think retrenching is good [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2354.48s)]
*  because it simplifies things. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2356.2s)]
*  I'm a big fan of it. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2358.4s)]
*  You wanna simplify yours. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2359.2400000000002s)]
*  I totally agree with you. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2360.08s)]
*  My point is when I saw that overlay fund, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2361.08s)]
*  I was like, this is questionable. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2364.48s)]
*  But then when I saw that weird evergreen fund, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2366.32s)]
*  that to me just seemed like a tax arb. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2369.44s)]
*  And I thought to myself, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2371.88s)]
*  as a person who's looked at this exact stuff [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2373.44s)]
*  for my own stuff, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2375.48s)]
*  what I did was I just converted it to a family office. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2377.32s)]
*  And from a tax perspective, it was much simpler. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2380.6400000000003s)]
*  But that exact same structure I looked at for myself. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2383.6s)]
*  And the reason that that structure exists, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2386.72s)]
*  and Jason, I know you wanna think [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2389.04s)]
*  it's because these endowments [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2391.08s)]
*  want them to manage public equities. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2392.24s)]
*  I still work with a few endowments and pension systems. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2393.68s)]
*  They don't. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2396.7999999999997s)]
*  And the reason they don't is they're not allowed to. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2397.64s)]
*  They're not allowed for concentration purposes. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2399.16s)]
*  They pay other people to manage it. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2401.3599999999997s)]
*  They have these outside consultants. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2403.16s)]
*  And for fiduciary perspective, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2404.9199999999996s)]
*  you have to do all of these things [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2406.3999999999996s)]
*  with respect to managing risk. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2407.7599999999998s)]
*  And one of the most obvious things [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2409.3199999999997s)]
*  that these foundations do is [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2410.6s)]
*  they get distributions and they sell. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2412.16s)]
*  They don't hold. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2414.16s)]
*  And so the reason why you'd wanna look at [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2415.24s)]
*  the long-term gains of a stock that you distributed [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2417.2799999999997s)]
*  is because the GP sold too early, not the LP. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2420.8799999999997s)]
*  And I just don't, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2425.08s)]
*  I think that you should not just be a blind surrogate [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2425.9599999999996s)]
*  on this topic and actually really think about it. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2428.4799999999996s)]
*  Well, I mean, I don't think you need to, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2430.52s)]
*  well, I'm not, and Square, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2432.3199999999997s)]
*  if you look at something like that, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2435.16s)]
*  Ruloff's still on the board of Square, I believe. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2437.16s)]
*  So they, Sequoia has realized over time, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2439.2s)]
*  as it's been explained to me as an LP, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2442.4399999999996s)]
*  that these companies grow, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2445.2s)]
*  the outliers continue to grow massively [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2447.16s)]
*  when they become public. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2449.64s)]
*  And Sequoia is now staying on the board of those companies. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2450.96s)]
*  And so they actually have the most insight into it [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2453.4s)]
*  because they backed it when it was two people [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2455.24s)]
*  and then they're still on the board when it's public. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2457.2s)]
*  Money is not infinite. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2459.2s)]
*  And if you're a foundation and you're legally obligated [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2460.3599999999997s)]
*  to distribute some percentage every year, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2463.0s)]
*  you need the money back. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2464.96s)]
*  And the foundations do get to choose. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2466.08s)]

*  Harvard or whoever, I'm just picking one of the large ones. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2469.48s)]
*  If somebody's got 30, $40 billion, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2472.64s)]
*  they may not need to liquidate that. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2475.32s)]
*  And they might very much wanna hold for the long term. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2476.16s)]
*  I'm just telling you, the only person that is in a position [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2478.12s)]
*  to actually hold for the long term, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2479.96s)]
*  because it's so tax advantageous, is the GP. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2481.2400000000002s)]
*  That is why that fund was created. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2484.44s)]
*  And I will bet you, if you ask him under oath [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2485.88s)]
*  why they did it, I'll tell you it was for themselves. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2490.0s)]
*  I will bet you. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2494.08s)]
*  Bet you. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2494.92s)]
*  I'll bet you a million dollars for charity. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2495.76s)]
*  Whatever you wanna do, I bet you. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2497.36s)]
*  If you put him under oath and you subpoena him [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2498.64s)]
*  and you ask him why he did it, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2500.4s)]
*  he'll say he did it for himself. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2501.72s)]
*  And that's fine. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2503.0s)]
*  That's the kind of complexity that Sachs is talking about [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2505.2s)]
*  that does not add to success. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2507.6s)]
*  It is overcomplexifying something [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2509.6s)]
*  that doesn't need to be complicated. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2511.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I disagree with you, but we can just move on. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2513.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, we agree to disagree sometimes [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2515.6s)]
*  here on the All In Podcast. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2517.3999999999996s)]
*  We're gonna move on for our last topic of the day [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2518.64s)]
*  with the announcement. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2521.24s)]
*  Can we talk messy? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2523.08s)]
*  No, no, no, we're not, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2524.6s)]
*  because we're gonna do one last topic, which I think is- [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2525.6s)]
*  PGA and messy go together. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2527.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, so let's just talk about the PGA. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2528.7599999999998s)]
*  Let's do messy and the PGA. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2529.6s)]
*  No, we don't have time. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2531.16s)]
*  Guys, I appreciate the messy interest, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2532.16s)]
*  but we're gonna talk about something less messy [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2534.84s)]
*  or even more messy. Who cares about the PGA? [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2535.68s)]
*  Who cares about the PGA? [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2537.12s)]
*  I actually think it's pretty interesting [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2537.96s)]
*  for a couple of reasons. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2539.16s)]
*  So as you guys know, the PGA tour has been around since 1930. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2540.4s)]
*  I think the PGA tour makes $1.6 billion a year [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2544.92s)]
*  if reports are correct. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2548.56s)]
*  I make 1.6 billion a year. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2550.04s)]
*  Boring. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2551.8s)]
*  I mean, it depends on the year. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2552.7599999999998s)]
*  All of the players on the PGA tour [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2554.6s)]
*  are independent contractors. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2557.24s)]
*  So Saudi Arabia's public investment fund, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2558.96s)]
*  and this is what I think is one of the more interesting [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2562.5s)]
*  aspects of this story, and maybe speaks to a broader [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2564.46s)]
*  kind of set of geopolitical transitions that are underway. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2568.74s)]
*  The Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2574.62s)]
*  started LIV Golf as an alternative to the PGA tour. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2577.9s)]
*  Live Golf. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2581.42s)]
*  Live Golf, they invested $2 billion of capital [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2582.62s)]
*  and offered guarantees to golfers [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2586.46s)]
*  to come and get on their tour. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2590.1s)]
*  They ended up offering, at one point, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2591.7799999999997s)]
*  Tiger Woods reportedly got a $800 million guarantee [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2593.9799999999996s)]
*  to join their tour, which he turned down. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2597.64s)]
*  Phil Mickelson got a reported $200 million guarantee, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2600.4199999999996s)]
*  which he took to join the tour. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2603.3799999999997s)]
*  Hideki Matsuyama got offered 750 million, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2605.4199999999996s)]
*  which he turned down. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2609.1s)]
*  So seven of the 10 top paid golfers in the world [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2610.2599999999998s)]
*  actually signed up. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2613.06s)]
*  And it caused obviously significant disruption [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2615.2599999999998s)]
*  to what has effectively been a monopoly, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2618.5s)]
*  which is the PGA tour in golf, in professional golf. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2620.26s)]
*  And here we are two years later, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2624.26s)]
*  and it was announced this week, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2627.46s)]
*  that LIV and PGA are merging. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2629.1800000000003s)]
*  And the current PGA Tour commissioner, Jay Moynihan, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2631.8s)]
*  will serve as CEO of the new entity. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2634.36s)]
*  Just by way of reference, Jay Moynihan makes a reported [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2637.0600000000004s)]
*  $14 to $15 million a year in salary as CEO of the PGA tour. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2639.9s)]
*  He will now be CEO of this combined organization. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2644.1800000000003s)]
*  One big question mark is how much is he getting paid, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2647.34s)]
*  and did that help secure and solidify [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2649.9s)]
*  this deal getting done? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2652.6600000000003s)]
*  But I think another big question is, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2654.58s)]
*  do we think this will actually close? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2655.98s)]
*  Will this face regulatory and antitrust scrutiny? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2657.46s)]
*  Will this face CFIUS? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2660.0s)]
*  Because it is the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2661.42s)]
*  that is effectively taking a large stake in the PGA tour. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2664.1800000000003s)]
*  Let's go to our resident professional sports team owner [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2668.32s)]
*  or former minority owner, Chamath. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2671.7400000000002s)]
*  Any takes on this announced merger? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2675.42s)]
*  What does it say about the PGA's ability to hold action? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2678.42s)]
*  This is what's so crazy about your topic selection. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2681.26s)]
*  Messi was offered $1.6 billion personally by the Saudis, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2685.2200000000003s)]
*  and you don't wanna talk about that [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2689.34s)]
*  because you wanna talk about a whole organization [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2690.54s)]
*  playing an antiquated sport that itself generates [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2692.34s)]
*  $1.6 billion. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2695.7400000000002s)]
*  Welcome to being the moderator. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2697.1s)]
*  Tech moderator. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2700.5s)]
*  I'm sorry, so what's your point? [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2701.34s)]
*  Welcome to my world. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2703.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't care about golf, I don't care. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2704.1800000000003s)]
*  The reason this is so controversial [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2706.1800000000003s)]
*  is that they're calling it sports washing, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2709.34s)]
*  trying to make the reputation of Saudi more palatable [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2712.1400000000003s)]
*  in the West by using sports, things people love. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2714.9s)]
*  The reason this has become controversial [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2718.98s)]
*  is because of the hypocrisy of it. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2720.7400000000002s)]
*  The PGA fought against Liv, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2722.3s)]
*  and this guy, Jay Monahan, who is the CEO of this, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2725.42s)]
*  he basically evoked the 9-11 families [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2730.2200000000003s)]
*  and went on a whole thing about how evil Liv was [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2734.08s)]
*  only to then secure the bag. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2737.46s)]
*  And then there's some backchannel here about, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2739.66s)]
*  well, there was a lawsuit between the Liv golfers [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2743.42s)]
*  who are now banned from playing in the PGA [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2746.46s)]
*  when they signed up, and antitrust stuff. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2748.42s)]
*  And so the hypocrisy of the group [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2750.92s)]
*  is what's being pulled into question here. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2754.26s)]
*  Chamod, this is why it's important. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2756.58s)]
*  Well, they ostracized. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2757.78s)]
*  The players who took the money were ostracized. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2758.98s)]
*  As supporting an evil regime. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2762.34s)]
*  And they said, oh, look at who these guys are. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2764.14s)]
*  Now it's clear that they were smart, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2766.78s)]
*  and Tiger should have taken the money. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2768.38s)]
*  And actually, the guy who said as much at the time was Trump. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2770.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, he nailed it. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2777.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like one of these idiot savant tweets. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2778.0600000000004s)]
*  Once again, he splits the arrow. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2780.1800000000003s)]
*  He basically said that take the money from Liv, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2783.1400000000003s)]
*  because eventually Liv and PGA are gonna merge, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2785.1800000000003s)]
*  and then the guys who stuck with PGA are gonna get nothing. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2787.0600000000004s)]
*  And they're gonna feel like idiots. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2789.5400000000004s)]
*  He was totally right. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2791.1000000000004s)]
*  He split the arrow again. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2792.7000000000003s)]
*  Chamod, Chamod, you don't think that that's insane? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2793.5400000000004s)]
*  I mean, come on, it's pretty amazing. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2796.26s)]
*  Tell me when you get to Messi. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2797.94s)]
*  And the fact that these guys were proclaiming [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2799.6200000000003s)]
*  that if you're gonna go join this tour, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2801.94s)]
*  you're joining, you're lining up with the evil regime. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2803.38s)]
*  I don't understand whether you're naive or dumb. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2806.9s)]
*  This is like about money. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2808.86s)]
*  It's always about money. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2810.0600000000004s)]
*  Professional sports has always been about money. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2811.0600000000004s)]
*  What are we talking about? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2813.5800000000004s)]
*  Money, money, money, money, money, there's your answer. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2816.3s)]
*  Money drove the answer. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2818.34s)]
*  Money drove the split. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2819.5s)]
*  Money drove the deals. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2820.82s)]
*  Now money drove the merger. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2821.86s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2823.38s)]
*  Can we talk about Messi, please? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2824.38s)]
*  It's so much more interesting. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2825.54s)]
*  Okay, go talk about Messi, Chamod. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2826.58s)]
*  I mean, the Messi thing is so incredible [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2829.02s)]
*  because Cristiano Ronaldo went to a team in Saudi [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2831.7s)]
*  to play in the August of his career, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2835.74s)]
*  the last two or three years. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2837.38s)]
*  And this has been a thing that started with Pele in the 70s. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2839.2599999999998s)]
*  Pele came to the New York Cosmos and played. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2842.42s)]
*  Beckham famously did it as well, came to the LA Galaxy. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2845.66s)]
*  But Beckham did this one interesting thing, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2849.2599999999998s)]
*  which is he said, okay, I'm gonna come to play in the MLS [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2851.34s)]
*  on one condition really, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2855.22s)]
*  which is I'll take a huge pay cut and all of this stuff, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2856.66s)]
*  but I want an option to buy an expansion team [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2858.66s)]
*  for 25 million bucks. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2861.3799999999997s)]
*  Fast forward, he ended up buying Inter Miami. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2863.8599999999997s)]
*  That team is now worth $585 million. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2867.1s)]
*  So Messi is 36 years old. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2871.14s)]
*  He's about to enter the August of his career. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2872.8599999999997s)]
*  He's won everything. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2874.7799999999997s)]
*  He's done everything possible. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2875.8199999999997s)]
*  He is so incredible. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2877.06s)]
*  I mean, I love him. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2878.3799999999997s)]
*  I love him. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2880.18s)]
*  He gets offered $400 million a year [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2881.98s)]
*  for four years to go play in Saudi Arabia, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2884.58s)]
*  a $1.6 billion deal. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2886.54s)]
*  And there's no income tax there. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2889.3s)]
*  So that's like $1.6 billion right in his pocket. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2891.54s)]
*  Except the deal that he did, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2895.9s)]
*  which was for a lot less upfront, is really interesting. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2898.38s)]
*  He basically said, I'll come to the United States [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2903.06s)]
*  and play in Inter Miami for the Miami football club. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2905.58s)]
*  But I am, you know, basically, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2910.9s)]
*  I'm not sure he said this, so I'm using my own words. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2914.3s)]
*  I'm the greatest player in the world. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2916.14s)]
*  Every time I do something magical on the field, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2918.58s)]
*  I'm creating content that will sell tickets [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2920.6600000000003s)]
*  and create brand awareness [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2923.1800000000003s)]
*  and move the interest level of soccer in the United States. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2924.94s)]
*  I'm a content creator. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2928.62s)]
*  So I want a piece of this content. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2930.14s)]
*  And so Apple, who signed a $2.5 billion [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2932.62s)]
*  10-year license for the MLS said, you're right. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2936.42s)]
*  You're probably gonna sell more subscriptions for me. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2939.34s)]
*  I'll give you a piece of the rev share. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2941.46s)]
*  And then Adidas said, you know what, you're right. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2944.1400000000003s)]
*  You're probably gonna sell more shoes for me. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2946.86s)]
*  I'll give you a piece of those shoes. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2948.7000000000003s)]
*  So in one fell swoop, I think what's amazing is, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2950.94s)]
*  Messi is not an athlete in this deal. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2954.6200000000003s)]
*  I think going back to a theme [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2957.1800000000003s)]
*  that we've talked about a lot is, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2958.6200000000003s)]
*  he is this ultimate penultimate, whatever. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2960.7000000000003s)]
*  He's an elite content creator. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2964.1400000000003s)]
*  He's the equity. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2966.34s)]
*  Who is now creating incredible, [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2967.5s)]
*  who will come to the United States [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2970.18s)]
*  to create this incredible content [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2971.62s)]
*  that will move viewership, move merchandise. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2973.26s)]
*  And he's gonna monetize that. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2977.14s)]
*  So it's effectively like becoming the Jordan brand, [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2979.22s)]
*  getting a piece of Netflix all in one. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2982.18s)]
*  He has the equity in those businesses, basically. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2984.3s)]
*  Yeah, this is a subtle point Shemant's making. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2986.3s)]
*  In the deal, you have the person [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2988.18s)]
*  who's responsible for distribution. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2990.9s)]
*  So this would be the same as like the NBA on ABC, ESPN, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2992.42s)]
*  or TNT. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2995.62s)]
*  And TNT or ESPN saying, you know what? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2996.66s)]
*  You're so important, LeBron James to play in this, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=2998.98s)]
*  or Steph Curry. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3001.5s)]
*  We're gonna give you a piece of the subscriptions to ESPN. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3002.7s)]
*  So Apple is giving him rev share [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3006.58s)]
*  on their Apple TV league pass for MLS. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3009.3799999999997s)]
*  That's nuts. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3013.02s)]
*  And this is, I think it goes back to the live deal with PGA, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3014.74s)]
*  which is people are looking at these sports leagues [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3018.7s)]
*  and saying, let's get creative. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3020.46s)]
*  It goes back to a different one. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3022.2999999999997s)]
*  The NBA just signed a new collective bargaining agreement [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3024.02s)]
*  that they're gonna ratify. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3026.82s)]
*  I always thought that the real thing [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3028.38s)]
*  that the NBA Players Association should be asking for [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3030.78s)]
*  was equity. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3033.82s)]
*  And that equity could be phantom equity in the teams [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3035.98s)]
*  because it's clear that in the absence of the players, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3038.7s)]
*  there's no viewership and there's no appreciation [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3041.9s)]
*  in the value of those franchises. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3044.5s)]
*  And so the idea that LeBron, Steph, Dre, KD [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3046.78s)]
*  don't own a huge piece of the underlying equity gains [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3052.5400000000004s)]
*  that they're creating in the period in which they're players [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3056.1400000000003s)]
*  is pretty crazy. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3059.02s)]
*  Now, the ownership, their perspective is, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3059.86s)]
*  well, we translate that in terms of rev share, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3062.46s)]
*  but it's really not true. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3065.5s)]
*  Because if you look at the CAGR, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3066.86s)]
*  the IRR of the franchise values [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3069.34s)]
*  versus the CAGRing of the salaries, they're not equivalent. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3071.26s)]
*  So I just think it has huge implications [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3074.86s)]
*  to all the professional sports leagues [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3078.34s)]
*  because these big stars should be asking their agents [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3080.1s)]
*  and their managers, how do I do a deal like Messi? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3083.54s)]
*  I am the ultimate content creator in my league. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3085.94s)]
*  The dynamics are changing. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3088.74s)]
*  It will no longer be an employee capital labor situation, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3090.18s)]
*  but capital is merging with labor. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3094.46s)]
*  Bravo. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3097.02s)]
*  And labor is basically becoming the equity in the equation [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3097.86s)]
*  and they are getting a piece of the business. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3101.54s)]
*  Just like Silicon Valley. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3102.7799999999997s)]
*  And by the way, the reason we see it happening so much [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3104.58s)]
*  is because of the social media age [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3106.98s)]
*  and it's really incredible. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3108.46s)]
*  But listen guys, I know you have more to say. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3110.46s)]
*  We all have more to say. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3113.1000000000004s)]
*  I just want to highlight, I need to go. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3114.02s)]
*  I have to go to a kindergarten graduation. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3116.02s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3118.02s)]
*  Congrats. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3119.38s)]
*  I'll close the Shafi'a. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3120.2200000000003s)]
*  I love you guys. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3121.04s)]
*  I'll see you later. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3121.88s)]
*  Love you. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3122.7200000000003s)]
*  Love you. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3123.56s)]
*  Love you. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3124.38s)]
*  Love you. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3125.2200000000003s)]
*  Love you. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3126.06s)]
*  Congrats to your kid. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3126.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3127.7200000000003s)]
*  Bye. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3128.56s)]
*  But what's really interesting, Chamath, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3129.38s)]
*  to your point about the CBA, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3130.2200000000003s)]
*  is they're gonna make these huge salaries. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3131.06s)]
*  They're not gonna give them the equity [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3132.9s)]
*  as part of their five-year deal. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3133.7400000000002s)]
*  They make the money. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3137.1400000000003s)]
*  They then have the ability to invest in a team. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3138.58s)]
*  So you could be LeBron and you could be investing [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3140.18s)]
*  in the Knicks maybe, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3142.5s)]
*  if somebody wanted to sell a percentage of it. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3143.62s)]
*  You can invest in any NBA team, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3145.68s)]
*  any sports betting team, any sports betting. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3147.94s)]
*  I actually think there's a simpler way to do this, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3150.7799999999997s)]
*  which is, I think it's fair to say that [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3152.62s)]
*  when you join a team, it's like joining a company, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3154.66s)]
*  and you can create shadow equity. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3157.38s)]
*  And that shadow equity says, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3159.46s)]
*  you came in at this point, right? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3160.7799999999997s)]
*  You left at this point. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3163.54s)]
*  Here was the delta of the value. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3164.86s)]
*  I think a good agent should be negotiating [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3167.4s)]
*  on behalf of a player. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3169.36s)]
*  Most players will not get that much, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3170.56s)]
*  a few basis points of that value. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3172.34s)]
*  But the idea that a LeBron James can go to a Miami [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3174.98s)]
*  and double the franchise value, double. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3177.52s)]
*  From one to- [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3180.88s)]
*  Or Steph. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3181.96s)]
*  Or Steph. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3183.44s)]
*  Steph's a better, okay, great. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3184.28s)]
*  Steph comes in at 480 million and is now 5.3 billion. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3185.6s)]
*  So that's a 10Xing plus of value. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3189.2000000000003s)]
*  Is Steph responsible for 10 or 15%? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3192.04s)]
*  Should a billion dollars of that go to Steph, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3194.64s)]
*  Dre, and Clay? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3197.04s)]
*  I think you can make a great claim that it could. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3198.08s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3200.24s)]
*  They put them on the map, so yeah. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3201.2s)]
*  It would be, and it would be pretty easy to do. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3203.04s)]
*  And what this might do is keep people [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3205.24s)]
*  on the same team longer, which is what fans want. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3207.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3209.44s)]
*  They don't want people moving around. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3210.2799999999997s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3211.2s)]
*  And private companies like Cargill or Coke Industries, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3212.2s)]
*  they have these shadow equity programs [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3215.8799999999997s)]
*  that they've had for years, [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3217.72s)]
*  for decades that they've run on behalf of their employees. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3219.08s)]
*  So we know how to run [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3221.28s)]
*  phantom equity programs in private businesses. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3225.4s)]
*  And I just think the leadership [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3228.92s)]
*  of the NBA Players Association, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3230.7200000000003s)]
*  the NFL Players Association, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3232.6400000000003s)]
*  is right now still lacking the sophistication [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3235.0s)]
*  to understand this well enough to then propose [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3238.36s)]
*  when the next time it is to negotiate this kind of a deal. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3241.6800000000003s)]
*  But when you see things like this messy deal, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3245.2000000000003s)]
*  I think it's a game changer. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3248.84s)]
*  It is a game changer. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3250.4s)]
*  And I think for sports, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3251.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know if you saw Adam Silver [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3253.52s)]
*  gave a little press conference with the finals [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3256.0s)]
*  and everything, and he was talking about [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3258.84s)]
*  the Jay Moran situation with the guns, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3259.6800000000003s)]
*  and just a lot of topics coming up. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3261.76s)]
*  But one of the topics that was probably underappreciated [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3263.6800000000003s)]
*  was he was talking about the bundle, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3266.4s)]
*  the cable bundles going away, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3268.48s)]
*  and that people can't watch the NBA on TNT, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3270.52s)]
*  whatever that is with Charles Barkley, et cetera. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3274.4s)]
*  And he wants that to be available for free. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3277.1600000000003s)]
*  So he's gonna challenge people in the new TV deal. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3281.04s)]
*  If you wanna have the NBA, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3282.48s)]
*  you have to have it available to everybody [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3283.8399999999997s)]
*  because the number of people who can see NBA games [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3285.7599999999998s)]
*  has been going down. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3288.16s)]
*  I have a question for you. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3289.3599999999997s)]
*  Do you think more people would pay [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3290.68s)]
*  for a subscription to watch the Knicks games [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3293.96s)]
*  wherever they happen to be all over the world [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3296.7999999999997s)]
*  or a subscription to watch Steph Curry [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3298.3199999999997s)]
*  no matter what team he plays on? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3300.16s)]
*  The old generations are loyal to the teams. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3301.8799999999997s)]
*  The new generation is loyal to players. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3303.7599999999998s)]
*  So it's a generational move. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3305.16s)]
*  Numerical question. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3306.4399999999996s)]
*  Which one's great? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3307.3199999999997s)]
*  It's probably a jump ball right now, [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3308.16s)]
*  but it will eventually be the fall of the players [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3310.7599999999998s)]
*  because this new generation follows players. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3313.48s)]
*  Like our kids like to follow LeBron from team to team. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3314.96s)]
*  I think you could probably sell [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3318.52s)]
*  a few hundred thousand subscriptions to the Knicks [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3320.2s)]
*  and I think you'd sell mid-millions for Steph. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3322.16s)]
*  What's gonna happen now is I think they're going to, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3325.7999999999997s)]
*  they just want this to be ad-based [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3328.0s)]
*  and to directly subscribe. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3330.3999999999996s)]
*  So I directly subscribe to the NBA. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3331.8399999999997s)]
*  I get every game for $200 a year with no ads. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3333.24s)]
*  I love it. You know what we should do? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3335.44s)]
*  I actually have a great idea. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3336.72s)]
*  What Liv did to the PGA, we should do to the NBA. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3338.84s)]
*  Let's get together $20 billion. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3342.48s)]
*  Let's start a competitive NBA league [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3345.28s)]
*  where we give the players, no I'm serious, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3347.56s)]
*  a structured phantom equity plan. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3350.0s)]
*  Pay these guys a hundred million bucks a year. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3353.04s)]
*  Get all the big guys to come. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3355.08s)]
*  Everybody else will come. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3356.28s)]
*  And just blow the whole thing wide open. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3358.32s)]
*  By the way, that's the blueprint now. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3359.6s)]
*  If you want to really compete with the NFL [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3361.0s)]
*  or the NBA or the NHL, this is what you should do. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3363.72s)]
*  Put together 20 or 30 billion, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3365.48s)]
*  which is not that much money and go for it. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3367.04s)]
*  You only need to get a couple of stars to blow it up. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3370.12s)]
*  And if you give stars to equity in the league, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3373.04s)]
*  they'll convince all the other players to come. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3374.72s)]
*  Let's give Saks some red meat here. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3376.8s)]
*  Saks will give you a little red meat. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3378.36s)]
*  You want Tucker on Twitter. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3379.8s)]
*  Here's your red meat choices as we wrap. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3381.32s)]
*  You want Tucker on Twitter. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3383.36s)]
*  You want a Russian controlled dam being destroyed [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3385.4s)]
*  for a major flood. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3390.12s)]
*  Or do you want Chris Christie joining the race? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3391.68s)]
*  Which red meat would you like? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3395.04s)]
*  Which red meat we put in front of crazy hair? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3397.88s)]
*  Well, I mean, what's happening in Ukraine [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3399.84s)]
*  is really the big news this week. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3401.16s)]
*  I mean, the Ukrainian counteroffensive has started [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3402.88s)]
*  in earnest. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3406.8s)]
*  And yes, in conjunction with that, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3408.36s)]
*  you had the destruction of that major dam, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3409.92s)]
*  which it's not clear who did it. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3412.68s)]
*  I mean, both sides are pointing the finger at each other. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3414.52s)]
*  So, and there are reasonable arguments [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3417.12s)]
*  for why either side may have done it. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3420.2s)]
*  In terms of who benefits, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3421.8s)]
*  it seems to benefit the Ukrainians more [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3423.12s)]
*  because the destruction of the dam [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3426.16s)]
*  washed out a bunch of Russian defensive fortifications [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3428.48s)]
*  and villages of Russian speakers. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3432.16s)]
*  On the other hand, the Russians were in control of the dam, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3435.8399999999997s)]
*  so it would have been easier for them to carry it out [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3440.3599999999997s)]
*  if they had wanted to. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3443.3999999999996s)]
*  We just don't know. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3444.7999999999997s)]
*  But I think, you know, events have now moved beyond that. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3445.68s)]
*  And we are now probably in the third or fourth day [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3448.44s)]
*  of the Ukrainian counteroffensive. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3450.64s)]
*  Of course, it has not been officially declared, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3452.24s)]
*  but there is major, major fighting happening now [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3453.88s)]
*  where Ukrainian armored divisions are seeking to, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3457.44s)]
*  you know, penetrate Russian defensive lines around Zaporizhzhia. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3462.48s)]
*  And so the long-awaited Ukrainian counteroffensive [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3466.76s)]
*  has certainly begun. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3469.6800000000003s)]
*  How does the dam relate to the Nord Stream pipeline? [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3471.08s)]
*  Because these are both situations where people are like, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3475.8s)]
*  who actually did it? What's their motivation? [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3478.08s)]
*  And let's face it, these are chaotic actors at times. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3480.7599999999998s)]
*  And figuring out who has the motivation to do these things [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3484.72s)]
*  seems like a leveling up kind of game [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3489.3999999999996s)]
*  because you can't put it past either party in some cases. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3491.68s)]
*  But in the case of Nord Stream, people saying, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3495.16s)]
*  hey, it was the Ukraine, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3497.8799999999997s)]
*  but then there's this argument [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3499.3999999999996s)]
*  that the Ukraine's not capable of doing it, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3500.3199999999997s)]
*  or maybe it was sanctioned by the US or the West [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3501.8799999999997s)]
*  and then executed by Ukraine. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3503.8399999999997s)]
*  Where do you wind up with all these? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3505.4399999999996s)]
*  So on Nord Stream, we're now on our third cover story. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3507.48s)]
*  The CIA sourcing their stenographers at the Washington Post [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3511.0s)]
*  have now claimed that it was six Ukrainian dudes in a yacht [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3514.32s)]
*  who blew up Nord Stream. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3518.64s)]
*  No, seriously, and if you look at this boat, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3521.28s)]
*  I'll put a photo of the boat on the screen. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3522.84s)]
*  It's pretty silly. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3524.72s)]
*  The 10-grain. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3526.12s)]
*  Yeah, the Ukrainians do not have a Navy [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3527.04s)]
*  and they certainly don't have Navy SEALs. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3529.76s)]
*  I don't believe they have the capability to, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3531.6s)]
*  by the way, this destruction of Nord Stream, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3534.2400000000002s)]
*  was this huge underwater steel and concrete structure. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3536.32s)]
*  It's not that deep though, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3541.8s)]
*  because it's only 150 or 200 feet deep at the lower point. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3543.16s)]
*  It's deep enough and it took a lot of explosives, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3547.12s)]
*  so they had to know what they were doing. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3549.08s)]
*  I dove 120 feet once, so it's not bad. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3551.36s)]
*  But the point is that when Nord Stream was first destroyed, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3553.24s)]
*  the media rushed out to say, well, the Russians did it, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3557.36s)]
*  even though the Russians had no motive to do it. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3559.92s)]
*  It was their own. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3562.16s)]
*  It's their pipeline. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3563.48s)]
*  They could just turn it off if they wanted to. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3564.36s)]
*  But this is what we hear, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3566.36s)]
*  is that every time something destructive happens, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3567.56s)]
*  it's the Russians did it. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3569.52s)]
*  Why would they attack themselves? [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3570.6000000000004s)]
*  Because they're so crazy. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3572.32s)]
*  We heard this with Nord Stream. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3573.48s)]
*  When Belgarod, which is a Russian district [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3575.0800000000004s)]
*  just across the border from Ukraine, was attacked, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3577.52s)]
*  it was claimed that the Russians did it. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3580.84s)]
*  These were Russian insurgents. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3582.48s)]
*  No, that's pretty silly. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3583.88s)]
*  It was Ukrainians dressed in Russian uniforms. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3585.1200000000003s)]
*  And just recently when there were drone attacks on Moscow, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3588.0800000000004s)]
*  we were also told that, oh, it wasn't the Ukrainians [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3590.6800000000003s)]
*  who did it, it was Russian dissidents or something, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3592.68s)]
*  which again, makes no sense. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3595.04s)]
*  So this is not to say that the Russians [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3596.68s)]
*  didn't blow up that dam. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3600.0s)]
*  It's just to say that whenever the story is rushed out, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3601.16s)]
*  that the Russians did something highly destructive, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3604.64s)]
*  you have to, we need to see some evidence here, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3606.48s)]
*  and we just don't know. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3608.9199999999996s)]
*  It's just hard to know. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3609.96s)]
*  The fog of war is thick. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3610.96s)]
*  All right, what did you think of Tucker's first show [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3613.7999999999997s)]
*  and his getting sued? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3617.64s)]
*  But he got, the tweet got at least like 90 million views, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3619.0s)]
*  which means the video probably got 10% of that or something. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3622.36s)]
*  So probably 10 million views. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3625.6800000000003s)]
*  I think the video yesterday was at 17 million views [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3626.52s)]
*  or something like that, so I'm sure it's more today. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3628.6800000000003s)]
*  So no, he's getting huge distribution through Twitter. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3630.6800000000003s)]
*  Arguably it's more distribution, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3633.6s)]
*  it's almost certainly more distribution [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3635.36s)]
*  than he got through Fox. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3637.1600000000003s)]
*  Fox was 3 million, right? [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3638.36s)]
*  Yeah, that's how many viewers he gets on Fox. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3639.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, Fox is half of that now [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3641.28s)]
*  because they've attrited so much viewership [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3642.88s)]
*  after Tucker left. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3646.08s)]
*  But look, the only thing that I think Tucker got through Fox [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3647.2000000000003s)]
*  was access to frankly a viewership base [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3650.76s)]
*  that's not very online. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3653.2000000000003s)]
*  There are a lot of old people who watch Fox [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3655.2400000000002s)]
*  who just aren't on social media. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3657.2400000000002s)]
*  That's it though. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3658.96s)]
*  Everybody else can see it on Twitter [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3660.0800000000004s)]
*  and he's getting more distribution on Twitter. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3661.96s)]
*  Super distribution is the way to go. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3664.88s)]
*  He's gonna get 25 million people. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3667.4s)]
*  Of course, monetizing it is the hard part [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3670.36s)]
*  because Fox's subscription revenue [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3672.5600000000004s)]
*  and everything else is advertising. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3675.0s)]
*  Yeah, but apparently he's creating a list. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3676.32s)]
*  He advertised the website TuckerGrolson.com [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3678.68s)]
*  at the end of his video [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3680.96s)]
*  and you can go there and sign up for. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3683.3599999999997s)]
*  You can subscribe direct and get it on his website. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3685.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, I don't think he's monetizing it yet, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3687.4s)]
*  but you can sign up for alerts and so forth. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3689.08s)]
*  So he's clearly creating a list of some kind. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3691.52s)]
*  Oh, that's probably because he, yeah, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3694.0s)]
*  with his contract, he's still getting paid. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3696.08s)]
*  And so he's like, yeah. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3698.3199999999997s)]
*  Daily Wire is the model. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3699.6s)]
*  I mean, they have got well over 100 million in revenue, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3700.8399999999997s)]
*  I understand, and they have a massive subscription business. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3703.92s)]
*  So there's a clear path. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3706.7599999999998s)]
*  Hey, listen, for the world's greatest moderator [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3708.44s)]

*  Well, except for the fund we already paid back. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3845.52s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3851.6000000000004s)]
*  I lost control of it in the first 90 seconds. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3852.44s)]
*  Why should tonight be any different? [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3855.96s)]
*  Except for the five-year-old fund [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3857.36s)]
*  that's already fully returned. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3858.5600000000004s)]
*  Okay, well, all right. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3860.2400000000002s)]
*  Whoa, easy. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3861.5600000000004s)]
*  So welcome to the Angel Summit. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3862.6000000000004s)]
*  These are my besties. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3865.44s)]
*  We do a podcast called All In. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3866.32s)]
*  We thought we'd do it live. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3868.0s)]
*  This is the fourth time we've ever appeared [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3869.2000000000003s)]
*  on stage together. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3872.5600000000004s)]
*  The first two times we're at Freeberg's LP conference [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3874.44s)]
*  in the Presidio, yeah? [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3877.96s)]
*  I resented that one too. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3879.92s)]
*  We know you are. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3882.96s)]
*  Saks's first time coming out to see humans since COVID. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3883.96s)]
*  He came out in his mask, he took his gloves off. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3887.76s)]
*  It was very uncomfortable for him, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3889.76s)]
*  but he eased into a seat. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3891.2400000000002s)]
*  And then of course we did the All In Summit [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3892.92s)]
*  last year in Miami. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3894.84s)]
*  And this is the fourth time. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3896.52s)]
*  So it's great to be out here. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3898.0s)]
*  We have a couple of news items on the docket [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3899.6000000000004s)]
*  we could start with, or we can go right to Q&A [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3901.52s)]
*  with these many audience members [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3904.0s)]
*  who have a lot of questions. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3905.92s)]
*  What would you gentlemen like to do? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3907.0s)]
*  Chamath has a few words he'd like to say. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3909.48s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3910.92s)]
*  Whatever you guys wanna do. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3912.1200000000003s)]
*  Chamath is drunk by the way. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3914.08s)]
*  He texted us. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3915.4s)]
*  You can see that grin on his face. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3917.16s)]
*  That's the Chamath grin he gives when he decided [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3919.08s)]
*  like X Capital, that he would not have LPs [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3922.6s)]
*  and he would just invest his own money. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3926.56s)]
*  He does not care. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3928.08s)]
*  So it's, the gloves are off. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3930.52s)]
*  Let's do Q&A. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3932.2400000000002s)]
*  Jay Levy says, Saks, what's the path for DeSantis [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3933.4s)]
*  to win the nomination and get the base of Trump? [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3936.2000000000003s)]
*  Ooh, red meat. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3939.56s)]
*  Oh, good politics. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3940.4s)]
*  Starting out with red meat. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3941.2400000000002s)]
*  Here we go. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3942.08s)]
*  I think the path basically is he has to win Iowa [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3943.08s)]
*  and or New Hampshire. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3946.16s)]
*  Is this that simple? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3947.32s)]
*  But keep in mind that Trump did not win Iowa last, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3949.2400000000002s)]
*  or in 2016, Tech Cruise did. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3953.28s)]
*  Iowa tends to be more religious. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3955.44s)]
*  I think DeSantis is trying to outflank Trump on the right [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3957.76s)]
*  actually on certain issues. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3962.36s)]
*  And so he's on the ground there campaigning. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3964.64s)]
*  From what I understand, he's generating a lot of interest [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3968.08s)]
*  and enthusiasm. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3970.36s)]
*  And he's gonna keep plugging away at it. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3971.96s)]
*  I think he's gonna out hustle Trump. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3973.84s)]
*  I'm not saying he's gonna win, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3975.6800000000003s)]
*  but I think he's gonna work harder. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3976.6800000000003s)]
*  And the path would be that over the next, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3978.52s)]
*  what is it like nine months, that Trump's style and message, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3981.7200000000003s)]
*  which is admittedly much more entertaining than DeSantis, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3986.36s)]
*  but kind of fatiguing, whether that kind of gets old [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3988.88s)]
*  and DeSantis is more like disciplined messaging. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3992.56s)]
*  People just kind of wake up and say, you know what? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3996.56s)]
*  Like, I don't really wanna go back to the chaos [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=3998.48s)]
*  of the whole Trump show. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4002.12s)]
*  This seems like better to me. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4003.3599999999997s)]
*  So that's basically what I think has to happen [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4006.24s)]
*  is Trump fatigue has to set in [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4009.12s)]
*  and people realize that there's a different way. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4010.7599999999998s)]
*  Was that CNN town hall a sign that some group of people [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4013.2s)]
*  find him incredibly entertaining [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4017.7599999999998s)]
*  and the media themselves want him back [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4019.3999999999996s)]
*  because it's great for ratings, a la Menken on session? [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4021.48s)]
*  Or is it a sign that like, my God, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4025.56s)]
*  that's so fucking exhausting, like you're saying, Sax. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4028.64s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4030.76s)]
*  I think that the base liked the town hall [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4031.7200000000003s)]
*  because it was Trump walking into the lion's den, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4035.2000000000003s)]
*  standing up to the mainstream media, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4038.0800000000004s)]
*  which is what they like. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4040.1200000000003s)]
*  But I don't think it did anything to help them in the general [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4041.7200000000003s)]
*  because I think that viewers who don't like Trump [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4043.96s)]
*  or aren't entertained by Trump, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4048.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's nothing there to really grab onto, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4049.4s)]
*  I don't think. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4052.1600000000003s)]
*  But look, I think your point about who does the media want [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4054.4s)]
*  to get the Republican nomination, definitely Trump [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4057.28s)]
*  because he's good for ratings. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4061.04s)]
*  And it really is that simple. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4061.88s)]
*  And they think they can beat him. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4063.32s)]
*  So right now, the Biden people, the Trump people, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4064.8s)]
*  and the media all want Trump over DeSantis. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4067.6800000000003s)]
*  And that is why DeSantis is getting dispatched [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4071.8s)]
*  by everybody right now is because, you know, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4074.88s)]
*  everyone's kind of aligned on this. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4079.28s)]
*  But the minute that Trump gets the nomination, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4080.6s)]
*  it's all going to turn. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4083.04s)]
*  The media all of a sudden is going to turn on Trump [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4083.88s)]
*  and then we're going to see what the real campaign's [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4086.1600000000003s)]
*  going to be about. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4087.76s)]
*  DeSantis isn't show business, as they said on Secession. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4088.6s)]
*  Was that the quote? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4091.12s)]
*  He's show business? [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4091.96s)]
*  He's box office? [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4092.7799999999997s)]
*  He's not box, yeah. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4093.62s)]
*  DeSantis isn't box office. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4095.0s)]
*  He's somebody who actually can execute running. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4096.12s)]
*  Right, but also that's why he'd be a good move [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4098.6s)]
*  for Republicans, I think, is because he doesn't give [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4101.6s)]
*  the Democrats as much to work with. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4103.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4105.92s)]
*  All right, let's see. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4106.76s)]
*  Trump's entertaining, but he gives his enemies [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4107.6s)]
*  so much to work with. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4108.88s)]
*  All right, another question from the back. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4110.0s)]
*  Go ahead, stand up, tell us your name. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4111.76s)]
*  Yeah, Sal Dahar from Boston. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4113.48s)]
*  And the question is much less exciting. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4116.72s)]
*  Regarding sort of the problem of bank runs [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4122.56s)]
*  and bank insurance by the Fed and bailing out, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4126.88s)]
*  you know, average people bailing out wealthy people. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4130.84s)]
*  I've heard a lot of solutions about this. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4135.780000000001s)]
*  I've been in cell careers and banking for a while. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4137.56s)]
*  The idea of having senior management and the board [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4141.56s)]
*  have direct liability if the Feds have to step in [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4144.96s)]
*  to rescue the bank. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4149.2s)]
*  Do you think that that could be a step [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4150.04s)]
*  in the right direction in preventing banks [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4152.24s)]
*  from taking risks they really shouldn't have taken? [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4155.36s)]
*  I mean, the 2008 disaster, the subprime crisis [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4157.44s)]
*  could have been addressed with this. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4160.72s)]
*  I think this crisis with SVP could have been addressed [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4162.04s)]
*  with management just having a lot more to lose. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4165.36s)]
*  Okay, so let me just first take issue [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4167.66s)]
*  with the terminology of bailout. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4170.28s)]
*  I know that's what everyone calls it. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4171.68s)]
*  The bailout in my mind is when the shareholders [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4173.6s)]
*  or the bondholders of the bank get bailed out by taxpayers. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4176.08s)]
*  That happened in 2008, it did not happen here. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4179.360000000001s)]
*  Here the question was whether depositors [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4181.4400000000005s)]
*  get made whole or not. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4184.6s)]
*  I personally don't consider that a bailout. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4186.620000000001s)]
*  I understand that there are people who do, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4188.400000000001s)]
*  but it is a slightly different issue. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4190.160000000001s)]
*  As to the bank management, you know, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4192.26s)]
*  you're talking about like a strict liability standard here [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4195.92s)]
*  that, I mean, basically you're talking about [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4198.6s)]
*  piercing the corporate veil and making the bank executives [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4201.56s)]
*  and their directors liable for mismanagement of the bank. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4205.64s)]
*  And that is- [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4209.84s)]
*  That's a pretty high bar. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4211.280000000001s)]
*  That's a really high bar. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4212.120000000001s)]
*  And the problem with it is that I would never serve [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4213.320000000001s)]
*  on the board of a bank. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4215.96s)]
*  I mean, I probably wouldn't anyway, [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4216.8s)]
*  but if you told me that I could be liable- [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4218.120000000001s)]
*  Piercing the bail is really dangerous. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4221.52s)]
*  Right, we have a thing called the business judgment rule [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4224.56s)]
*  in Delaware where if directors and officers of the company [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4227.0s)]
*  perform their job in a good faith way, [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4232.08s)]
*  making the best decisions they can, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4236.28s)]
*  and it goes wrong, they're not typically liable for that. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4238.36s)]
*  Maybe the corporation is liable, [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4241.56s)]
*  but they're not personally liable. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4242.64s)]
*  I'd look, if you did that, [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4244.6s)]
*  the managers wouldn't invest the cash in anything [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4247.34s)]
*  because they wouldn't want to take any risk of loss. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4250.92s)]
*  And in order to operate the business, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4253.26s)]
*  which has a bunch of people working there [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4254.6s)]
*  and a bunch of banks that they got to operate, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4256.0s)]
*  they're going to charge you a fee to hold your money for you. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4257.2s)]
*  And so what happens is interest rates turn negative [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4259.56s)]
*  and you basically have to pay someone [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4261.92s)]
*  to hold your money for you. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4263.2s)]
*  And that's what's a little bit messed up [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4264.4800000000005s)]
*  about the way the banking system works today [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4265.8s)]
*  is you're effectively giving a money manager [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4267.8s)]
*  the right to invest your money for you. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4269.74s)]
*  They take your money, they pay you a low interest rate, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4271.6s)]
*  and they go invest it in high interest rate stuff [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4273.56s)]
*  by taking on risk with your capital. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4275.4s)]
*  And ultimately they can take losses on that. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4277.56s)]
*  And if you wanted to make them liable for those losses, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4279.8s)]
*  they're not going to take that risk. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4281.94s)]
*  And the bank is going to have to change its business model [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4283.52s)]
*  from being an arbitrage business [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4286.0s)]
*  to being a service fee business. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4288.160000000001s)]
*  And they're going to have to figure out other ways [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4289.56s)]
*  to charge you service fees, [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4290.64s)]
*  including charging you to hold your money [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4292.080000000001s)]
*  in order to make money. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4294.080000000001s)]
*  And that's what a lot of the banks are now doing, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4295.080000000001s)]
*  First Republic and others have now proclaimed [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4296.64s)]
*  that they're going to start charging [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4298.84s)]
*  a lot more service fees to hold your money [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4299.72s)]
*  and they're going to start taking a lot less risk. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4301.64s)]
*  So we're already headed in that direction. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4303.4400000000005s)]
*  But that's fundamentally what I think would be the net result. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4305.820000000001s)]
*  Let's take another question from the audience. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4307.660000000001s)]
*  Good evening, I'm Lisa Song Sutton, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4310.200000000001s)]
*  I'm from Las Vegas, Nevada, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4311.96s)]
*  GP in the Veteran Fund. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4313.36s)]
*  As investors, you all invest in entrepreneurs, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4315.24s)]
*  theoretically support American entrepreneurship. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4318.64s)]
*  What role, if any, do you think VCs should have [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4321.28s)]
*  in shaping, advocating, supporting [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4324.64s)]
*  conservative economic policy in the country? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4327.6s)]
*  Shumoff? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4330.32s)]
*  Zero. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4332.08s)]
*  I think that you have to know the role that you're doing [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4334.9400000000005s)]
*  if you're a venture investor, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4338.86s)]
*  which is you're buying a deep out of the money option. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4340.96s)]
*  And I think that you want to motivate [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4344.36s)]
*  the people that you are partnering with [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4346.84s)]
*  to take really thoughtful but outsized risks. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4349.8s)]
*  And so I don't think there's a lot of room [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4353.0s)]
*  for conservativism. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4356.0s)]
*  I do think that there's room for misallocation of capital. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4358.32s)]
*  And I think that there's people that can help guide that. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4362.44s)]
*  But the reality is that when you start a company, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4364.9800000000005s)]
*  it's 95% likely to fail. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4368.04s)]
*  And the venture investor is signing up for a 70 or 80% [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4371.08s)]
*  probability that they lose capital, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4376.74s)]
*  maybe a 10 or 15 or 20% chance [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4379.12s)]
*  that they get their money back, [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4381.04s)]
*  and then the small 5% chance that it becomes reasonable. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4382.0s)]
*  So in that lens, I don't think that's where [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4386.68s)]
*  conservative economic policies really should play a role. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4391.74s)]
*  I think you just kind of got to go for it. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4396.6s)]
*  And if it's going to win, it's going to win big. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4399.04s)]
*  And if it doesn't, you lose one extra money. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4401.360000000001s)]
*  I think like where you want conservative economic [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4404.360000000001s)]
*  and rational thinking is when you go to the extreme [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4407.0s)]
*  other end, which is just like the large scale decisions [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4410.360000000001s)]
*  that affect the economic vibrancy of the country [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4413.8s)]
*  in which you live. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4417.12s)]
*  And there on the margins, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4418.280000000001s)]
*  you probably want to be more rational than irrational. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4419.240000000001s)]
*  But as a venture investor, I think you want to be irrational. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4422.6s)]
*  But I also think you have to be very judgmental. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4425.28s)]
*  And the reality is that most companies aren't going to work [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4428.28s)]
*  and most people, this may seem controversial. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4430.719999999999s)]
*  Most people actually, when push comes to shove, [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4436.12s)]
*  are a little afraid of the decisions they need to make [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4440.5199999999995s)]
*  to be truly successful. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4442.58s)]
*  They're not willing to fire the people [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4445.88s)]
*  that they need to fire. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4447.04s)]
*  They're not willing to be extreme [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4447.88s)]
*  in the product they want to build. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4449.099999999999s)]
*  They're not willing to price it. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4450.08s)]
*  They're not willing to go to market in an extreme way. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4451.5599999999995s)]
*  And it tends to be that these companies fail [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4454.16s)]
*  because of that. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4456.28s)]
*  A lack of courage, a lack of conviction. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4457.2s)]
*  I don't want to say it's a lack of courage or conviction [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4459.639999999999s)]
*  because that's a very heightened word. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4460.96s)]
*  I just think that when push comes to shove, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4463.04s)]
*  most people implode with the pressure [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4464.5599999999995s)]
*  of making a very, very hard decision. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4466.84s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4469.599999999999s)]
*  All right. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4470.44s)]
*  In my experience, yours could be different. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4471.28s)]
*  No, I mean, I agree with you largely. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4472.92s)]
*  When a startup does fail, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4475.36s)]
*  if the experienced people around it are watching [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4477.8s)]
*  and can't get through to the founder or the founding team, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4479.88s)]
*  it's typically they are blocking their own success. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4482.64s)]
*  They're unwilling to fire their co-founder, their CTO, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4486.04s)]
*  as the example you're alluding to perhaps, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4488.76s)]
*  or raise the price of the software and lose some customers [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4490.84s)]
*  or to drive people to work harder [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4493.4800000000005s)]
*  because you've got a competitor in the space. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4495.160000000001s)]
*  And that's why you see extreme people win in our pursuit. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4497.120000000001s)]
*  And I think there's been just a great fallacy [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4501.52s)]
*  that's gone on that you can have live work balance [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4503.8s)]
*  or life work balance. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4506.72s)]
*  And you could have this nirvana where you have it all. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4507.8s)]
*  The fact is the great companies are made by people [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4510.76s)]
*  who make great sacrifices, period, full stop. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4512.92s)]
*  And if you're not willing to make the great sacrifice, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4515.320000000001s)]
*  you're not gonna have great outcomes. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4516.92s)]
*  Hi, David Samuel. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4518.400000000001s)]
*  Earlier today, Jason, you had kind of a doomsday [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4520.12s)]
*  or AI panelist. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4522.4400000000005s)]
*  And my question is, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4524.280000000001s)]
*  you guys have been thrust into the public spotlight [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4525.280000000001s)]
*  and we look at deep fakes in the next year or two. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4528.4400000000005s)]
*  As you talk about, you know, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4530.96s)]
*  tweeting on Friday versus Wednesday, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4532.280000000001s)]
*  how do you think about somebody having each of you [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4535.04s)]
*  saying things that you did not say [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4537.92s)]
*  and like, how might we know whether Chamath said that [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4541.04s)]
*  or it was a deep fake saying it? [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4544.719999999999s)]
*  I already have that problem. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4546.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4548.4s)]
*  It was an article on Business Insider last week [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4549.24s)]
*  where somebody was saying, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4551.48s)]
*  I had a phone call I never had. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4552.5199999999995s)]
*  So how do we solve this, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4554.32s)]
*  especially for you as public folks? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4555.44s)]
*  Two things, two things. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4557.639999999999s)]
*  One, I don't think people can say more outlandish [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4558.759999999999s)]
*  and damaging things in AI than we say ourselves [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4561.16s)]
*  on this podcast at times. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4565.639999999999s)]
*  But number two, you know, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4567.84s)]
*  as we've discussed many times on this podcast, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4569.8s)]
*  we have rebooted our trust in institutions, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4572.24s)]
*  what we read, what we say. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4577.08s)]
*  And I think people are now assuming [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4578.6s)]
*  they're being manipulated, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4581.56s)]
*  assuming something might be fake news or doctored. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4583.12s)]
*  And I think it's like, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4586.28s)]
*  people are building up a much higher resiliency [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4587.84s)]
*  to bullshit lies, manipulation. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4589.88s)]
*  And if I were to ask a hundred people, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4592.72s)]
*  what is the bias of CNN, New York Times, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4595.24s)]
*  Fox, MSNBC, NPR? [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4598.72s)]
*  90 out of 100 Americans could describe it almost exactly. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4601.4400000000005s)]
*  People are not dumb. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4605.4400000000005s)]
*  This is another fallacy I think we have in this country [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4606.72s)]
*  is that people are dumb and they're gonna get suckered. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4609.04s)]
*  People are kind of figuring it out. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4611.12s)]
*  And we've seen deep fakes for what, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4613.04s)]
*  five years, 10 years now? [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4614.8s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, you know, [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4616.4400000000005s)]
*  Luke Skywalker didn't look really good in The Mandalorian, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4617.280000000001s)]
*  but there's a kid who redid it, [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4619.96s)]
*  and now Dolly 2 is doing it. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4621.24s)]
*  I think we're kind of inoculating ourselves too. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4623.0s)]
*  What do you think, Freeberg? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4625.68s)]
*  Deep fakes and truth. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4628.320000000001s)]
*  When the Gutenberg Press was invented, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4630.08s)]
*  a bunch of fake shit was printed and people believed it. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4632.56s)]
*  I don't think the current iteration with deep fakes [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4636.8s)]
*  is very different from any form of mass media being used [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4641.12s)]
*  to tell people untruth. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4646.24s)]
*  It's called the crusades. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4647.72s)]
*  What's that? [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4649.0s)]
*  It's called the crusades. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4649.84s)]
*  The crusades, yeah. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4650.68s)]
*  No, I mean, but look, I mean, [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4651.52s)]
*  You're 100% right. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4653.96s)]
*  But I don't wanna speak about religion [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4654.8s)]
*  negatively in that way. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4656.400000000001s)]
*  It is one of many institutions of power [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4657.24s)]
*  that leveraged mass media historically [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4660.28s)]
*  to get people to believe things, to do things, [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4664.4s)]
*  and to ultimately be able to tax people [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4666.96s)]
*  and get them to provide capital and labor [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4668.76s)]
*  in the interest of those who are in power. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4671.8s)]
*  And the system of deep faking is one of a long string [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4674.04s)]
*  of using the current toolkit to take mass media [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4680.28s)]
*  and follow that same track. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4684.24s)]
*  So it will be dealt with in the same way [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4686.04s)]
*  that things have been dealt with [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4687.84s)]
*  that have been fake news in the past, [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4689.72s)]
*  which is that there will be an opposing voice [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4692.5199999999995s)]
*  and there will be counter arguments and there will be debate [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4694.28s)]
*  and it will be rancorous and it will be noisy [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4696.96s)]
*  and it will be hard to discern and alternatives will emerge [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4699.64s)]
*  and tools that identify deep fakes will emerge [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4702.48s)]
*  and it will be the same ongoing battle [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4704.68s)]
*  and seeking of the truth that humanity has tried to do [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4706.64s)]
*  since the dawn of mass media. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4711.92s)]
*  Yesterday's conspiracy theories [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4714.24s)]
*  are like tomorrow's Pulitzer prizes, I always say. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4715.96s)]
*  If you look at Shinne and O'Connor ripping up [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4718.32s)]
*  the Pope's picture on Saturday Night Live in protest [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4720.44s)]
*  and saying this is the true enemy, [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4723.2s)]
*  they're molesting children and then the Boston Globe [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4726.04s)]
*  and the movie Spotlight is about them. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4729.42s)]
*  A decades later, winning a Pulitzer for uncovering [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4731.32s)]
*  what anybody who's in the room who's Catholic [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4735.5599999999995s)]
*  in the 70s and 80s knew or had heard was going on. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4737.679999999999s)]
*  And so maybe the timeframe is shortening [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4740.96s)]
*  between when we're being lied to and when we figure it out. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4745.0s)]
*  I actually think it's interesting and good [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4746.64s)]
*  because it forces us to find ways [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4748.2s)]
*  to find the truth more effectively. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4750.0s)]
*  And without the antagonism, I think it's absent. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4752.36s)]
*  What is the truth? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4758.96s)]
*  You don't force that debate, you don't force that question [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4759.92s)]
*  and this will start to reveal ways that we can kind of [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4762.88s)]
*  find things that are actual evidentiary things [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4766.4s)]
*  versus things that someone told me [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4769.28s)]
*  with either historically anecdote or innuendo [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4771.7s)]
*  or I'm a person in power or I'm an authority [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4774.84s)]
*  or I'm an expert and nowadays it's like [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4776.04s)]
*  I'm a piece of media, you should believe me [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4778.0s)]
*  or here I'm an image of a person [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4780.42s)]
*  and that's not gonna be the case anymore. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4781.92s)]
*  Hi, I'm Jeff, a full-time corporate VC and part-time angel. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4783.4s)]
*  My question's about AI and higher education [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4787.48s)]
*  and it's actually some covert parenting advice [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4790.26s)]
*  so you can decide who that's relevant for. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4793.04s)]
*  My son just finished his freshman year of college [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4796.36s)]
*  and I'm questioning what the future is for him [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4798.56s)]
*  in higher education given all the change that AI [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4801.76s)]
*  is going to have on every career and every profession [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4804.2s)]
*  and I'm wondering what advice you'd give to your child [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4809.7s)]
*  or someone who's in college right now [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4812.56s)]
*  for what's an area of study that maybe won't be disrupted [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4815.12s)]
*  by AI or an area that AI, you'll get leverage [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4819.92s)]
*  from your education through AI. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4825.280000000001s)]
*  I think the reality is that most of the existing jobs [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4827.8s)]
*  that we have in the United States [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4831.28s)]
*  are going to go to lower cost locations [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4834.36s)]
*  that have that tool chain to accelerate their capability. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4838.8s)]
*  So we're gonna have to reinvent the workforce [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4845.04s)]
*  and the things that we do over the next 30 or 40 years [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4849.88s)]
*  to stay relevant. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4854.04s)]
*  That's probably like, I think that should just be [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4855.66s)]
*  the operating principle. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4858.2s)]
*  If you think about it, we used to run great call centers. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4860.52s)]
*  Okay, those call centers were outsourced [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4863.64s)]
*  to the Philippines and India, [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4865.160000000001s)]
*  but in the next five or 10 years, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4866.8s)]
*  you'll have this flawless unaccented English [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4869.76s)]
*  or even more eerily perfectly accented English [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4872.6s)]
*  for the zip code of the person that's calling in [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4877.120000000001s)]
*  so that it sounds like they're talking to somebody [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4879.240000000001s)]
*  that's literally their neighbor. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4880.9800000000005s)]
*  That's like, just makes so much sense, right? [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4883.160000000001s)]
*  So it's like all this stuff is gonna happen [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4885.080000000001s)]
*  where like all these classes of jobs are gonna go away. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4886.64s)]
*  I saw this article where a lawyer, two lawyers, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4889.24s)]
*  used chat GPT to submit a legal brief. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4892.2s)]
*  The problem was that it cited cases that didn't exist [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4896.44s)]
*  and now they're gonna be disbarred. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4899.2s)]
*  So this is like serious business, right? [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4902.08s)]
*  Like you can't do that. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4904.0599999999995s)]
*  Like that's like real legal malfeasance. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4905.24s)]
*  So what are your kids studying? [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4909.2s)]
*  Malpractice. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4910.04s)]
*  In college. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4911.44s)]
*  You know, if I had to choose something for my kids, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4913.96s)]
*  I would probably tell them to do something mathematical [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4916.06s)]
*  or biological. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4921.9800000000005s)]
*  The reason I would point them to math [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4923.88s)]
*  is that I think that it's irrefutable. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4925.820000000001s)]
*  There's this great clip between Ricky Gervais [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4927.9800000000005s)]
*  and Stephen Colbert. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4931.02s)]
*  You guys should go and Google this. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4932.280000000001s)]
*  But it's a clip where he's on the Colbert show [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4934.06s)]
*  and Colbert is a deeply devout Catholic [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4936.580000000001s)]
*  and he's offended by the fact [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4939.780000000001s)]
*  that Ricky Gervais doesn't believe in God. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4941.26s)]
*  And he asks him, why don't you believe in God? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4943.64s)]
*  And Ricky Gervais says, look, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4945.38s)]
*  if we wiped out all the books in the world, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4946.86s)]
*  in a thousand years, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4949.9800000000005s)]
*  everything that's scientific and mathematical [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4951.18s)]
*  would be reestablished. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4953.18s)]
*  But everything that is religious or theoretically not, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4955.02s)]
*  you know, mythical, if you wanna say, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4957.58s)]
*  would look very, very different. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4960.5s)]
*  And that's why I don't believe in God. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4963.900000000001s)]
*  I'm not trying to question that, [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4965.9400000000005s)]
*  but it's a way of answering this question, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4967.26s)]
*  which is I would try to point my children [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4969.26s)]
*  to the body of knowledge that's largely irrefutable, [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4971.26s)]
*  which is biological and mathematical [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4975.780000000001s)]
*  versus belief oriented, [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4977.860000000001s)]
*  because I think these tools will change one's beliefs. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4979.14s)]
*  I've been thinking about this a lot too. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4981.38s)]
*  I think teaching them to be entrepreneurial, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4982.7s)]
*  resilient, worldly, ability to communicate, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4985.5s)]
*  ability to lead other people in teams, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4988.3s)]
*  that stuff's not gonna go away, [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4991.58s)]
*  communication skill, et cetera. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4993.3s)]
*  And I'm encouraging everybody who I work with [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4994.58s)]
*  to just use Chat GPT-4 and Bard every day [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=4998.62s)]
*  for every single thing that they do. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5001.9s)]
*  My base thesis right now is that the job freezes, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5004.3s)]
*  the hiring freezes at all these companies is indefinite. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5011.34s)]
*  I'm assuming it's indefinite, [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5014.42s)]
*  because the amount of work it takes [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5015.599999999999s)]
*  to write a job requisition is more work in some cases [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5016.9s)]
*  than actually automating with AI or ready, the job function. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5021.5599999999995s)]
*  And so I think 20 person companies might double in size [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5026.44s)]
*  in the next two or three years, but still have 20 people. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5030.96s)]
*  This is gonna be a big challenge for society. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5034.4s)]
*  And if that does come to pass, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5037.08s)]
*  there's just gonna be large swaths of people [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5039.879999999999s)]
*  who are not gonna be able to get job interviews [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5041.259999999999s)]
*  for anything other than service jobs. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5043.759999999999s)]
*  We need a lot more plumbers, electricians, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5046.759999999999s)]
*  waiters, et cetera. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5048.919999999999s)]
*  Those probably jobs won't go away, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5050.44s)]
*  especially if we don't let people immigrate. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5052.16s)]
*  So I am super enthusiastic about that efficiency, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5053.46s)]
*  but I think it also means you have to be entrepreneurial [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5057.54s)]
*  because if you can't get a job and you can't get mentored, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5060.26s)]
*  you better create your own opportunity. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5062.74s)]
*  You better create your own company. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5064.1s)]
*  And that's what I'm seeing. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5065.78s)]
*  That's the game on the field right now. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5067.18s)]
*  Two or three people who don't have job offers [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5068.42s)]
*  from Uber and Airbnb and Google and Facebook, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5070.26s)]
*  just saying, fuck it, let's start a company, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5072.7s)]
*  because there's nothing else for us to do. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5074.74s)]
*  And those are highly skilled people right now doing that. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5076.6s)]
*  I'll say two quick things about this topic. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5079.28s)]
*  So one is I think there's a lot of AI fear porn [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5081.06s)]
*  out there right now. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5084.42s)]
*  And I just think that all of these doomer scenarios, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5085.38s)]
*  they're not gonna play out overnight. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5090.5s)]
*  I mean, this is gonna take a while. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5091.9800000000005s)]
*  Second, if you think about job elimination, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5094.860000000001s)]
*  it's gonna be some super specialized jobs. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5099.780000000001s)]
*  So for example, I wouldn't want to be a radiologist [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5102.54s)]
*  right now, but doctors will be fine. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5105.660000000001s)]
*  So I think if you're thinking about [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5108.82s)]
*  going into a job category that's super specialized [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5111.74s)]
*  and clearly in the way of AI, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5115.42s)]
*  then that probably is not a good idea. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5118.139999999999s)]
*  But most general skills, like you're talking about, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5120.94s)]
*  and most job categories are gonna be fine. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5125.5s)]
*  There's just gonna be some specialties within them [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5128.139999999999s)]
*  that may get dislocated. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5130.98s)]
*  I wouldn't want to be a truck driver either [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5133.5s)]
*  because of self-driving. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5136.0s)]
*  But transportation companies are still gonna exist. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5137.5s)]
*  So I think you just want to be careful [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5140.18s)]
*  about super specialization, I think. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5143.22s)]
*  But building general skills is always really good. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5145.02s)]
*  That really should be the point of college. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5147.26s)]
*  Where would you put lawyers and accountants on that? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5148.78s)]
*  I'm curious. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5151.0s)]
*  They're sufficiently general that I don't think [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5152.3s)]
*  they're gonna be eliminated. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5154.42s)]
*  But will they be able to do five times the amount of work [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5155.86s)]
*  therefore we won't need as many? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5157.92s)]
*  They may be able to get more done, yeah. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5159.74s)]
*  I would expect them to be able to get more done. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5161.6s)]
*  But I don't necessarily think that means [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5163.7s)]
*  we'll need less of them. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5166.1s)]
*  I mean, the old story about lawyers is that [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5168.179999999999s)]
*  there was one lawyer in a town that had no business. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5170.639999999999s)]
*  Second lawyer came to town and they were both more busy [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5173.44s)]
*  than they knew what to do with. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5176.08s)]
*  So, you know. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5177.4s)]
*  Induced litigation. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5179.24s)]
*  Yeah, lawyers get 30% more productive. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5180.08s)]
*  They file 30% more lawsuits and you know. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5182.5599999999995s)]
*  We're good. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5184.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5185.719999999999s)]
*  All right, let's take another question. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5186.5599999999995s)]
*  These are great questions so far. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5187.38s)]
*  Hey guys, Rick Spencer. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5188.219999999999s)]
*  I hope Chamath gets to choose the wine [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5190.0s)]
*  this evening for dinner. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5191.32s)]
*  I did not get to choose your wine, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5192.16s)]
*  so I apologize in advance. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5193.679999999999s)]
*  What kind of water would you get? [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5195.28s)]
*  This is a 2018 Chateau Con Lafond, Brazil. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5197.32s)]
*  I love the best tea. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5200.64s)]
*  Okay, question. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5202.76s)]
*  So you've talked recently in episodes about the speed [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5203.68s)]
*  of AI, the adoption and how the winners are still unknown. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5206.6s)]
*  That was reinforced in the sessions today. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5209.84s)]
*  A room full of investors. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5211.6s)]
*  How are you thinking differently about your investment, [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5213.3s)]
*  you know, your strategic investment decisions [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5215.4800000000005s)]
*  and your strategy? [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5217.4800000000005s)]
*  Are there opportunities to look at venture investing [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5218.76s)]
*  differently like venture studios, you know, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5221.0s)]
*  in the future of AI? [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5223.88s)]
*  I had this conversation earlier today. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5224.92s)]
*  I think I started a company in 2006 [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5226.36s)]
*  where we took large data sets [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5229.84s)]
*  and we built predictive models from those data sets. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5233.48s)]
*  And we use those predictive models [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5235.96s)]
*  to make analytical tools available to a specific vertical, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5237.36s)]
*  in our case, agriculture farmers. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5240.4s)]
*  And the models were both deterministic, [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5242.5199999999995s)]
*  meaning there was kind of definitions, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5245.94s)]
*  algorithmic definitions of physical parameters. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5248.12s)]
*  And there was like all the statistical inference [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5250.4s)]
*  that you get from large data sets. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5252.24s)]
*  And it made recommendations for farmers. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5254.6s)]
*  What a lot of people are calling AI today [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5258.320000000001s)]
*  is fundamentally a predictive model on text, on language. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5261.52s)]
*  I am making a language predictor that gives you a sentence. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5266.96s)]
*  And it seems so profound because it is how we all interact [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5271.0s)]
*  with computers and interact with one another. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5274.240000000001s)]
*  And as a result, it is kind of viewed as this sea change [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5276.96s)]
*  across all of these industries instantaneously. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5280.160000000001s)]
*  It's this whole new era. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5282.740000000001s)]
*  But the fact is that generally speaking, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5284.32s)]
*  the digitization of things and the amount of data [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5287.32s)]
*  that's being generated on earth is going up [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5289.92s)]
*  by some order of magnitude every number of months. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5291.639999999999s)]
*  And our ability to make predictions [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5295.04s)]
*  and build predictive models that are useful [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5296.92s)]
*  to specific vertical segments [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5298.639999999999s)]
*  is improving every sequential cycle [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5300.44s)]
*  that this is happening across every vertical. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5303.599999999999s)]
*  And it is continued and it hasn't changed [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5306.4s)]
*  and it's not any different. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5308.599999999999s)]
*  So there's in this area of genomics and bioinformatics, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5309.96s)]
*  there is an absolute sea change happening in human health [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5313.72s)]
*  in synthetic biology and our ability to understand [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5316.4800000000005s)]
*  and predict the biological world and make changes [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5319.360000000001s)]
*  and create new drugs, create new systems [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5321.4800000000005s)]
*  for producing molecules, for producing things [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5324.280000000001s)]
*  that humans consume. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5326.5s)]
*  And it is all buoyed by machine learning [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5327.96s)]
*  applied to large data sets in genomics [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5331.16s)]
*  and other metadata associated with human health and biology. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5333.08s)]
*  And we're seeing the same thing in other areas, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5336.6s)]
*  whether it's chemistry, material science, [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5338.64s)]
*  industrial application, consumer markets and so on. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5342.12s)]
*  The era of what people are now calling AI [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5345.2s)]
*  is an interface layer of language [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5348.4s)]
*  that's really creating transformational opportunities [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5350.12s)]
*  on how these tools, how these systems, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5352.28s)]
*  how these models can be utilized and provided [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5354.16s)]
*  to all these different verticals. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5356.82s)]
*  And allows us to rethink business models, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5357.8s)]
*  to rethink interaction models [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5360.0s)]
*  and to really change the economics of different businesses [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5362.5599999999995s)]
*  and the utility and the productivity of humans [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5365.36s)]
*  because it is about speech, it is about communication, [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5367.5599999999995s)]
*  it's about what we fundamentally do [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5369.88s)]
*  as a species. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5372.96s)]
*  So I would argue that the general trajectory [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5373.8s)]
*  of machine learning, the general trajectory [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5377.72s)]
*  of data generation and our ability to make predictions, [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5379.54s)]
*  generate value across all these different markets [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5381.92s)]
*  is continuing in the way that it has been continuing [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5384.44s)]
*  for the last 20 years. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5387.2s)]
*  And it is profound in its own right. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5388.8s)]
*  And I wouldn't say that there's a massive sea change [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5391.08s)]
*  in that evolution because of large language models. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5393.6s)]
*  Large language models create another set of opportunities. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5397.88s)]
*  So I would kind of create a distinction [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5400.48s)]
*  and make sure that the categorization [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5402.04s)]

*  Foundational models are getting disrupted every other week. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5410.0s)]
*  They're being decreased in size, [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5412.5599999999995s)]
*  parameters are being reduced, they're being commoditized. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5414.24s)]
*  You can run these things on M2 chips. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5416.679999999999s)]

*  it's gonna be worth zero because someone open sourced [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5424.679999999999s)]
*  the exact same thing that you can now do for 100K. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5427.16s)]

*  Chamath, you wanna add what you're looking at? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5441.0s)]
*  I think this is gonna be the big question, yeah. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5442.84s)]
*  Six or seven years ago, [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5444.64s)]
*  there was this Google earnings release [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5447.4400000000005s)]
*  where they talked about building their own silicon. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5449.4800000000005s)]
*  I've told this story before, but I pinged those guys [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5451.8s)]
*  and I was basically like, I just wanna meet the team [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5454.8s)]
*  that built the TPU. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5456.96s)]
*  Long story short, a year later, I put them in business. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5459.16s)]
*  And we've been building silicon for this moment for years. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5461.8s)]
*  It's been really, really hard. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5466.36s)]
*  And the reason it's been really, really hard [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5469.84s)]
*  is that Nvidia is just really, really good. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5472.24s)]
*  CUDA is very, very complete. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5475.599999999999s)]
*  And it's just very difficult to justify [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5479.639999999999s)]
*  why one would build, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5481.599999999999s)]
*  once you have something that you think is profound, [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5485.24s)]
*  implement multiple SDKs to multiple points of silicon [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5488.8s)]
*  just doesn't make any sense. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5491.76s)]
*  That being said, I still think you need to be [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5494.12s)]
*  at the absolute bottom of the stack [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5496.4800000000005s)]
*  and the absolute top of the stack. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5498.12s)]
*  I think I'm a little too biased for saying the former, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5499.64s)]
*  which is I'm hoping that there's vendor diversity [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5503.4400000000005s)]
*  and silicon diversity, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5506.88s)]
*  because I think it's gonna be really important. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5508.88s)]
*  I don't think we wanna have a world [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5510.52s)]
*  where Nvidia runs away with it. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5512.0s)]
*  So I think there's investment opportunity there [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5513.16s)]
*  just because I think everybody should want that to happen. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5515.48s)]
*  And then at the absolute top, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5518.679999999999s)]
*  Freeberg's right that all these foundational models, [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5521.44s)]
*  I think are changing so rapidly [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5526.04s)]
*  that the thing that you wanna figure out is like, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5527.599999999999s)]
*  what are you seeding it with to drive learning that's unique? [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5529.599999999999s)]
*  And that's a data problem. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5533.04s)]
*  So there's an example that I've given. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5534.48s)]
*  This was an example given to me by Nikesh Arora. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5536.24s)]
*  So I'm not gonna take credit for it. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5540.679999999999s)]
*  He's the CEO of Palo Alto Networks. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5542.24s)]
*  But he was telling me, when you look at travel, [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5543.64s)]
*  the travel space, all the public travel companies [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5549.320000000001s)]
*  are like $300 billion of public market cap, [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5551.4800000000005s)]
*  Expedia, Travelocity, all these companies, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5554.64s)]
*  but they're pure middlemen. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5557.6s)]
*  And they sit on top of a data feed [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5560.88s)]
*  that comes from a handful of companies. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5562.84s)]
*  One of them is Sabre. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5564.76s)]
*  And so I went and I looked at Sabre. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5567.240000000001s)]
*  Sabre is like a $1.3 billion company, [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5569.68s)]
*  a small little company. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5572.16s)]
*  But they are the ones that go into all the airlines, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5574.12s)]
*  extract all this gobbledygook data, normalize it, [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5577.12s)]
*  and allow Expedia, Travelocity, Booking.com to exist. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5580.36s)]
*  In a world of machine learning where, [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5585.36s)]
*  an AI where theoretically you can have [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5587.4s)]
*  conversational languages inside of WhatsApp [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5589.16s)]
*  or Messenger or Instagram, you see this beautiful picture, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5591.72s)]
*  you're like, book me a ticket to that place. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5595.0s)]
*  Well, Sabre is actually the key value creator there. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5598.2s)]
*  And all these Expedia examples that are plugins at GBT [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5604.5599999999995s)]
*  make no sense. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5607.12s)]
*  They make no economic sense. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5608.639999999999s)]
*  Those companies should go to zero. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5610.08s)]
*  So I've used that as a way, a forcing function for me [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5612.639999999999s)]
*  to try to prove that there's really these two barbells, [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5616.04s)]
*  it's a barbell, bookends. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5619.4s)]
*  One is a silicon and one of these [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5621.2s)]
*  sort of like data providers. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5622.8s)]
*  That's probably an investable thing that's defensible. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5624.08s)]
*  Everything in the middle, I think what Friedberg said [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5627.6s)]
*  is true, which is today it looks like it's worth [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5630.28s)]
*  a couple billion dollars, tomorrow's worth nothing. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5632.36s)]
*  And so I think you have to be very careful. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5635.08s)]
*  If you listen to, there's an interview [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5636.76s)]
*  that Stephen Wolfram did with Lex Friedman. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5638.84s)]
*  Did you guys listen to it a few weeks ago? [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5641.28s)]
*  I had him on my pod a couple weeks ago, [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5643.2s)]
*  but haven't heard the Friedman. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5644.72s)]
*  Wolfram? Yeah, he's incredible, yeah. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5645.56s)]
*  He's incredible. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5647.2s)]
*  If you listen to that interview, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5648.04s)]
*  I think Wolfram does a great job of describing [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5648.88s)]
*  the difference between inferential models [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5650.76s)]
*  or statistical models and computational models. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5652.76s)]
*  Statistical models are where you take large data sets [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5657.16s)]
*  and you build statistical models that infer [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5660.04s)]
*  and predict things in the future [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5664.0s)]
*  or predict things that you ask it to predict [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5665.72s)]
*  from the data set that it's trained on. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5667.92s)]
*  And then it creates a statistical representation [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5669.96s)]
*  as a probability of being right or wrong [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5671.96s)]
*  in every prediction it makes, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5673.52s)]
*  and it creates a distribution of outputs from the model. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5675.04s)]
*  And you can train a model from nothing today [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5677.96s)]
*  using a bunch of tools that are open source [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5681.48s)]
*  and generally available and a bunch of great silicon [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5683.919999999999s)]
*  and all this amazing stuff that's now out in the world. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5685.679999999999s)]
*  But there's a bunch of things that you can't generate data [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5688.959999999999s)]
*  and you can't necessarily train models on, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5692.2s)]
*  and that requires computational models. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5694.4s)]
*  Models where you actually have to build some system [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5696.719999999999s)]
*  that creates a deterministic outcome. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5701.4s)]
*  And a deterministic means that it doesn't have [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5703.28s)]
*  a distribution of things that could happen. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5704.919999999999s)]
*  It has one thing, and it calculates it. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5706.28s)]
*  Like two plus four is six. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5709.04s)]
*  There isn't a probability distribution on it being six. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5711.2s)]
*  Two plus four is computable. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5713.64s)]
*  It is calculable. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5715.68s)]
*  It is six. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5716.5199999999995s)]
*  The great unlock that I think is ahead of us still, [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5718.48s)]
*  generally speaking with respect to large language models [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5723.0s)]
*  is the connection back to computational models, [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5726.04s)]
*  is the connection back to structured data [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5728.8s)]
*  where you can make requests and integrate structured data [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5731.28s)]
*  into the output, combined with inferential output, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5733.96s)]
*  and computational models where you can take the inference, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5737.52s)]
*  you can take the request, and figure out [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5740.8s)]
*  what computational models can I now run [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5743.080000000001s)]

*  talent, applied math, statistics, all the stuff [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5753.84s)]

*  in lots of different markets, [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5768.76s)]

*  or delighting some other customer base, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5788.0s)]
*  I'm willing to take that small bet on, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5789.04s)]
*  that 100K to 250K bet, [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5790.92s)]
*  because in the previous paradigm shifts, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5793.76s)]
*  or platform shifts, cloud computing, apps, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5796.64s)]
*  and before that, desktop computing and the web, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5799.88s)]
*  you saw people start tinkering with stuff, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5803.400000000001s)]
*  and whatever their first two ideas were are long forgotten, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5805.92s)]
*  because they figured something else out, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5809.2s)]
*  and I kind of feel like that's the stage we're in. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5811.0s)]
*  There were a lot of people who were playing with iPhones [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5813.6s)]
*  in the app store, and they made a calculator [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5815.400000000001s)]
*  or a flashlight that got built into the operating system [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5818.52s)]
*  as I think Freeberg is specifically pointing out. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5822.28s)]
*  You could just be part of the model, [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5824.4s)]
*  and your whole business is wiped out. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5825.5599999999995s)]
*  We have one company that's trying [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5827.28s)]
*  to make itineraries for travel, [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5828.5199999999995s)]
*  and I looked at what they're building, [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5830.88s)]
*  and then they're figuring out prompts, [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5833.32s)]
*  they're figuring out the interface, [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5835.5599999999995s)]
*  they're figuring out what people want, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5836.92s)]
*  and I did the same searches on ChatGPT4, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5838.88s)]
*  and I was like, it's not that much better, [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5840.84s)]
*  what you're doing, but it's better, [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5843.08s)]
*  and your ideas are better, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5845.32s)]
*  and so I think that the win the race, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5846.639999999999s)]
*  and they only have to please [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5848.28s)]
*  whatever number of users, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5850.04s)]
*  and this company could wind up being, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5852.2s)]
*  like I said before, a 20 person company [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5853.8s)]
*  that does 50 million in revenue, [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5855.36s)]
*  and I think that's gonna be a very interesting future, [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5857.36s)]
*  and it reminds me of the app economy. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5860.08s)]
*  There were a small number of apps, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5861.88s)]
*  things like DistroKid or Instagram, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5863.72s)]
*  where small teams built things that printed money [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5867.24s)]
*  and had incredibly high margins, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5869.72s)]
*  so I think that's part of the opportunity here. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5871.48s)]
*  I do agree with Chamath's point, [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5873.56s)]
*  data's the new oil. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5875.2s)]
*  Whatever data set you have that you have that's unique [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5877.04s)]
*  is incredibly powerful in terms of defensibility, [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5879.28s)]
*  and could help you to outpace one of the generic models. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5882.24s)]
*  This dude's been waiting. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5887.639999999999s)]

*  Finally, Jesus Christ. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5898.599999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure what the fuck these guys are doing. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5900.2s)]
*  So on the last one or two episodes, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5905.2s)]
*  I can't recall, you brought up this whole idea [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5907.56s)]
*  as how do we get non-US born American patriots [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5910.88s)]
*  run for president? [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5914.76s)]
*  So as the growth hacking drunken master, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5916.400000000001s)]
*  what do you recommend? [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5922.320000000001s)]

*  How do we have it pick up steam [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5924.280000000001s)]
*  and not have to wait 25 years or whatever? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5926.240000000001s)]
*  You know, we have to wait. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5928.68s)]
*  No, it can't happen in the next few years. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5929.52s)]
*  I do think there's a small probability [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5932.040000000001s)]
*  it could happen in 25 to 30 years, [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5933.64s)]
*  but like the problem is that the people that- [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5935.96s)]
*  Only J Cal can be president on this stage, by the way. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5942.8s)]
*  The three of us are foreign born. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5945.32s)]
*  That's how fucked up this is. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5946.16s)]
*  But I'll put you guys in my cabinet. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5947.68s)]
*  You've all got positions. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5949.24s)]
*  I think the how is that you have enough bottoms up [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5950.44s)]
*  citizen journalism and opinion formation [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5955.16s)]
*  that people can independently decide [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5960.24s)]
*  that on the margin, this is a good idea. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5962.88s)]
*  Like, look, I'm not interested in running for government, [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5966.4800000000005s)]
*  but if David were in charge of something very important, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5969.0s)]
*  treasury or state, I would have immense confidence. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5972.280000000001s)]
*  If Freeberg were in charge of something, [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5976.360000000001s)]
*  I would have immense confidence. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5977.76s)]
*  So the idea that guys like this- [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5979.56s)]
*  The idea that guys like this- [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5982.08s)]
*  Oh, cause I'm born here, so you don't have to say that. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5987.04s)]
*  Don't worry, you'll get the Department of Sanitation [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5989.68s)]
*  I'm definitely gonna win. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5991.88s)]

*  Great job, post master general. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=5994.56s)]

*  That's insane. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6008.240000000001s)]
*  So I think that if we're in the business [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6010.320000000001s)]
*  of actually deciding that you want the best people [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6012.4800000000005s)]
*  for this country on the court [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6014.72s)]

*  you don't tell John, you know, you were born in Greece, [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6020.8s)]
*  so chow chow, you don't get to play. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6023.96s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6025.5199999999995s)]
*  Put them on the court and let them win. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6028.16s)]
*  So I do think it takes 25 or 30 years though [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6030.24s)]
*  of us saying this because it has to be a groundswell [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6033.08s)]
*  of people that say, I just want to win [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6035.96s)]
*  because I'm seeing all these other countries [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6038.04s)]
*  starting to win more. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6039.5199999999995s)]

*  I do think it takes a generation. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6043.04s)]
*  I don't think it happens today. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6044.44s)]
*  All right guys, in a couple of hours, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPMNbMR1p70&t=6045.919999999999s)]
