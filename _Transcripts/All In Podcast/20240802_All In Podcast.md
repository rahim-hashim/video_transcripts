# Kamala surges, Trump at NABJ, recession fears, Middle East escalation, Ackman postpones IPO
**All In Podcast:** [August 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE)
*  How good do I look? I'm so sunkissed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=0.0s)]
*  How many buttons down are you? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2.32s)]
*  Oh my god, I have three buttons. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4.8s)]
*  Is there a button below that we can't see? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=10.72s)]
*  No pants. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=12.64s)]
*  There's no pants either? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=13.44s)]
*  Are you free buttoning and free balling it? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=17.68s)]
*  And it said we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=30.0s)]
*  Love you, S90. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=33.92s)]
*  Hey everybody, welcome back to the Allline Pod. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=38.32s)]
*  This week, our hostess with the mostest, Jcal is out with COVID, getting treated, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=41.28s)]
*  spending the day in bed. We wish him well. We wish him a speedy recovery. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  We are going to plow forward like all championship teams do. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  This week, I think we're going to kick it off with a conversation about the election update. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=57.68s)]
*  Obviously, Harris came out guns a blazing in the media. The accolades seem to be flying. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=63.28s)]
*  And the polling data is starting to become worrisome, it seems, for the Republicans. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=70.32s)]
*  Just this week, Nate Silver released his newest model update, the Silver Bulletin. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=76.24s)]
*  I think he's got it trademarked as nowadays. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=81.52s)]
*  And in the model, he tries to estimate what does the polling data show us with respect to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=85.28s)]
*  the Electoral College and the popular vote in the upcoming presidential election. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=90.0s)]
*  Harris currently has a 42.5% probability of winning the Electoral College. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=96.16s)]
*  Trump, 56.9%. Kennedy coming in at 0%. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=102.08s)]
*  On the popular vote, Harris has a 57.1% probability of winning the popular vote. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=107.12s)]
*  42.9% probability for Trump. I guess I'll start it off with David Sacks. Sacks, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=114.0s)]
*  given the momentum coming out of the gate since the announcement [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=121.04s)]
*  of Harris as the Democratic nominee and the three-sync polling data, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=124.8s)]
*  what's your read on the landscape today? What's your read on where we stand and what's ahead here? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=129.36s)]
*  And what do you take away from these polls? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=134.72s)]
*  Well, look, I think what happened is that Biden dropped out of the race. He abdicated. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=136.88s)]
*  Harris took over and it created a sense of euphoria on the part of the left because they [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=142.0s)]
*  thought they had a surefire loser with Biden and they were divided. And then once Harris replaced [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=146.96s)]
*  him, they thought, okay, now we got a shot and we can fully unify and get behind this new candidate. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=152.72s)]
*  So what you've seen is over the past couple of weeks, the mainstream media has gone all out [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=158.32s)]
*  on behalf of Kamala Harris. And yes, this has led to a rise in the polls. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=163.84s)]
*  But I think that the highs that Trump were at were always a little bit artificial in the sense [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=170.72s)]
*  that if the Democrats could field a candidate who could campaign, it was always going to be a close [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=176.16s)]
*  election. Biden was artificially depressed in the polling because he just couldn't campaign. He [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=181.68s)]
*  could barely read from a prompter. He couldn't do interviews. So I think you're seeing the race [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  normalizing. This is going to be a close one. It's going to be a nail-biter. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=192.24s)]
*  But I think the question about this honeymoon period that Harris has right now is whether [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  it's sustainable. I mean, she has not done any press interviews. She has not done any [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=203.84s)]
*  press conferences. She's not answered one question. She's not been asked one tough question by the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  media. She has only read from a teleprompter. She's only done scripted appearances. And yet, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=216.72s)]
*  at the same time, she's basically been changing all of her policy positions and running from every [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=225.68s)]
*  position she ever stood for. So for example, she said that she was in favor of single payer. Now, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=231.28s)]
*  she's against it. She said she was in favor of court packing. Now, she's against it. She said she [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=237.28s)]
*  was against fracking. Now, she's in favor of it. On the border, she said that we should consider [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=242.24s)]
*  abolishing ICE. Now, all of a sudden, she's in favor of more funding for border patrol. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=247.36s)]
*  On crime, she used to take kind of the BLM position that cops don't make us safer. To now, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  she's saying that she's a cop and prosecutor herself. She used to be in favor of federal [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  gun buybacks. Now, she's against them. It just goes on and on. I mean, in the 2020 riots, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=262.24s)]
*  she raised money for the legal defense of rioters. Now, she's distancing herself from those [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=267.6s)]
*  positions. My point is this, is that after spending really her whole career staking out positions on [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=272.64s)]
*  the far left, she has now dropped all of these positions for political expediency. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=277.84s)]
*  The question is, what does she stand for at all? Does she just kind of blow with the wind and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=284.56s)]
*  say whatever helps her win whatever the next election is? I mean, I think that's basically [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=289.28s)]
*  what's going on here. Normally, what happens is the press would ask you that question, but [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=294.08s)]
*  she's been getting a free pass because the mainstream media has basically been operating [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=300.4s)]
*  as a division of the DNC, and they're not holding her to account in any way. They're not requiring [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=303.92s)]
*  her to answer any questions. And as a result, yes, you're seeing this bounce in the polls. But [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=308.8s)]
*  I think the question is, can she sustain this for 100 days? Can she really get through the entire [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=316.24s)]
*  election without having gone through a primary, without ever having to explain her positions on [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=320.16s)]
*  issues? And she just does these short scripted appearances. I just think that at some point over [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=325.68s)]
*  the next 100 days, that approach is just going to fall apart. She's going to have to do a debate. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=330.4s)]
*  She's going to have to answer questions. At that point, I think the bloom will come off the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=335.12s)]
*  rose a little bit here, and you'll see the polls normalize. Do you think that JD Vance has negatively [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=339.76s)]
*  affected the interest in Trump? That there's a lot of media coverage about JD Vance being potentially [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=349.2s)]
*  the wrong pick for vice president and that he's creating more of a challenge for the president's [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  campaign than a boom? No, listen, anyone who Trump chose was going to be absolutely smeared by the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=360.24s)]
*  other side and by the media. If it had been Doug Burgum, there would have been nonstop coverage of [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=367.36s)]
*  the six week abortion bill that he signed. Right. You could go down the list. I mean, look, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=372.48s)]
*  what Democrats will say is we just want to see a moderate Republican. But when Mitt Romney ran, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=377.68s)]
*  they were calling him a fascist. So the reality is that the mainstream media and the DNC, but I [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=381.76s)]
*  repeat myself, are going to smear anyone who's picked. At the end of the day, I don't think [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=387.44s)]
*  that it matters. What matters is the top of the ticket. Jamof, what do you think about the Harris [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=392.64s)]
*  campaign, how it's going and the momentum that is being projected in the media and the polling data [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=397.6s)]
*  is clearly demonstrating an improvement over Biden's standings in the polls? I mean, I think we had a [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=402.72s)]
*  situation where one candidate was not real. And so Sachs is right that a lot of the polling up until [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=408.4s)]
*  basically last week is not really reliable. Now you have this snapback effect, which is more about [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=418.4s)]
*  a lot of people that were coming around to this idea of voting for Trump because Biden was such [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=427.28s)]
*  a bad option. Now flip flopping. And so I think that's what explains the snapback. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=434.16s)]
*  But Sachs is right. 100 days is a really long time. And what Nate Silver's poll essentially shows is [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=443.68s)]
*  if she wants to win, not the popular vote, because at this point now three or four elections in a [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=452.8s)]
*  row, that just doesn't matter anymore. If you want to win the electoral college and be the president, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=458.48s)]
*  you got to go and win five states. And in order to do that, you have to be very precise on about [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=463.92s)]
*  four or five specific issues. And in the absence of her defining herself on those four or five issues, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=469.6s)]
*  she's not going to win. She'll win the popular vote. But again, when people win the popular vote [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  and lose the electoral college, we've now gone through that enough times where that's just the [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=481.52000000000004s)]
*  complete inside of American electoral politics. So I think that the Trump campaign and the Harris [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=485.20000000000005s)]
*  campaign need to agree on some schedule of debates. I hope that they do two and ideally three, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=491.2s)]
*  and that they both get after it in front of each other so that those five states that are really [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=498.8s)]
*  going to decide this election has an opportunity to make a decision on behalf of the rest of the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=505.12s)]
*  country. Yeah, Nick, if you pull that chart back up again, based on Nate Silver's model of polls, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=510.0s)]
*  where he takes all the polling data that's been collected by different third parties, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=516.0s)]
*  he weights them based on the performance of those polls in terms of predictive power historically. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=520.4s)]
*  And he creates this kind of macro model. That's the Nate Silver approach here. He's estimating [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=525.84s)]
*  that within the 80% bound, every state on this list is up for grabs, as you can see, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=530.48s)]
*  with the gray lines shown there. There's a very slight margin on the average in Wisconsin for [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=536.48s)]
*  Trump, in Michigan for Harris, in Pennsylvania for Trump, in Nevada for Trump, in North Carolina for [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=543.12s)]
*  Trump, in Virginia for Harris, and so on. But each of those margins is so slim that there's still [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=549.76s)]
*  quite a lot of decision making ahead for voters. So pretty clearly on point that there's still [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=556.08s)]
*  very much an open election. I'll give you guys my read. I think that there's five camps of voters [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=563.6s)]
*  going into this when Biden was a candidate. The first is anti-Biden, anything but Biden. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=569.52s)]
*  The second is anything but Trump. The third is pro-Biden. The fourth is pro-Trump. And then the [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=575.9200000000001s)]
*  fifth is the other. And I think that that entire bucket of anything but Biden just became available [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=582.08s)]
*  once Biden dropped out of the race. And it was a pretty sizable bucket that there's a large number [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=589.12s)]
*  of voters out there that fell pretty strongly that Biden poses such a significant risk for [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=593.52s)]
*  leadership in this country because of the mental issues and the performance issues that we had seen [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=598.4000000000001s)]
*  that as much as people didn't love Trump, they were willing to vote for him because he's not Biden. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=604.16s)]
*  Now that camp has an option, and that option is Harris. So some percentage of that camp, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=609.92s)]
*  and I would say probably a super majority of that camp, is now switching into the Harris bucket. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=614.24s)]
*  The pro-Trump bucket doesn't move. The pro-Biden bucket probably doesn't move. It sticks with [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  Harris. And the anything but Trump bucket doesn't move. It sticks with Harris. So the fact that [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  there is probably such a sizable number of voters in the anything but Biden camp is what's probably [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=631.28s)]
*  helping Harris at this point and creates a bit of a handicap for Trump going into this last stretch [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=636.4s)]
*  of the campaign. That's my review because I know a lot of people with that point of view. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=642.16s)]
*  That's an interesting point of view. And let me just respond to that for a second. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=646.0s)]
*  So one of our critiques of Biden, not just in this election cycle, but probably going back a year, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=650.8s)]
*  is that Biden had become basically a figurehead president, almost a construct, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=656.4s)]
*  and he was fronting for a shadow cabinet or a group of powerful staffers who were really [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=661.6s)]
*  running the country, basically because of his cognitive decline. And we sort of joke that [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=666.48s)]
*  whoever the White House intern was who was running the social media accounts, or the staffer who was [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=671.68s)]
*  running the teleprompter was basically the president because they could dictate what Biden said. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  Now, I think the question to ask is, has anything changed? Kamala Harris refuses to do any interviews. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=682.4000000000001s)]
*  She doesn't want to do any unscripted appearances. She's abandoned all of her policy positions that [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=688.72s)]
*  have been longstanding and were the reason why she reigned for president in the first place in 2020. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=694.08s)]
*  So the question to ask is, do we still have a construct as the president? I mean, the Biden [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=699.2800000000001s)]
*  staffers who are running Biden are now just running Harris. We don't know what she stands for. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=704.72s)]
*  We don't have her appearing in unscripted, natural appearances. We don't have her being [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=710.88s)]
*  challenged by the press. She's not willing to do what Trump did. Trump just walked into the lion's [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=718.8s)]
*  den yet again at the NABJ. National Association of Black Journalists. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=724.8s)]
*  Right, exactly. So Trump walks into a very hostile interview at NABJ. Harris was supposed to come, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=730.0s)]
*  and she didn't come. She would have gotten a very softball interview. She's not even willing to do [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=736.0s)]
*  that. I think that in substantive terms, I don't think that much has changed this election. The [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=741.2s)]
*  Biden staff is still running for president. I mean, that's what you're voting for. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=745.6s)]
*  I would disagree on this because I think in the last two weeks, what I've seen is statements [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=748.72s)]
*  coming out of the Harris camp that clearly distinguish her and her campaign from Biden's [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=754.0s)]
*  policy positions and Biden's campaign rhetoric historically. Most particularly, Sacks is on [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=759.6s)]
*  Israel. When Netanyahu came to visit the United States, she put out a very pro-Israel statement [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  that we all know the Biden camp has largely avoided doing because of the concern over the [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=772.88s)]
*  pro-Palestinian rights movement's reaction to the Biden camp being pro-Israel. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=778.48s)]
*  And the Harris statement was pretty finely worded and pretty strongly worded that she is very much [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=784.24s)]
*  in favor of Israel defending itself. She acknowledged that there is a loss of Palestinian life that [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=789.36s)]
*  matters, and we need to acknowledge and address it. But she was very much in support of Israel, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=794.16s)]
*  which is not a position we've seen the Biden camp take. And I think that we're starting to see [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=798.64s)]
*  what is a little bit more of a fracturing between Harris being allowed to be free and being allowed [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=804.08s)]
*  to have an opinion outside of the party line dictated by the Biden camp. And I think we'll [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=809.2s)]
*  probably see more of that in the next couple of weeks. And we'll probably see her starting [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=814.5600000000001s)]
*  to be a little bit more refined in what differentiates her from Biden, because I do [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=818.56s)]
*  think that's what's going to allow her to win this election. And she's going to stand up and say, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=823.1999999999999s)]
*  here's why I am not Joe Biden, and here's what makes me different from that individual. I respect [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=826.4799999999999s)]
*  him. I love him. He helped me. But let me tell you why I'm different and why that should matter. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=830.64s)]
*  She snubbed Netanyahu, Freeberg. I don't know what you're talking about. She snubbed Netanyahu. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=835.52s)]
*  I think you're an example of the people that want to give her the benefit of the doubt. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=839.68s)]
*  OK. I think there's a large fraction of those people. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=843.92s)]
*  That's not true. No, that's not a fair way to characterize me at all. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=847.28s)]
*  I'm simply pointing out that she made a statement. I'm pointing out that she made a statement that's [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=850.88s)]
*  different than what Biden said. That's it. That's all I'm saying. Hold on a second. I think on Israel. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=854.72s)]
*  So first of all, she didn't write that statement. The staff did. OK. Now, what is the staff trying [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=858.9599999999999s)]
*  to accomplish on Israel? They actually have a genuine dilemma on the whole Israel-Palestine [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=863.28s)]
*  issue because the Democrat Party is very much split on this. The Democrat establishment is pro [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=868.0799999999999s)]
*  Israel, but the progressive base is very pro-Palestine. Even polling among youth [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=872.88s)]
*  shows significant support for Hamas even. A lot of these people are very much within the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=879.92s)]
*  hardcore left-wing base of the Democrat Party. So what the Biden administration has been doing, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=886.32s)]
*  and what I think Harris is continuing, is a process of talking out of both sides of their mouth. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=891.6s)]
*  Biden went to Israel, bear hug, BB, basically supported his policy, but then gave some lip [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=897.44s)]
*  service to the idea that he would limit the weapons that Israel is able to use. Harris puts [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=903.7600000000001s)]
*  out this very pro-Israel statement, but then snubs Netanyahu at that speech he gave before Congress. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=909.6800000000001s)]
*  So look, the Democrats are trying to have it both ways. They have a base that is fractured on this [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=915.6s)]
*  issue, and so they're trying to thread that needle. Now, you're right that let's just up, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=921.5200000000001s)]
*  blah, blah. Let's move off the Israel issue for a second. There's no question that Harris [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=926.48s)]
*  wants to run from her record as being Biden's vice president. There's a good reason for that. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=931.76s)]
*  The Biden-Harris administration is historically unpopular. What you have to ask, though, is whether [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=937.6800000000001s)]
*  it's credible. Harris suddenly is in favor of more money for border patrol. Why didn't she advocate [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=942.96s)]
*  for that when she was Biden's border czar? The media is fiercely scrubbing its websites to remove [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=948.88s)]
*  references. Hold on, they're removing historical references from during the Biden administration [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=954.56s)]
*  when she was openly called the border czar. They're trying to memory hole that. So look, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=959.76s)]
*  I have no doubt that the Harris campaign wants to drop every substantive policy position she's ever [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=964.16s)]
*  taken because they just want her to be a construct. They just want people to be excited because. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=970.4799999999999s)]
*  I do think that what you're saying is exactly what she needs to answer to in public in the next [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=976.7199999999999s)]
*  couple of weeks to earn credibility on what is she different from the Biden administration on in [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=981.36s)]
*  terms of policy and why did she not make that clear when she was in the Biden administration? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=987.44s)]
*  And she can say, I didn't agree with it, or she can say, I've changed my mind. And I think both [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=992.32s)]
*  of those might end up being where she needs to go to. But you're right. She does need to answer to [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=997.44s)]
*  that. I don't think it's clear she has to do any of that. You think she can just hide out and [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1001.44s)]
*  coast? No, right now, right now, the calculation is to get as many people to basically move into the [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1005.8399999999999s)]
*  not Trump voting stance. Right. They're giving as much time as possible to measure that and see if [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1014.4799999999999s)]
*  it's a winning strategy. But again, and I think we just talked about this, mathematically, it can win [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1021.12s)]
*  the popular vote, but it will not win the electoral college. So she is going to have to appear and be [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1027.2s)]
*  in a position where she's confronted on about four or five key issues. And that's where this [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1033.36s)]
*  presidency is going to get decided. Four or five issues in four or five states, and we'll all know [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1038.4799999999998s)]
*  where she's standing on the border, on the economy. By the way, the problem is, and if you look at [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1043.84s)]
*  what's happening now, we are in a recessionary stance. There's going to be a lot of ink that [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1048.7199999999998s)]
*  gets spilled starting in September on the fact that X of a handful of companies were basically [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1055.1999999999998s)]
*  in a recession. So that's going to have to get put on the feet of the sitting president and the [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1059.68s)]
*  sitting vice president. So there's a whole set of complicated issues. I think it's smart, actually, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1064.64s)]
*  for her to strategically kind of stay quiet right now, and just kind of see all the goodwill that's [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1070.3200000000002s)]
*  pent up to the not Trump candidate is going to flow her way. Right. The problem is that that's [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1077.28s)]
*  not enough to sustain yourself for 100 days. And so she's just going to have to take a point of view. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1083.44s)]
*  Well, it might be if the press lesser get away with it. No, because I think David, I think you're [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1089.68s)]
*  right. Because when when you go into a debate, or when you go into these places, people will want to [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1093.8400000000001s)]
*  know the answers to these questions. And if the media tries to memory hold this thing, I think the [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1098.96s)]
*  the thing that they most don't want, which is another Trump victory will actually happen because [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1105.68s)]
*  of it. Because people will come in this kind of like ambivalent group of folks that are or [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1111.44s)]
*  independent group of folks that are looking for very clear point of view on four or five issues, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1117.36s)]
*  maybe we'll come to a rally. And instead of that, they'll hear Megan the stallion, and they'll [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1122.8s)]
*  wonder to themselves, well, this is not what I came for. I came to know where you stand on these [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1127.4399999999998s)]
*  four or five issues. So the media actually, in order to give her the best chance of getting elected, [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1131.76s)]
*  and this is counterintuitive to them, which is why they probably won't do it, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1137.28s)]
*  they'll have to confront her on these issues. Yeah, I think that's fair. And that's why I invite [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1140.8s)]
*  Vice President Harrison to the all in podcast to join us for conversation. I think we will all [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1145.92s)]
*  really enjoy that. And just to declare my position, I am in Camp Five, the other camp, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1150.4s)]
*  I am not pro or anti either of these candidates, I obviously have issues that I think are [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1155.76s)]
*  far more existential to the longevity of the United States and the republic that need to be [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1160.88s)]
*  addressed that don't seem to be a priority for either candidate or either party, as I've mentioned [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1166.24s)]
*  many times on the show, that's where I stand. Let's move on. Sax, I just want to ask, do you [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1169.92s)]
*  think that Trump is at risk of shooting himself in the foot by being too public, too open and too [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1175.6s)]
*  engaging? If we take a look at what happened this week, the National Association of Black Journalists [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1180.9599999999998s)]
*  had a convention on Wednesday, it said interview requests to both President Trump and Vice President [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1185.28s)]
*  Harris and Trump accepted and went in person. Harris said she couldn't do it in person or via [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1189.52s)]
*  zoom. And according to the National Association of Black Journalists, Harris is in talks to do a Q&A [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1193.84s)]
*  session with them at some point in September, there were two moments that are making a lot of [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1199.6s)]
*  news. One was the first question. Nick, can you play this where ABC's Rachel Scott went after Trump? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1202.64s)]
*  A lot of people did not think it was appropriate for you to be here today. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1209.0400000000002s)]
*  You have pushed false claims about some of your rivals, from Nikki Haley to former president [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1213.68s)]
*  Barack Obama saying that they were not born in the United States, which is not true. You have [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1218.72s)]
*  told for Congresswoman Wynne of color, who were American citizens to go back to where they came [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1223.76s)]
*  from. You have used words like animal and rabbit to describe black district attorneys. You have [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1228.16s)]
*  attacked black journalists calling them a loser saying the questions that they ask are quote, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1234.48s)]
*  stupid and racist. You have had dinner with a white supremacist at your Mar-a-Lago resort. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1239.0400000000002s)]
*  So my question, sir, now that you are asking black supporters to vote for you, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1244.4s)]
*  why should black voters trust you after you have used language like that? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1250.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, I don't think I've ever been asked a question [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1254.32s)]
*  so in such a horrible manner. First question. You don't even say hello, how are you? Are you [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1258.1599999999999s)]
*  with ABC? Because I think they're a fake news network, a terrible network. And I think it's [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1266.0s)]
*  disgraceful that I came here in good spirit. I love the black population of this country. I've [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1273.36s)]
*  done so much for the black population of this country, including employment, including [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1280.96s)]
*  opportunity zones with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, which is one of the greatest programs [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1288.8s)]
*  ever for black workers and black entrepreneurs. I've done so much and you know, and I say this, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1294.48s)]
*  historically black colleges and universities were out of money. They were stone cold broke [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1302.48s)]
*  and I saved them and I gave them long term financing and nobody else was doing it. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1308.08s)]
*  I think it's a very rude introduction. I don't know exactly why you would do something like that. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1313.6799999999998s)]
*  And let me go a step further. I was invited here and I was told my opponent, whether it was Biden [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1319.84s)]
*  or Kamala, I was told my opponent was going to be here. It turned out my opponent isn't here. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1325.4399999999998s)]
*  You invited me under false pretense and then you said you can't do it with Zoom. Well, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1332.16s)]
*  you know, where's Zoom? She's going to do it with Zoom and she's not coming. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1338.5600000000002s)]
*  And then you were half an hour late. Just so we understand, I have too much respect for you to [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1342.0s)]
*  be late. They couldn't get their equipment working or something was wrong. I think it's a very nasty [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1345.92s)]
*  question. I have answered the question. Sax, is he shooting himself in the foot by agreeing to show [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1351.44s)]
*  up? He showed up to the Bitcoin conference, which obviously went phenomenally well. But Sax, is he [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1356.72s)]
*  shooting himself in the foot by being too open and engaging too much? And should he lay low? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1361.04s)]
*  No. I mean, look, what kind of president do you want? I mean, I want the president who is fearless [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1366.0s)]
*  and willing to walk into the lion's den over and over again and answer tough questions. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1371.76s)]
*  What you saw in that soundbite here is that Rachel Scott, the interviewer, that whatever she was [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1375.84s)]
*  doing is not journalism. This is supposed to be a journalism association. She turned that interview [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1379.92s)]
*  into an ambush. It was hostile what she did and right out of the gate. I mean, the first question [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1384.56s)]
*  she's attacking him and he pushed back on it. I mean, I think you saw him push back on the media [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1390.08s)]
*  in a way that only Trump can do. Now, you also heard there, I think, a really key point that [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1395.1999999999998s)]
*  Harris basically passed on the option to attend when she was originally supposed to. That would [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1401.04s)]
*  have been a softball interview for her, but she is not willing to do any kind of interview right now. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1406.8799999999999s)]
*  No questions, no unscripted appearances. She just wants to read from a teleprompter that rally she [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1411.52s)]
*  did in Atlanta that had Megan Thee Stallion perform. So, it's a free concert that drew out [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1417.92s)]
*  a huge number of people. Then Harris spoke for 17 minutes and people were leaving five minutes in [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1424.5600000000002s)]
*  because they're just there for the concert. I guess the question that people need to ask, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1428.96s)]
*  I understand why this is strategic for her. I mean, obviously it's better for you if you don't [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1432.88s)]
*  have to take any positions whatsoever and you can just abandon all of your previous positions [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1437.52s)]
*  without any explanation whatsoever and the media gives you a free pass on that. I can understand [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1443.28s)]
*  why that's strategic, but I think that voters need to ask the question, who do you want representing [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1447.44s)]
*  the United States right now in a world that's on fire? Who do you want to stand up to Putin or Xi [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1452.8s)]
*  or make peace with them? Who do you want to stand up to or be allies with Netanyahu, for example? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1458.88s)]
*  The United States right now is in a very difficult situation. We can't have a teleprompter [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1465.68s)]
*  president. We need a strong president. I appreciate the fact that Trump is willing to take on all [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1469.76s)]
*  challengers. I just think it's manifestly clear that these are the qualities and traits you want [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1474.96s)]
*  in a president of the United States. Okay, so your opinion is Trump needs to continue to engage [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1479.44s)]
*  openly and publicly. It shows strength and it shows a capacity to deal with adversity and conflict. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1485.1200000000001s)]
*  Point taken. So let's pull up the next clip where Scott then asked Trump if Harris was a DEI candidate [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1491.8400000000001s)]
*  and here's his answer. I've known her a long time indirectly, not directly very much. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1498.4s)]
*  And she was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1505.04s)]
*  was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black and now she wants to be [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1512.08s)]
*  known as black. So I don't know, is she Indian or is she black? She is always identified as a black [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1517.04s)]
*  woman. I respect either one. I respect either one, but she obviously doesn't because she was Indian all [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1522.08s)]
*  the way and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went, she became a black person. Just to be [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1528.24s)]
*  clear, sir, do you believe that she is? I think somebody should look into that too when you ask [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1533.44s)]
*  a continue in a very hostile, nasty tone. Timoth, let me ask for your response. Did Trump shoot [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1537.6000000000001s)]
*  himself in the foot with that comment? And maybe you can give us your read on how he's doing with [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1543.2s)]
*  respect to this, you know, active engagement with obviously adverse, let's call them, you know, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1548.56s)]
*  journalists and interviews and forums. Well, I'd love to hear from the Caucasians. What do you guys [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1554.3200000000002s)]
*  think about that? Yeah, I'm not talking about the answer itself. I'm talking more about Trump [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1559.04s)]
*  getting out there and like engaging in this way. Yeah, here's what I will say. I think that [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1563.2s)]
*  from now until the end of time, with [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1570.24s)]
*  social media tools, replacing traditional media, and then with AI tools that are going to create [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1576.48s)]
*  enormous amounts of very sophisticated misinformation and disinformation, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1587.12s)]
*  I think the only strategy for politicians from here on out is to leave zero ambiguity [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1592.4799999999998s)]
*  between what you think and what you say. And so without judging the quality of the answer, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1598.08s)]
*  I think the thing that is going to be the most critical for people is to know that the person [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1606.08s)]
*  that you're voting for is in charge. And you get a great chance to vote this person up or down. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1612.4s)]
*  And the more content that that person puts out directly, the less likely it is that this [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1618.0800000000002s)]
*  ambiguity exists that can then get exploited, whether it's by internal people inside of a [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1622.72s)]
*  country or whether it's foreign adversaries. And so my perspective is it's pretty fearless [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1628.0s)]
*  of somebody to just constantly say what they think. And again, I'll just go back to where I [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1635.68s)]
*  what I said before, with respect to the Harris campaign. I think that Americans were smart [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1642.48s)]
*  enough and I think you did a good job of dissecting the electorate into five groups. Americans were [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1648.96s)]
*  smart enough to basically say never Biden because of the risk it represented to not know what one [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1654.4s)]
*  was voting for, irrespective of whatever your historic allegiances were. I think they're smart [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1660.16s)]
*  enough now to demand answers to the four or five questions that really matter. And I think if Paris [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1665.36s)]
*  wants to really win this, and give it a legitimate shot, she's going to have to take a point of view [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1669.9199999999998s)]
*  on these five things. And she's going to have to step into the lion's den and be asked very tough [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1676.0s)]
*  questions by a lot of different people. And she's going to have to leave no ambiguity that can be [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1682.24s)]
*  then exploited by misinformation and disinformation between now and the election. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1687.76s)]
*  So, you know, that's honestly my reaction. Zach's final word. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1691.92s)]
*  Yeah, look, I would say that in that clip and other clips from that event, I think you should [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1695.28s)]
*  pay a lot of attention to the audience's reaction. Because what do they do in that moment when Trump [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1700.3200000000002s)]
*  was supposedly committing a faux pas or getting into dangerous territory, they laugh. You know, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1705.76s)]
*  when Mitt Romney spoke to this group a number of years ago, when he was running for president, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1711.6000000000001s)]
*  he got booed. Trump never got booed. He got a lot of laughter. There was a lot of appreciation. Why? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1715.3600000000001s)]
*  Because Trump is always authentic. He's always who he is. Whereas Mitt Romney always appears to be [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1720.32s)]
*  scripted and frankly sort of patronizing. So I think the audience appreciated Trump for who he [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1725.4399999999998s)]
*  is. I think that when Trump goes into these areas, there's always a grain of truth to what he's saying. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1731.52s)]
*  I think that Harris has leaned into different parts of our heritage for different audiences. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1738.1599999999999s)]
*  But I do think that this is ground he should get off of. And I think a much better [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1744.32s)]
*  line of attack is to talk about the fact that she has dropped all of her left-wing policy positions [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1749.6s)]
*  and refuses to answer questions or do unscripted appearances without having a teleprompter in [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1755.84s)]
*  front of her. I think that's a much better line of attack. And I think that's what the campaign will [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1761.76s)]
*  be about from here. I don't think we want this campaign to be about identity. I do think that the [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1766.1599999999999s)]
*  rise of the authentic politician, the rise of the authentic CEO, typically founder, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1773.3600000000001s)]
*  the rise of the authentic celebrity is definitely the trend that we're seeing, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1780.64s)]
*  which is that authenticity counts for more than anything, regardless of one's position. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1785.52s)]
*  And obviously having trust in the individual is rooted in the authentic capacity of the individual [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1789.1200000000001s)]
*  rather than the teleprompter CEO or the teleprompter politician or the teleprompter [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1797.28s)]
*  or buttoned up or image managed celebrity. And that's definitely been a trend that's been [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1803.12s)]
*  building over the last 10 years, culminating in a lot of these changes that we're now seeing. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1808.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, just think about this thing about what's going to happen over the next four years [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1814.32s)]
*  if Harris is elected. I mean, you're going to have a prompter president. I mean, she's just [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1817.12s)]
*  never going to be off prompter. It's going to be like Biden. Biden at least tried to go off [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1821.2s)]
*  prompter. Whenever he did, it was a disaster. But at least he tried. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1825.36s)]
*  This is one of the criticisms of a lot of hired large enterprise CEOs is that they come in, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1828.9599999999998s)]
*  they have all their words written for them by our media team. They have all of their communication [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1835.6799999999998s)]
*  scripted, managed. Every press interview is with the right journalists, set in the right way. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1841.6s)]
*  And the CEOs that seem to build the greatest value are those who are typically founders [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1846.4799999999998s)]
*  because they're willing and able to be authentic because they weren't hired by the board. It's [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1853.04s)]
*  their business that they built. And so they're willing to be authentic. And the CEOs who operate [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1857.12s)]
*  at scale with authenticity build the greatest market value. I agree with you that whether you're [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1862.08s)]
*  a CEO or you're a politician, authenticity counts. But I think this election is going to be a test [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1866.96s)]
*  of what people want in their president. I mean, do you think the president needs to be a chief [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1872.32s)]
*  executive who at some level is calling the shots? Or do you think it's good enough for the president [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1877.68s)]
*  and the presidency to essentially be a construct and to be a manifestation of the staff, right? [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1882.96s)]
*  I think voters look at policy sacks and they look at character. And with respect to character, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1889.52s)]
*  there's a certain value that they ascribe to this authenticity component, which is typically lacking [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1895.8400000000001s)]
*  in most politicians. And Trump delivers that authentic component in how he talks and how he's [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1900.88s)]
*  off the cuff and so on. He's got other character issues, which I think hurt him. And on the policy [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1907.3600000000001s)]
*  people really kind of look at those objectively, those points. What's your policy? And do I trust [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1912.8000000000002s)]
*  you as your character? Right. But see, I think it's more than that because I think any large [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1917.6000000000001s)]
*  organization needs a chief executive. What happens when you don't have a chief executive or you don't [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1922.24s)]
*  have a strong chief executive? You get drift. The organization strategically drifts. 100%. Yeah, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1926.96s)]
*  it gets driven from the bottom instead of from the top. Yeah. The decisions that get made are [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1932.4s)]
*  the result of bureaucracy and fighting staffers. Exactly. You need someone to control that. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1935.68s)]
*  And I think it's really interesting that when Biden was still the candidate, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1941.68s)]
*  but everyone could tell that he was sort of impaired, that the arguments you started hearing [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1945.68s)]
*  from Democrat partisans and the media is that, well, you're voting for a team. You're not just [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1949.92s)]
*  voting for a president, right? You're voting for a shadow cabinet. Exactly the thing that we [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1955.28s)]
*  criticized on this pod for the last year. My point is that you're still voting for a shadow cabinet. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1958.8s)]
*  Unless Harris is willing to get out there and answer questions and be unscripted, you're just [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1963.44s)]
*  voting for a staff. And I don't think that's good enough. I don't think when we're in a world [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1968.32s)]
*  where we're in a proxy war with Russia and we could be in a war with China and we have these [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1972.96s)]
*  problems in the Middle East, I want a decider. I want to know that the buck stops here, not the [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1979.04s)]
*  buck stops wherever. Let's shift topics. I'd like to talk about what's been, I think, a lot of [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1985.84s)]
*  chatter amongst friends of ours who are active in the market that at a policy meeting on Wednesday, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1992.88s)]
*  the Fed held rates steady. Jerome Powell said, quote, a reduction in our policy rate could be [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=1999.8400000000001s)]
*  on the table in September if inflation continues to fall. He said, we're getting closer to the [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2004.5600000000002s)]
*  point at which it'll be appropriate to reduce our policy rate, but we're not quite at that point. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2009.52s)]
*  The next Fed meeting where this rate cut could happen is September 17th and 18th. And if you [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2016.24s)]
*  look at the futures markets today, the market is now estimating a 20% probability of a 50-bit rate [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2022.5600000000002s)]
*  cut in the September meeting, 80% probability of a 25-bit rate cut, and basically no probability [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2030.24s)]
*  of no rate cut anymore in September. Chamath, is that your read on where we're at? And [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2040.0800000000002s)]
*  is the Fed appropriately reading the economic tea leaves, given the recessionary indicators [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2045.76s)]
*  that you just mentioned earlier? And what else we're seeing that the Fed's mandate, obviously, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2052.0s)]
*  is meant to support both the monetary policy, but also employment in this country? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2058.08s)]
*  I think we're in a recession. And I think the problem with a recession is even as inflation [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2063.2s)]
*  diminishes, if your purchasing power is shrinking faster than prices fall, it still feels like [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2069.68s)]
*  prices are going up. I don't know if you guys have been reading the Wall Street Journal, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2075.6s)]
*  but the last couple of days, they've been doing a whole series on people that have been left behind [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2078.16s)]
*  by inflation. And I was really surprised as I read those articles, just the sheer quantity [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2082.64s)]
*  of impact in terms of the number of people it's touching independent of salary. And so [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2090.48s)]
*  my takeaway just reinforced the fact that we've looked past the problem because of the stock [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2096.4s)]
*  market going up for the last few quarters because of seven companies. And now that people are [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2105.28s)]
*  sobering up to the reality that even they don't have an answer for all the money they're spending, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2112.1600000000003s)]
*  the stock market's down next to those seven businesses. And I think that you're going to [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2118.1600000000003s)]
*  start to see some real pain in the fall. So Jerome Powell is probably going to cut 25. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2122.0s)]
*  And I think that if they get to him, he'll try to cut 50. But the problem is it won't solve the [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2127.6800000000003s)]
*  problem. And I think if this is again, where Kamala Harris has to be, she's going to have to [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2132.64s)]
*  make a very difficult calculation here, which is she's going to have to throw Joe Biden and the [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2138.08s)]
*  economic team in the White House under the bus here and say that was them. Yes, they screwed it [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2142.4s)]
*  up. It was against my wishes. And here's my vision for how we fix this, because otherwise, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2147.44s)]
*  the Republicans will be all over it. And I think if you have a bad economy, like what it looks like [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2152.56s)]
*  going into November, it's going to be very difficult for the Democrats to win the White House. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2156.88s)]
*  Nat Sinclair Well, without bringing it back to politics, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2162.56s)]
*  Sachs, economy, good or bad? And is Jerome Powell going to cut rates 25 bits, 50 bits? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2164.8s)]
*  Do you agree with what the market's forecasting? [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2169.44s)]
*  I guess what I would say about the economy is that in nominal terms, we're not in a recession [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2171.2s)]
*  according to the data that's come out. The Q2 GDP was roughly 2% GDP growth. However, I think there's [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2178.4s)]
*  a couple of problems. One is that what we've seen over the past year or so is that the economic data [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2184.88s)]
*  that comes out keeps getting re-forecast down. So they put out a provisional number or an estimate. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2190.7200000000003s)]
*  And then when they finalize the number three months or six months later, it always seems to [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2196.64s)]
*  go in one direction. We've seen this over and over again with new jobs being re-forecast down. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2201.68s)]
*  And we saw this with the Q1 GDP, where initially they were reporting, I think it was like a 1.8% [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2208.0s)]
*  number, and then it got restated down to 1.3%. So the Q2 GDP number was around 2%. It was good. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2213.7599999999998s)]
*  But again, it's a provisional number. And let's see where it actually ends up. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2219.52s)]
*  The bigger problem is government spending. The deficit is running at 6% of GDP, whereas economic [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2223.36s)]
*  growth is at, let's call it charitably 2%. Well, government spending is included in GDP. So if you [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2230.2400000000002s)]
*  were to balance the budget, let's say that you were to make government live within its means and [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2239.28s)]
*  not have a deficit, we would have negative 4% GDP growth. So the only reason why we're in positive [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2245.2000000000003s)]
*  GDP growth territory is because of massive government spending that we know is not [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2253.04s)]
*  sustainable. And at some point, the bill is going to come due for that. So I have to say that [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2258.48s)]
*  you asked me, is this a good economy? I mean, it's not the worst, but there's definitely [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2267.36s)]
*  unsustainable things propping it up. And I do think that the bill will come due at some point [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2272.72s)]
*  for this. It's not just fully supported. It's overly supported by the federal government in [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2278.0s)]
*  the United States. And I mentioned this last week, federal government spending is over 2x the sum of [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2283.04s)]
*  all state spending, federal government spending into next year with the Biden budget proposal, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2288.64s)]
*  $7.3 trillion. That's like 30% of GDP. And I think you guys may remember this analysis I pulled [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2293.76s)]
*  together a couple months ago, where I estimate something close to 30% of US employment is [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2300.88s)]
*  either direct government employment, or indirect government employment through government payments [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2308.72s)]
*  to third parties that are employing those individuals. So the government is becoming [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2314.32s)]
*  an integral part of maintaining the flow of dollars in the economy, because they are such [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2319.84s)]
*  an integral buyer and seller within the economy and an integral employer within the economy. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2326.24s)]
*  And so to reverse that trend is what I worry about more than anything, as I've shared [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2330.88s)]
*  many times, which is why I question whether either political candidate actually solves this [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2334.88s)]
*  problem for us. And we're almost like, you know, arguing over which marbles I get while the Titanic [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2338.8s)]
*  is sinking, that there is a real fundamental issue with how this economy is structured. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2343.2000000000003s)]
*  I will tell you anecdotally, I have a lot of conversations with folks that work [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2348.1600000000003s)]
*  in the agriculture industry and the food industry, in the industrial industry, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2351.76s)]
*  many of these industries that have a very different capital flow cycle than we all deal [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2356.0s)]
*  with typically in Silicon Valley and software. And many of them are struggling. I mean, these [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2360.56s)]
*  are businesses where some folks have told me orders completely fell off a cliff in capital [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2364.64s)]
*  equipment, that some small business owners that sell whatever piece of equipment you want to come [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2368.72s)]
*  up with, they are not getting orders, there's no revenue. There are massive oversupply and [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2373.2s)]
*  under purchasing happening in the food and ag markets. And yet folks are still trying to push [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2379.44s)]
*  up prices in order to make the debt payments that they have to make on their high interest debt now. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2383.68s)]
*  And that creates a crippling condition for them. Across the economy, I think there's the haves and [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2388.24s)]
*  have nots, as is indicated in this article that was just pulled up, where there are some parts of [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2392.8s)]
*  the economy where you have low debt, high margin businesses that can continue to scale and continue [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2397.76s)]
*  to raise pricing, have a lot of elasticity in pricing. And then there are the others [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2403.2000000000003s)]
*  that operate on 1% interest rate changes drive their profit or loss for the year [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2408.6400000000003s)]
*  in a pretty meaningful way. And that's the part of the economy that's really suffering. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2415.1200000000003s)]
*  And unfortunately, the action that will be taken to resolve this isn't necessarily a free market [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2419.2s)]
*  action. It's going to end up being some sort of government intervention, which furthers the [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2424.24s)]
*  government's involvement in the economy and furthers the tentacles that make it much harder to [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2428.48s)]
*  ultimately pull out of this spiral in this problem. That's my rant on this whole point. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2432.72s)]
*  But, yeah, no, I agree with that. I agree with all that. I've seen some reports that a crazy [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2436.72s)]
*  percentage of the job creation over the past year has have been government jobs. All of it, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2441.8399999999997s)]
*  more than 100%. So basically, there has been a net loss in private market jobs, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2447.6s)]
*  net of the effect of government employment or government spending on companies that then use [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2452.56s)]
*  those dollars to go hire people. Let's talk about the impact on markets. So, as a result of this [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2456.7999999999997s)]
*  rate cut announcement or this rate cut indication, markets have rallied a little bit. But to Chamath's [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2462.24s)]
*  point, there are definitely the haves and the have-nots. AMD beat. They were up 4% after hours on [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2468.16s)]
*  improved AI chip sales. Their revenue was $5.8 billion, up 9% year over year. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2475.8399999999997s)]

*  both said that there's increased AI demand and they're going to continue to build out capacity. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2490.08s)]
*  So Chamath, I know you've talked a lot about this in the past. Maybe you can give us your read [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2496.24s)]
*  on the comments that were made this week. You've historically said that a lot of this build out [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2500.16s)]
*  is well ahead and there's no real ROI yet. But clearly some of the buyers of this capital [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2504.48s)]
*  equipment are saying, hey, there is ROI. We're going to continue to build aggressively. So maybe [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2509.36s)]
*  you can share a little bit on is anything different or we just kind of seeing folks justify with the [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2513.84s)]
*  decision statement? I mean, sadly, this is another case of sell the news. These things rallied [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2518.4s)]
*  phantom in the after hours. And if you look at them, they've all just given back every dollar of gains. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2525.68s)]
*  So I think that people know that we're sort of at the tail end of the hype cycle in AI. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2530.32s)]
*  And every time these things spike, people take an opportunity to just massively sell. I mean, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2540.48s)]
*  NVIDIA has turned over 308 million shares today. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2546.88s)]
*  That's crazy. It's literally trading like a penny stock. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2550.8s)]
*  It's going straight down like a lead balloon. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2555.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2558.4s)]
*  Meta rallied. They've basically given up all of their gains. It's gone kind of straight down [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2559.28s)]
*  today. But the point isn't that these companies are going to zero. That's not the case. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2564.8s)]
*  It's just the point is that right now people are optimizing. They're selling every chance they get [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2568.96s)]
*  to kind of book the profits. And I think that that's fair because at some point, nobody knows [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2573.28s)]
*  when all of this phantom money is going to show up. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2579.52s)]
*  Right. So this is independent of what we would call the economy independent of [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2582.32s)]
*  the recessionary conversation and the rate conversation. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2586.48s)]
*  The problem? [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2588.72s)]
*  Look, I mean, I'm in the middle of this right now with 80-90. It's been one of the joys of my [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2590.0s)]
*  career to actually start a company in the middle of what I think is the most important wave that [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2594.4s)]
*  I've ever seen professionally since social networking. And I jumped into the middle of [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2600.08s)]
*  that wave and I kind of tried to ride the best wave I could there. I'm doing it here. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2605.2s)]
*  But my honest takeaway after being in this thing now for, you know, seven months intensely, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2610.24s)]
*  and I'll be into it for as many years as it takes to build a successful company, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2618.3999999999996s)]
*  is that AI is massively deflationary. It takes not that much money. And the results are [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2622.56s)]
*  really meaningful in terms of the amount of efficiency that you can capture and the costs [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2632.0s)]
*  that you can save. And the right business people, i.e. startups that are starting from scratch, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2636.64s)]
*  like myself and my co-founders at 80-90, we will pass that on to our customers because it allows us [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2642.4s)]
*  to differentially price versus incumbent solutions. And so I don't see a path where all of a sudden, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2648.72s)]
*  a multiple of the money that's been spent shows up. I don't see it. I do see a path where [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2656.16s)]
*  companies find tremendous. Like, think about it this way. If you looked in the 1980s and said, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2663.2s)]
*  what is the most profitable operational company that existed in the 80s? I don't know what that [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2669.9199999999996s)]
*  company was, but I suspect that their EBITDA margins were roughly in the 30 or 40% range. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2675.68s)]
*  And it was probably incredible. If you fast forward now 40 years, the most efficient company is [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2681.2s)]
*  probably sort of 50 or 60% EBITDA margins. The reality is that the best AI-enabled [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2688.0s)]
*  company will probably have margins that are 70 and 80% in the next 15 or 20 years. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2696.0s)]
*  Now, that's an incredible thing. That's a big prediction. But that will again spur [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2701.28s)]
*  the principle law of capitalism that everybody keeps forgetting, which is you compete out excess [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2706.48s)]
*  return. And so while you will have many companies that have 60 plus percent operating margins, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2712.0s)]
*  they'll be in much smaller markets. And there'll be thousands and thousands and thousands of them. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2718.64s)]
*  So I suspect what happens is that the overall market grows, but the number of companies grows [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2723.68s)]
*  by an even larger order of magnitude. And in all of that, the reality is that it's going to be very [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2729.36s)]
*  hard for these big folks to sort of see this value capture chip that makes any of this investment [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2735.44s)]
*  worthwhile. So I think that you're going to have to have some sort of reset in terms of the capex [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2740.16s)]
*  that's happened here. I want to switch gears yet again and talk about the assassination of Ismail [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2745.7599999999998s)]
*  Haniyeh. I hope I pronounced that right. Haniyeh. He was killed by a bomb while staying in a guest [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2751.92s)]
*  house in Tehran, according to the New York Times. Earlier reports indicated that he was in fact [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2758.3199999999997s)]
*  killed by a missile strike from Israel. But just this morning, the New York Times reported that [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2763.6s)]
*  the guest house where he stayed is run and protected by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2769.04s)]
*  and is part of a large compound known as Neshat in an upscale neighborhood of northern Tehran. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2774.32s)]
*  And the article in the New York Times goes on to report that according to several Middle Eastern [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2780.8s)]
*  sources, a bomb, a remotely detonated bomb was actually planted in this guest house over two [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2786.88s)]
*  months ago in anticipation of the Hamas leader's stay in this guest house. And it was then set off [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2794.24s)]
*  once he actually stayed in the guest house. This obviously represents kind of an incredible feat [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2801.8399999999997s)]
*  in operational capacity and intelligence. I think we've known and talked a lot about, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2807.7599999999998s)]
*  and the media is kind of covered quite a bit about the capacity of Ismail's side. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2812.64s)]
*  But I just want to kind of get your guys' reaction to this. I think that there's a bigger [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2816.7999999999997s)]
*  important story here about the strength of Israel's intelligence and military capacity in the region [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2821.04s)]
*  and what that could mean for their posturing and their demands and their activity in the region [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2827.28s)]
*  in the months and years ahead, particularly with Netanyahu still in charge. So, Sax, maybe you can [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2832.88s)]
*  kick us off with your thoughts on this article and Mossad's role in the assassination of this Hamas [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2837.84s)]
*  leader. Well, there's no question that the Mossad established or reestablished its reputation for [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2843.84s)]
*  extreme competence here, being able to infiltrate Iran in order to assassinate the top political [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2850.0s)]
*  leader of Hamas while Haniyeh was a guest of Iran. I mean, that's deeply humiliating to Iran. I think [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2856.0s)]
*  he was there, Haniyeh was, for the swearing in of the new president of Iran. So for them to be able [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2863.76s)]
*  to target him while he was there and step the bomb months in advance, I mean, that shows [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2870.08s)]
*  extraordinary planning and intelligence and a huge failure on the part of Iran. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2876.32s)]
*  I think in terms of the larger significance of this, in the wake of October 7th on this pod, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2882.0800000000004s)]
*  I said that I hope that Israel did not go off half-cocked responding the way that the United [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2889.28s)]
*  States did after 9-11. And when they started bombing Gaza, I said, this is going to backfire. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2896.4s)]
*  And, you know, boy, was that an understatement in terms of the reaction of world opinion. I mean, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2902.0s)]
*  Israel went into Gaza, basically leveled the place, and has alienated practically the entire world. The [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2907.7599999999998s)]
*  only country that's solidly with Israel anymore is the United States. And even within the United [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2913.3599999999997s)]
*  States, roughly half the people are now against Israel. And I think what I said at the time was [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2917.52s)]
*  that Israel could pursue or should pursue a more targeted strategy the way that it did after the [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2923.2s)]
*  Munich Olympics. This assassination within Iran shows that the Munich Olympic strategy, I mean, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2929.52s)]
*  they basically shown that it's successful. They've been able to do it. I wish they had [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2937.04s)]
*  limited their response in this more targeted way because I think that the destruction of Gaza has [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2941.36s)]
*  created tremendous humanitarian suffering, and it's alienated just about the whole world. And [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2946.88s)]
*  what has it accomplished? I don't think they've gotten rid of Hamas. They have not been able to [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2952.88s)]
*  kill the military leader of Hamas, which is Sinwar, who was the actual military planner [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2956.96s)]
*  of the October 7th attack. And they have radicalized whatever part of the Palestinian [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2963.6s)]
*  population was not radicalized has been radicalized. And they've turned so much of the Middle East and [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2970.48s)]
*  the world against them in such a strong way that, again, I wish that they had pursued the more [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2975.92s)]
*  measured strategy. Still a tough strategy. I mean, let me put you in Netanyahu's seat. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2982.4s)]
*  You are leading Israel. Hamas comes into your country attacks, kills lots of people. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2988.88s)]
*  What is your measured response to that attack from Hamas? Given the capacity you have, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=2996.4s)]
*  the Israeli Air Force, by the way, is second only to the United States. Just to give you some [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3002.64s)]
*  statistics, the Israeli Air Force has 90,000 active and reserve personnel and 614 aircraft. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3009.92s)]
*  Israel is reported to have up to 400 nuclear weapons. And they have this extraordinary [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3016.88s)]
*  technical capacity with Mossad and operational capacity that is kind of unrivaled pretty much [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3021.52s)]
*  anywhere in the world, it seems. What do you do if you're sitting in Netanyahu's seat that [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3026.56s)]
*  provides a more kind of measured response? And how do you kind of, you know, lead your nation? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3030.56s)]
*  Well, first of all, I'm not obviously sitting in that seat. I don't live in Israel and I don't [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3035.6s)]
*  have skin in the game that way. So I think the first thing that they would say is, you know, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3039.28s)]
*  you're not us. You're not sitting here dealing with all of our enemies in the region. And they [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3043.6800000000003s)]
*  would have a point. But what I advocated, I think, months ago was to take a more targeted, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3048.1600000000003s)]
*  measured strategy that I think the assassination of Haneeh shows that they could have executed. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3054.08s)]
*  And I understand why they went into Gaza and why they felt they needed to go into Gaza. But [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3060.1600000000003s)]
*  I just, this is not an anti-Israel statement. It's just a questioning of the strategy. I just don't [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3064.72s)]
*  see that as produced much good. I don't think they've solved their Hamas problem. They have [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3069.84s)]
*  not gotten SIN war and they've lost a meaningful amount of global support. Yeah. Chimot, do you [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3074.96s)]
*  want to read? I think that it was in hindsight, a pretty big miscalculation by Netanyahu to pursue [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3080.16s)]
*  the strategy that they did. And I would have much preferred what you're seeing now, which is a very [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3086.7999999999997s)]
*  targeted approach. I think it preserves and it would have preserved not just world political [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3094.0s)]
*  support, but just individual people support where instead of going into Gaza, leveling the place, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3101.12s)]
*  creating all of this death and destruction and amplifying and confusing people where they now, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3108.56s)]
*  all of a sudden had to make a decision between these two groups and now get confused with [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3118.08s)]
*  anti-Semitic sentiment. That should never have happened. It's clear that Mossad is incredibly [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3124.08s)]
*  competent and incredibly capable. I do believe that sovereign countries have the right to defend [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3130.4s)]
*  themselves. But then there was a bridge too far and I think the Israeli government has crossed it. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3137.7599999999998s)]
*  In hindsight, and I think I told you the story and I may have relayed this in confidence, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3146.0s)]
*  but I'll just say it again. On October the 8th, what was offered, and I'm not going to say by who, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3150.7200000000003s)]
*  was sort of a meeting of the right political leadership from the Middle East, Israel and [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3157.6s)]
*  the United States, where they were all willing to sort of come. And the idea would have been to [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3165.6800000000003s)]
*  extend some sort of structured solution for the Palestinian people. Now that would have been so [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3171.6s)]
*  unintuitive and unexpected. I think everybody would have been a little bit on their heels, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3180.16s)]
*  but I think what it would have done is it would have passed Netanyahu in an incredible light. It [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3184.7200000000003s)]
*  would have passed Israel in an incredible light. They would have still preserved the ability to go [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3190.7200000000003s)]
*  and kill the individual leaders that they wanted to. And then they would have been able to do so [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3195.36s)]
*  but it was rejected. And I think that when we look back, these are the kinds of decisions that [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3201.52s)]
*  hopefully history documents accurately so that folks who are in the seat to your point-free birth [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3206.4s)]
*  the next time around can make a different calculation. I see you see the pictures and [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3213.28s)]
*  there's just no way that you can turn them off. You know what I mean? I think Israel's biggest [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3217.92s)]
*  asset is probably also their biggest liability, which is their military and intelligence strength. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3224.4s)]
*  And it emboldens them in a way that they can be more aggressive than perhaps they need to be [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3230.48s)]
*  with respect to maintaining the security of the state, but perhaps being vengeful and vindictive. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3238.48s)]
*  And I know that that's a very controversial statement to be made. I want to underscore [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3244.5600000000004s)]
*  the strength of this military and this intelligence. Do you guys remember the Stuxnet [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3248.8s)]
*  worm from a number of years ago? That story was incredible. The New York Times broke this story [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3254.0800000000004s)]
*  in 2012. Stuxnet was a malicious computer worm. And I'm reading off of Wikipedia because there's [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3258.96s)]
*  a lot of reporting that has different opinions on this. That was first uncovered in 2010 and was [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3263.44s)]
*  thought to have been in development since at least 2005. Now this computer worm was supposedly [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3269.28s)]
*  developed by Mossad and the NSA. And it was a malicious computer worm that ultimately allowed [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3274.8s)]
*  intrusion into the control systems of the centrifuges of Iran's uranium refining systems. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3281.2s)]
*  And they basically were then able to make those centrifuges go haywire and destroyed themselves. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3289.28s)]
*  And they did this over and over for several years and the Iranians could not figure out [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3294.32s)]
*  what was going on or why. They kept it completely secret. Ultimately, it was revealed that there was [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3298.08s)]
*  this operation organized by the United States called Operation Olympic Games. That was a cyber [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3303.04s)]
*  disruption operation. And that Mossad had a critical role in. By the way, there are two other [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3307.36s)]
*  stories that build on top of this that are tangential but related. One is that there was [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3312.0s)]
*  a nuclear engineer that Israel felt should be unlit. And the way that they did it was via some [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3317.84s)]
*  like remote control machine gun that they planted off of like a highway where the car egressed off [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3327.04s)]
*  the highway and then all of a sudden the thing was shot up. A different example was there's a story [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3333.28s)]
*  about how they figured out that Yasser Arafat was sick because they were able to collect a stool [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3338.2400000000002s)]
*  sample from a pipe that left his home. And they were able to kind of diagnose that A, it was his [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3343.6s)]
*  stool and then B, he had some chronic illness. My point, I think, in all of this is kind of where [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3349.7599999999998s)]
*  you're going, which is that when you have such capability and such precision to go to the other [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3355.2799999999997s)]
*  end of the spectrum, you really have to be sure that you're right. And as Zach said, I think we're [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3361.68s)]
*  looking back and it's clear that the support around the world just isn't there for that kind [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3367.92s)]
*  of mass casualty and that kind of like... If Israel could actually destroy Hamas and [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3373.84s)]
*  achieve its military objective in Gaza, that'd be one thing. But I think we've seen that [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3378.64s)]
*  that's impossible. I mean, Hamas basically bleeds in with the population. It's indistinguishable. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3383.92s)]
*  And the leadership is hidden deep underground. And the Israelis have not been able to root them [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3390.16s)]
*  out against the war, has not been found. And so you've destroyed Gaza, but you have not achieved [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3395.28s)]
*  your objective of eliminating Hamas. And in the process, you've deeply alienated most of the world [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3400.96s)]
*  and you made the situation worse basically. It's like the Russians and the Americans trying to [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3407.2000000000003s)]
*  chase the Taliban and Afghanistan forever. This is not a group of individuals that once they're gone, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3411.52s)]
*  everything is fixed. Everything's just worse. I mean, you still have the same problem. In fact, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3418.32s)]
*  now the entire Palestinian population is radicalized. In fact, the whole Arab and [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3422.64s)]
*  Muslim population in the Middle East is more radicalized against you than they were before. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3426.56s)]
*  I mean, I know there was already a significant amount of hatred, but now it's worse. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3432.96s)]
*  And you haven't fundamentally solved the underlying issue. I think the 9-11 analogy is apt. I mean, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3436.48s)]
*  we went off after 9-11, half-cocked into all these wars in the Middle East. I think that going to [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3441.92s)]
*  Afghanistan, I think that was justified because they were harboring Al-Qaeda. But then we went [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3447.28s)]
*  into Iraq because really members of the Bush administration had a pre-existing agenda and then [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3454.1600000000003s)]
*  they lied us into it saying that Saddam was connected somehow to 9-11. And we began a 20-year [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3460.4s)]
*  process of just plunging ourselves into all of these wars. It only made everything worse. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3467.28s)]
*  One of the reasons why Iran is in such a strong position today in the Middle East is because we [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3472.8s)]
*  took out Iraq. We basically created a power vacuum in the Middle East that they ended up filling. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3476.72s)]
*  HOFFMAN I recently heard that [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3481.3599999999997s)]
*  after Israel struck the embassy in Damascus a few months ago, you may remember this, Iran launched a [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3484.08s)]
*  counterattack. And you remember there were all these drones that they sent hundreds of them [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3493.8399999999997s)]
*  into Israel, but there was supposedly a forewarning that these drones were on the way. There was [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3498.16s)]
*  notice given and it was like, this is it. This is our proportional response and we're done. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3504.16s)]
*  BOWEN That's right. That's right. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3507.8399999999997s)]
*  HOFFMAN What I heard was that Netanyahu did not want to stop. He wanted to escalate after that [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3510.0s)]
*  response from Iran. Now that coupled with what's going on in the West Bank right now, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3517.44s)]
*  where there is a restricted movement of Palestinians within the West Bank and continued [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3525.04s)]
*  development of Jewish settlements, I think really represents a major risk to the region, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3530.48s)]
*  the Middle East region, that we could see an escalation beyond the response that may be [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3535.92s)]
*  mandated or necessary to secure the state that makes things much, much worse in the region and [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3543.04s)]
*  could isolate Israel even further and ultimately draw a lot of powers to that region to try and [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3549.52s)]
*  figure out what side are you on and how do we resolve this? And that could lead to something [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3555.36s)]
*  much bigger and much nastier. So I think while we all observe this and watch this, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3560.48s)]
*  the behavior of the targeted attack in Hamas, for me, it's not the issue as much as indicating [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3564.8s)]
*  the capacity of this military, this intelligence that means that they probably feel highly [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3571.76s)]
*  emboldened to take whatever steps individuals feel are necessary to secure the state for the long run, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3576.7200000000003s)]
*  which could mean an increased escalation in conflict. And that's, I think, a real [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3583.44s)]
*  point of concern. And that's the one of the Black Swan events, I think, that's still outstanding [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3589.2000000000003s)]
*  right now. Because if that does happen, if there is, for example, an unraveling of the West Bank, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3593.44s)]
*  you could see one of these sorts of events that everyone gets brought like a magnet to the Middle [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3599.04s)]
*  East. And you end up with a major global conflict that becomes a problem for markets, it becomes a [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3605.04s)]
*  problem for the world. And that could be the catalyzing event that I don't think any of us [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3610.88s)]
*  want to see. To use your logic from before, the thing that may plunge the world into having to [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3614.8s)]
*  have a point of view on this may actually be a political calculus that Netanyahu has to engage [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3622.1600000000003s)]
*  in, which is around keeping small factions of his coalition government in place, which may not [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3627.44s)]
*  actually represent the full view of the Israeli people. That's what's even more tragic. So it's [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3632.0s)]
*  not obviously the Palestinians don't want it, but many Israelis may not want it either. And there [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3636.1600000000003s)]
*  may be no avenue if he wants to remain in power. And that's what's so scary. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3640.0s)]
*  Nat Sinclair Look, I think there's no question that we're on a path here where we could have [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3643.92s)]
*  a regional war in the Middle East. Remember that after Israel hit the Iranian general in Lebanon, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3647.76s)]
*  the Iranians responded two weeks later with that massive drone and missile attack. Most of the [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3658.16s)]
*  missiles were intercepted by Iron Dome. And I think America participated in that as well. I think one [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3663.92s)]
*  or two of them got through. And then Israel launched a weak missile attack on Iran, and that [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3669.76s)]
*  was the final word on it. There were people in Netanyahu's cabinet, like Smotrich and Ben Gavir, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3676.2400000000002s)]
*  sort of the more hardline radical right wingers, who I think publicly tweeted that they thought [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3681.76s)]
*  Israel's final word on it was weak. And they clearly wanted to do more. So I think the point [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3688.0s)]
*  is just that when we had this last exchange between Israel and Iran, it felt like it was on [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3693.6s)]
*  the verge of tipping over into a regional war. But I think partly due to the efforts of the United [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3699.7599999999998s)]
*  States, we were able to help tamp that down. I think now Iran's promising revenge for what just [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3704.96s)]
*  happened in Tehran. And this could set that escalatory spiral off again. If you were to [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3711.6s)]
*  place odds on this, I'd say it's at least 50-50 that things escalate into a regional war. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3719.84s)]
*  It's not as much of a black hole. Yeah. And by the way, there's no such thing as a regional war in [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3725.28s)]
*  the Middle East, because every one of those countries has significant allies in Russia, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3728.4s)]
*  in the United States, in China. What is Saudi Arabia going to do? Jordan is going to end up [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3733.44s)]
*  in a situation where they may end up having to defend the Palestinians in the West Bank, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3739.92s)]
*  which puts them across the shooting field from the Israelis. And the United States is an ally [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3744.32s)]
*  to both Israel and Jordan. What are we going to end up doing? And that's where this whole situation [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3749.36s)]
*  is not just about a regional conflict. It actually draws the whole world back to the Middle East. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3755.36s)]
*  This is why the counterfactual of what could have happened on October 8th is so important, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3762.4s)]
*  because that would have been UAE, United States, Saudi, and Israel. No, just those four. And [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3766.88s)]
*  hmm, let's put Qatar in the mix as well. But my point is like, my gosh, like that, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3776.48s)]
*  it could have rewritten world history in such a profound way. It would have just taken [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3781.28s)]
*  some restraint and proportionality. Turn the cheek the other way. Kind of. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3786.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it would require incredible forbearance on the part of a population that just been [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3791.84s)]
*  attacked. Attacked and attacked and attacked. With massive atrocities on civilians. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3797.04s)]
*  But not just this attack, like under attack for generations in a region that has been all [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3801.2s)]
*  about conflict and secularity and all of the kind of identity drivers that make this so deeply [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3807.8399999999997s)]
*  personal and rooted in history, not just in a moment or an event. Look, when it happened to [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3814.8799999999997s)]
*  us on 9-11, we lashed out. Yeah, exactly. But the results were not good. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3818.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, look, let's move on. I'm not trying to judge anyone's behavior. I'm just trying to [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3823.8399999999997s)]
*  shine a light on the strength of Israel's capacity and what that may mean for their [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3828.4s)]
*  proclivity for escalatory behavior, which is really scary given that this is not just a regional [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3833.76s)]
*  issue, it becomes a global issue when it does happen. Sorry, go ahead. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3838.56s)]
*  I thought you were going somewhere else with it, which is I was just going to say in any other [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3842.32s)]
*  simulation, the capability of the massade is fodder for incredible movies. Like it's out of a movie. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3847.52s)]
*  Right. You read these articles and they just don't seem like they're real. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3854.48s)]
*  It's like, what do you mean you smuggle the bomb into the safe house in Iran where all the VIPs [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3858.6400000000003s)]
*  stay? Two months ago. Two months ago. How does that happen? What does it mean that you actually [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3865.44s)]
*  developed? Yeah, then sit tight. What does it mean that you developed a virus that you're able to [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3870.6400000000003s)]
*  get into the actual working computers of the Iranian nuclear complex? The control boards [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3875.52s)]
*  which means that made by Siemens of the equipment made by Siemens that was shipped to Iran. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3884.2400000000002s)]
*  That's not like you tell that into something. You know what I mean? Like that means that there [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3889.84s)]
*  was a person physically there that then found a way to essentially get this firmware implanted. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3893.1200000000003s)]
*  And it's like, no, this is, you know what happened? I remember the story. They actually did not. What [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3899.5200000000004s)]
*  happened was they let the virus circulate in the world for years before someone randomly had it on [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3904.4s)]
*  a USB drive that didn't know they had it randomly plugged it into a computer in the center of each [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3911.68s)]
*  facility. Then infected sent out a notice. I'm in here. And then after years it was finally in there [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3916.7999999999997s)]
*  through the random movement of this virus that no one is that incredible? Anyway, that's incredible. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3922.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, let's wrap up with the Bill Ackman story. Sorry, before you do that. Yeah. I hate [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3927.04s)]
*  to make this political, but I just have to observe. I mean, look at this situation in the world. I [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3932.24s)]
*  mean, the Middle East is on the verge of regional war. We could be in a war there. I should say [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3936.3199999999997s)]
*  there could be a regional war there by January 20th when the next president is sworn in. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3941.52s)]
*  You've got the United States in a proxy war with Ukraine. You have major tensions [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3946.88s)]
*  with China in East Asia. I mean, is this really the time where you want to put in place an [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3951.92s)]
*  inexperienced president whose policy positions are unclear, who's untested, was never even tested by [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3957.84s)]
*  a primary, who the media refuses to test now? Who's basically a media construct. This seems to me like [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3962.56s)]
*  a really bad idea. All right. So political pitch in from David Sachs. We don't have Jake out here [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3969.44s)]
*  to give the other side, but let's keep going. So Bill Ackman's withdrawn his plans to IPO, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3975.6s)]
*  pushing Square. You know, Chamath, do you want to just give us kind of the background on what he [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3980.0s)]
*  was trying to do? And obviously this was an attempted $25 billion raise as an IPO. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3984.48s)]
*  He recently reduced the raise target to 2 billion. And when the order book came in, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3989.84s)]
*  I believe at less than a billion, he scrapped the plans entirely and just announced yesterday [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3994.48s)]
*  that he's pulling the IPO. So can you just explain a little bit about what this IPO was? [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=3998.88s)]
*  And then we'll talk a little bit about why we think it fell apart. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4003.76s)]
*  I can only repeat what I read, but I'll try to kind of like translate it into non-Wall Street [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4006.2400000000002s)]
*  speak. So basically he has a company, but what that company does is it gets investors to give [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4012.1600000000003s)]
*  it slash him money. And then they invest it in all kinds of things that they deem worthwhile. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4020.6400000000003s)]
*  Could be bonds, it could be stocks, it could be currencies, it could be derivatives. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4026.08s)]
*  They generate a return and then they give those returns back to their investors. So that is a [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4030.72s)]
*  hedge fund. The Holy grail has always been trying to figure out how can an organization that is- [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4035.36s)]
*  Sorry, those funds are raised and distributed back, right? I mean, I think you should- [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4041.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4044.72s)]
*  I don't want to interrupt, but yeah, let's just go ahead and say that. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4045.7599999999998s)]
*  But the Holy grail for someone who runs those businesses is when they realize, well, listen, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4048.4s)]
*  I get paid a great profit share from those funds when I'm successful. I'm also allowed to take a [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4052.8s)]
*  2% per year management fee, but I believe I'm building equity. And can I get somebody else to [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4060.0s)]
*  recognize the fact that I'm building equity? And that's no different than a startup, right? [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4066.88s)]
*  So, you know, Freeburg, you're building Ohalo. You believe that you're building all kinds of [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4071.28s)]
*  really interesting things rooted in science. And you want other people to judge the value of that [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4076.48s)]
*  as measured by your equity, right? Independent of your revenues and profits today, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4081.36s)]
*  they want to project into the future. The problem is that hedge funds have not found a very elegant [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4086.48s)]
*  way to demonstrate that they have any equity value. And there's only been a few, and the formula has [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4091.6800000000003s)]
*  been the same. So companies like Blackstone, companies like KKR, companies like Apollo, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4098.16s)]
*  what have they proven? They've proven that they can raise enormous amounts of money. So [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4106.48s)]
*  most of these organizations now are approaching a trillion dollars of capital raised. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4113.28s)]
*  And they tell investors, well, look, don't worry about the returns anymore, worry about the 2%, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4118.24s)]
*  because that's like our revenue. And we're generating $20 billion a year of revenue, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4123.919999999999s)]
*  that'll grow at some rateable proportion, we'll manage the teams, we'll compensate them well, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4128.799999999999s)]
*  but there'll be lots of profitability, and people have bought that story. So I think a lot of [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4134.4800000000005s)]
*  smaller organizations who aspire to be like a Blackstone or an Apollo have tried to get [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4139.76s)]
*  people to buy into this story. And I think what Bill Ackman was trying to do was some version of [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4145.52s)]
*  that, which is to say, I'm going to build an enterprise here, Pershing Square is going to be [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4152.0s)]
*  a standalone business, it's going to have enterprise value. And you're going to measure that [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4156.16s)]
*  based on the assets that I manage, and it's going to be much greater than what I managed today. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4161.52s)]
*  And I think he manages roughly 10 billion today. But he thought he was going to raise another 25 [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4166.240000000001s)]
*  in this IPO, and then in very short order, be a 50 billion. And so he got people to invest in that [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4171.200000000001s)]
*  business on that premise. And I think folks put in around a billion dollars, and they valued that [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4177.6s)]
*  entity at 10 billion. And so he tried to go and raise his fund, he thought it was going to be 25. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4182.88s)]
*  And it turned out, I thought it was two, but Freebird, you just said it's less than one, [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4188.72s)]
*  I didn't, I guess, or around one, I just heard that I'm just hearing that from you for the first time. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4192.64s)]
*  So I guess what is the takeaway? Like, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4198.0s)]
*  Chamath, real quick, you know, this, this was a this was a closed end fund he was trying to raise. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4200.8s)]
*  No, but he's I think he's also said that Pershing Square eventually has a path to go public. That's [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4205.12s)]
*  how we sold the billion of equity at 10 billion in the master LP. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4209.2s)]
*  Yeah, but this IPO was just for a fun. It was just there. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4213.68s)]
*  It was the IPO, the fund and then they were planning afterwards. The IPO planning afterwards. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4217.2s)]
*  Yeah, yes, which he didn't do. My only point was that that the fund was [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4221.44s)]
*  basically launching a fund. And then the goal is not the fund itself. The goal is to buttress the [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4225.12s)]
*  underlying logic to take the whole thing public the manager. Okay. And that's what I mean by [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4230.88s)]
*  taking a company public in finances next to impossible. Yeah. So the whole point is like, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4235.76s)]
*  what are these businesses in the business of doing their they're in the business of making bets. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4241.28s)]
*  The problem is that those bets are short term anomalous events. Sometimes they work, sometimes [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4245.76s)]
*  they don't work. And the problem with that is that investors who are trying to underwrite 20 or 30 [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4252.400000000001s)]
*  years of returns don't know how that's predictable over that period of time. Like, for example, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4258.24s)]
*  you're genetically engineering all kinds of produce that we are going to ingest. If that stuff works [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4263.52s)]
*  at scale, you will have built an enterprise that theoretically has the potential unless it's [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4270.16s)]
*  disrupted by something else to make revenue for 20 or 30 years. So people can underwrite that [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4274.4s)]
*  Google makes a search engine, it's going to last for 20 or 30 years, Facebook makes a [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4278.879999999999s)]
*  social network, it can last for 20 or 30 years. The business of making bets [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4283.599999999999s)]
*  is typically something that can only be measured in days or weeks, maybe months at best. And so I [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4288.799999999999s)]
*  think what he ran into was that realization, it's very hard to get people to value an institution [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4294.879999999999s)]
*  in this way. And so the thing did not work. He'll go back and he'll retool the thing that I give [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4302.400000000001s)]
*  Bill Ackman an enormous amount of credit for is he is one of the most resilient individuals I've [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4309.04s)]
*  ever seen in high finance, but generally as a business person, this guy has, he surfed some [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4314.32s)]
*  really big waves. He's landed some really good sets. He's also gotten crushed a few times and [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4320.88s)]
*  the guy just keeps coming back and he seems to be getting more and more refined and capable [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4325.92s)]
*  as a business person. So, you know, he'll probably figure out a way. This is not the first time he's [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4333.2s)]
*  publicly dealt with things that have not worked. But I think it just goes to show you that in [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4337.68s)]
*  finance, these entities that try to sell a piece of the quote unquote, general partner, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4344.0s)]
*  as a company, I just think that it's, frankly, it doesn't work. And this is just, you know, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4349.52s)]
*  an example, yet another example, that there's not a lot of equity value in these businesses. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4356.96s)]
*  Sachs, some reports indicate that investors pulled out of the Pershing Square IPO because [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4363.2s)]
*  of the current market conditions that a lot of market indices have stormed higher and that there [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4371.12s)]
*  is now less upside and it's not a great time to be entering the equity markets. Other reports [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4378.4s)]
*  indicate that investors lost interest in Ackman's fund because of his activity on X or Twitter. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4384.799999999999s)]
*  Have you, do you have a point of view? Do you think that folks pulled out, investors have pulled [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4392.0s)]
*  out? You're obviously a fund manager who is very active and opinionated on X and your slice order. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4395.839999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, do you think, has this affected your relationship with raising capital, if you're [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4402.0s)]
*  willing to talk about it, or maybe just comment on the Ackman issue that he ran into? Why did this [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4406.64s)]
*  fail? I just don't know. I honestly haven't followed his IPO process at all. I would say that the [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4411.360000000001s)]
*  market we have right now, it's not the best it's been, but it's also not the worst. So I'm always [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4418.240000000001s)]
*  reluctant to blame macro conditions without having a more specific explanation. Do you have a point [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4424.240000000001s)]
*  of view on investors having an issue with Ackman because of his outspokenness on various [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4430.08s)]
*  social and political issues over? I can't imagine. No, I can't imagine. I don't think so. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4436.0s)]
*  Investors care about making money and Bill Ackman is a moneymaker. Like that's undeniable. The guy [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4441.04s)]
*  takes some losses, but his wins are way bigger than his losses. And he is a proven moneymaker. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4446.88s)]
*  The problem is that I think the way in which he was trying to monetize the business is just a [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4452.16s)]
*  hard thing to do. You have to have an organization of hundreds approaching thousands of people that [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4458.08s)]
*  are raising all manner of funds. And those funds just deliver very consistent returns. Not great, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4463.84s)]
*  but they never lose money. And that's how you get towards a trillion dollars. And that's how you [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4470.8s)]
*  make it a company and not a great hedge fund. Let me also just say, I think he's very thoughtful [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4474.88s)]
*  on Twitter. I've gotten into some disagreements with him on Twitter, other things I've agreed [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4481.04s)]
*  with, but overall, I think he makes a strong case for himself. I haven't heard him say anything [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4485.360000000001s)]
*  out of bounds on Twitter, whether you agree with it or not. So I can't imagine that's a problem. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4490.32s)]
*  Some people would disagree. They think he's had a lot of comments on wokeism as he would call it [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4497.28s)]
*  and DEI topics. And I agree with him on that. And I think the vast majority of the country agrees that [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4502.08s)]
*  woke has jumped the shark. Yeah. But I think some people highlight if woke is so great, why is [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4509.28s)]
*  Kamala Harris trying to distance herself from every previous comment she's ever made about [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4514.96s)]
*  wokeism or DEI? The point is more about like what we talked about earlier, which is kind of having [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4519.76s)]
*  an authentic voice and speaking what you believe and speaking what your opinion is versus remaining [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4524.16s)]
*  buttoned up and not speaking what you believe and toeing the line. He's in the only industry [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4529.52s)]
*  where his performance is measurable every day in precision. Right. So what I would say is it's [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4535.2s)]
*  irrelevant what he says on Twitter, meaning the quality of his decisions are independent of what [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4542.96s)]
*  he says, because they're measurable and they are not something you can gain. And the reality is that [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4548.4s)]
*  over the last few years, particularly starting in COVID, he has gotten better and better. And he's [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4555.6s)]
*  played a very good hand. I think he's an exceptional risk manager, and he's time to. And so the people [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4561.2s)]
*  that say that to you, to be very honest, they're somewhat they're, they're portraying their lack [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4568.32s)]
*  of financial sophistication. Yeah. And actually, can I go further? And I actually think that [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4573.599999999999s)]
*  Ackman's presence on Twitter X is a huge positive for him. It's an asset because he has a gigantic [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4577.84s)]
*  followership and he's able to speak directly to his audience in the way that we do. And I think [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4584.16s)]
*  the reason why people say these things is because they don't have a direct strategy. And so they want [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4591.36s)]
*  to basically badmouth people who do. But again, if you don't go direct to your audience, then you [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4596.08s)]
*  have to go through the media and then they get to define you. And it creates ambiguity. Exactly. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4601.36s)]
*  So I think the fact that he's got what, like a million plus followers and, you know, everything [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4606.24s)]
*  he puts out gets tens of thousands of likes. It's a huge positive. Huge positive. And I think that [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4611.36s)]
*  the part of his business that he hasn't gone back to, which if he does in this chapter of his career [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4617.04s)]
*  with the following that he has, is the activism part. And I think there are two people who I think [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4624.72s)]
*  are incredible at this and where both the written and the spoken word, they have such a mastery of. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4632.8s)]
*  Ackman is one, Dan Loeb is the other. And I think that, you know, in this world where you have the [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4639.92s)]
*  ability to go direct in a way that you've never had before is actually the realm of [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4645.68s)]
*  a different form of activism that I think could be extremely economically rewarding [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4650.48s)]
*  and valuable in society. All right, gentlemen, this has been a great episode of the All in Pod. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4658.4s)]
*  We missed our comedian in residence, Jason Kalakiannis, Nostrallanus, we miss him, [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4662.719999999999s)]
*  we wish him well, speedy recovery. This has been an episode without the usual humor and flamboyancy [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4669.839999999999s)]
*  that we've all come to know and love. But I think it was great to chat this afternoon. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4676.639999999999s)]
*  And we will see you all next week. Bye bye. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4681.36s)]
*  I'm doing all in [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4736.719999999999s)]
*  I'm doing all in [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj71DPhvpiE&t=4744.799999999999s)]
