*  Get a lawnmower. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=20.68s)]
*  Manscape makes one. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=21.68s)]
*  I'm going to get it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=22.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=23.68s)]
*  Just look in the mirror, bro. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=24.68s)]
*  Can you come over on the way to Parker Freberg and help me manscape? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=25.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=28.240000000000002s)]

*  Okay. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=32.48s)]
*  So, J Cal, you're going to be a participant today. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=33.48s)]
*  The world's greatest moderator is taking a week off to allow his voice to recoup, to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=53.599999999999994s)]
*  to heal so he can come back blaring with his usual mid-sentence interruptions and excellent [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=58.52s)]
*  moderating tactics next week. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  With his foghorn leghorn moderation. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  We are going to miss you at the moderation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=70.0s)]
*  Welcome to the top 20, Sachs. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=72.36s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=73.36s)]
*  Welcome to the top 20 podcasts in the world. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=74.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=76.48s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=77.48s)]
*  Who should be thinking whom? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=78.48s)]
*  I mean, you've been doing this for 10 years. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=79.48s)]
*  I walk in here off the street. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=80.48s)]
*  All of a sudden we're top 20. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=82.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=83.08s)]
*  Let me explain something to you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=84.08s)]
*  I created with my guys Engadget. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=85.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=88.28s)]
*  Top five magazine in the world. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=89.28s)]
*  Then I do a podcast with you three idiots. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=90.28s)]
*  And all of a sudden I dropped out to top 20 in this medium. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=91.84s)]
*  So drop. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=93.96s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=94.96s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=95.96s)]
*  I dropped. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=96.96s)]
*  This has been a B tested. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=97.96s)]
*  No, I mean, this week at startup is a niche. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=98.96s)]
*  Look at twist ratings compared to ours. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=101.96s)]
*  This week in startups is a bout startups. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=104.12s)]
*  It is a niche audience by design and it's the number one startup podcast in the world. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=105.64s)]
*  That's what you wanted this show to be. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=110.32s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=111.56s)]
*  This show is about all topics. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=112.56s)]
*  Every time we try to talk politics, you're like, it's too much politics, Sachs. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=115.2s)]
*  I think you're talking about framework. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  I think you're talking about framework. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  Let's focus on narrow legalistic tech issues. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=121.04s)]
*  Not true. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  We had this discussion, Sachs, and I said we should always do the top story of the week, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  even if it's politics. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  And now you're taking credit for my insight about McLaughlin group. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=129.48000000000002s)]
*  I saw you on some pod. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=133.52s)]
*  Who was it? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=135.12s)]
*  I absolutely designed this pod around McLaughlin. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=136.12s)]
*  The fact that you also watch McLaughlin. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=138.68s)]
*  I'm the one who said McLaughlin group. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=140.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=142.68s)]
*  It's possible for two people to have the same idea, Sachs. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=143.68s)]
*  We both grew up on McLaughlin group. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=146.44s)]
*  That's why we're both cantankerous assholes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=147.88s)]
*  Moderator intervention. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=150.64000000000001s)]
*  Cut it out. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  No one is individually responsible for this podcast. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  It was Tim Ferriss. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=156.4s)]
*  Yeah, Tim Ferriss. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=157.4s)]
*  Here's what happened. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=158.4s)]
*  So I was on YouTube and I'm not going to watch some two hour podcast with J. Cal, of course. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=159.4s)]
*  But for some reason, Tim Ferriss clipped. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=165.24s)]
*  A clip 10 minutes of J. Cal. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=169.84s)]
*  The video is called the origin of the All In podcast. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=174.16s)]
*  I can't stand what he does. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=176.24s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=177.24s)]
*  Here we go. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=178.24s)]
*  I can't stand what he does. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=179.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=180.24s)]
*  So I'm like, okay, well, I got to watch this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=181.24s)]
*  So I wrote this in the partnership agreement. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=182.24s)]
*  He said, here's the party line and J. Cal will not stick with it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=183.24s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to recreate history. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=185.28s)]
*  I got to watch this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=186.76s)]
*  I got to see this alternative reality that J. Cal is trying to create about the origin [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=187.76s)]
*  of the All In podcast. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=191.12s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=192.12s)]
*  I wrote in our legal agreement. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=193.12s)]
*  A fake history, yes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=194.12s)]
*  And I changed it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=195.12s)]
*  No. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=196.12s)]
*  The origin story that you signed up to. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=197.12s)]
*  Are you saying you changed the origin story? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=198.96s)]
*  No, it remains the same. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=200.92000000000002s)]
*  No, it doesn't. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  You call me after CMB. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the origin story that he told Tim Ferriss, which is like a 10 minute story of how he [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  created the whole thing. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  The concept was his. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  It was based on McLaughlin group, which I'm the one who suggested that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  The moderation concept is obviously by default. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  How I moderate the program is by my design, yes. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=215.36s)]
*  You didn't come up with this concept. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=218.36s)]
*  Much to your chagrin. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  Of course I did. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=221.16s)]
*  No. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=222.16s)]
*  Of course I designed my moderation. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=223.16s)]
*  Who designed my moderation? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=224.16s)]
*  The first one who said we should record us having conversations at the poker table. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=225.64s)]
*  No. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=230.64s)]
*  That idea came from him, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=231.64s)]
*  That's why it's called the All In Pod. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=233.12s)]
*  No. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=234.32s)]
*  I came up with the name All In, number one. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=235.32s)]
*  Number two, it was his idea to tape a pod because he came out of CMC. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=236.32s)]
*  Anyway, who cares? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=239.96s)]
*  The pod's here. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=240.96s)]
*  It's successful. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=241.96s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=242.96s)]
*  Why do you keep going on podcasts telling everyone that you're the mastermind of the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=243.96s)]
*  All In Pod? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=246.92s)]
*  People are saying J. Cal. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=248.4s)]
*  What do you have to gain? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=249.4s)]
*  Other podcasters. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=250.4s)]
*  I'll explain it to you. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=251.4s)]
*  Other podcasters are in awe of my ability to moderate you three malcontents. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  You did not have the idea for the foursome based on McLaughlin Group. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=256.96s)]
*  That happened spontaneously as a result of the fact that no, Freeberg was I think the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=260.76s)]
*  first guest. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=266.4s)]
*  I was the second guest. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=267.4s)]
*  Then we did the four of us together. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=268.64s)]
*  That was not your concept. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=270.96s)]
*  The moderation, how this is moderated. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=271.96s)]
*  It was a jam session that worked out. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=272.96s)]
*  That's it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=275.96s)]
*  Fine. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  The way I moderate this is of note to the world's greatest podcasters. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  J. Cal, how do you take three misanthropic malcontents and make them actually palatable [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  to the world? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=288.84000000000003s)]
*  I say, you know what? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  Because I am the world's greatest moderator. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  Someone like Tim Ferriss wants to know. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=292.56s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=293.96s)]
*  What makes me a misanthropic malcontent? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=295.2s)]
*  Just your behavior and worldview. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=298.36s)]
*  What is it? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=300.96s)]
*  Describe that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=301.96s)]
*  What is my behavior and what is my worldview? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=302.96s)]
*  Your absolute contempt for humanity. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=304.92s)]
*  You're ignoring everybody. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=306.52s)]
*  I don't have contempt for anybody. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=307.52s)]
*  No. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=310.52s)]
*  It's a joke. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  It's called a joke. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  It's called a joke. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=313.91999999999996s)]
*  Now you set him off, J. Cal. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=314.91999999999996s)]
*  That hurt. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  You should apologize. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=318.03999999999996s)]
*  It's called a joke. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=319.12s)]
*  I think you guys are wonderful. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=320.28s)]
*  I think you guys are wonderful. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=322.08s)]
*  I may be misanthropic, but malcontent I'm not. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=323.08s)]
*  No, Saxon Friedberg are the malcontents for sure. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=325.76s)]
*  I'm not malcontent. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=327.76s)]
*  I'm pretty damn happy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=328.76s)]
*  You're happy? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=329.76s)]
*  The last descriptor anybody who knows you would ascribe to Friedberg was happy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=330.76s)]
*  No, I think he's happy. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  He's anxious, but he's happy. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  He's anxious, but happy. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=338.96s)]
*  Did you see the roast? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=340.52s)]
*  That was not a happy man. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=342.64s)]
*  That was tearing you up. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=344.24s)]
*  That was funny. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=345.24s)]
*  That was a misanthropic part of him. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=347.24s)]
*  Yeah, that was venting. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=349.71999999999997s)]
*  He was venting. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  That was rage. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=351.71999999999997s)]
*  It was pure rage. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  No, I think when Friedberg tries to be funny, it comes out kind of mean. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, maybe that's true. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=357.52s)]
*  It's a little bit of rage. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=359.15999999999997s)]
*  The only person that sets me off into making me unhappy is you, J. Cal. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=361.28s)]
*  The four of us could go to therapy or we could keep recording this podcast every week. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=364.35999999999996s)]
*  Which is cheaper. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=370.44s)]
*  I think it's cheaper for us to just record the podcast. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=371.44s)]
*  You know what? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=373.47999999999996s)]
*  I, for one, am thankful to whoever gave you whatever sickness you have that causes you [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  to not be able to talk this week. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=379.2s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=380.56s)]
*  You're talking a lot for a guy who can't talk. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=381.56s)]
*  You guys are coming at me. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=383.35999999999996s)]
*  I'm sick. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=385.47999999999996s)]
*  Be nice to me. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  While we're talking about all kinds of random stuff, the number two thing that I see in [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=387.64s)]
*  the What's Happening tab on Twitter right now is how Ron DeSantis is getting blasted [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=392.96s)]
*  for banning AP African-American studies because he thinks it falls under the Stop [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=398.48s)]
*  Woke Act. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=404.48s)]
*  That's the headlines. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  It's going absolutely nuclear on Twitter right now. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=407.0s)]
*  Here's some of the quotes. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=410.52000000000004s)]
*  Shocking. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  Ron DeSantis has banned, all caps, the teaching of AP African-American studies in Florida. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=412.52000000000004s)]
*  Florida has gone from don't say gay to don't say black. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  Next tweet. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  Claiming it violates the Stop Woke Act and has no educational value, Florida Governor [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  Let me make a prediction right now. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=426.04s)]
*  This will all run down to his advantage. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=430.12s)]
*  The same people who said that he was death-Santis for basically not instituting COVID lockdowns, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=432.76000000000005s)]
*  he was proven correct. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=438.32000000000005s)]
*  Then they said that this bill that prohibited the teaching of gender fluidity to five-year-olds, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=439.6s)]
*  they try to claim that was a don't say gay bill. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=445.68s)]
*  70% of Florida supports that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=448.12s)]
*  That ran down to his advantage. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=449.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't know the story behind this particular course, but if the question is whether CRT [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=451.48s)]
*  is going to be funded by the state and he's preventing that, again, I think that'll be [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=457.8s)]
*  a 70% popular issue. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=461.12s)]
*  Let's just wait and see how this plays out. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=463.20000000000005s)]
*  Fair enough. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=464.76s)]
*  I just want to claim that my spread trade may be ... It's tough to be the leader in [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=465.76s)]
*  the Republican nomination process in January of 2022. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=471.52000000000004s)]
*  It's starting. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=475.44s)]
*  Sorry, 2023. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=476.44s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=477.44s)]
*  It's tough to be the front runner in either party. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=478.44s)]
*  I'd say the bigger threat to the Santas is there's a new poll where Trump came out on [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=480.68s)]
*  top. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=485.92s)]
*  Trump's still his biggest threat. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=486.92s)]
*  Unfortunately, J. Cal may be right that the Republicans may do something stupid here and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=489.04s)]
*  nominate a candidate who's, I think, less electable than DeSantis. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=494.72s)]
*  I actually don't take any joy in it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=499.0s)]
*  I think Nikki Haley's going to come out of nowhere and win this thing. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=501.16s)]
*  It's possible. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=504.4s)]
*  I really would like to see some non-political, non-career politicians run for office, the [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=505.79999999999995s)]
*  Bloomberg category. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=512.68s)]
*  It feels like these career politicians are just really, really bad at executing. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=514.64s)]
*  It's gone bad. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=520.1999999999999s)]
*  You know who likes Nikki Haley? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  Who? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=523.6s)]
*  Democrats. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=524.6s)]
*  Democrats, you guys. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=525.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=526.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=527.6s)]
*  Why do we like her? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=528.6s)]
*  I'm an independent. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=529.6s)]
*  She's polarizing. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=530.6s)]
*  She's polarizing. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=531.6s)]
*  She's a pro-life Republican who basically is not going to put up any fierce resistance [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=532.6s)]

*  I don't think that's true. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=540.0s)]
*  I think she was pretty... [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=541.0s)]
*  She's not going to win the Republican nomination. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=542.0s)]
*  I don't think she cares about Davos people to save her life. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=543.8000000000001s)]
*  I think that she is a moderate, reasonable person who had to govern in a southern state [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=546.24s)]
*  and got everybody on board. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=551.12s)]
*  That's pretty crazy. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=554.28s)]
*  pro-life person who negotiated a 20-week support for abortion in 2014. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=555.28s)]
*  This is a person that knows how to get stuff done. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=564.12s)]
*  South Carolina happens to be the state that's actually at the leading edge of climate transition. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=566.88s)]
*  She's had more jobs and more money come in into a southern red state of people and companies [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=571.9599999999999s)]
*  willing to build for climate change than any other state in the country. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=577.9399999999999s)]
*  You like her at the time? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=581.28s)]
*  I just think that she's actually normal and sane and not an idiot. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=583.12s)]
*  Would you vote for her? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=587.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=588.52s)]
*  Over Biden? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=589.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=590.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=591.52s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=592.52s)]
*  100%. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=593.52s)]
*  Yeah, look, if you're really willing to vote for her, then that's interesting. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=594.52s)]
*  Absolutely, I would. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=597.12s)]
*  She's young. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=599.0799999999999s)]
*  Her parents had a small business. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  She was a small business person. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=601.64s)]
*  It's tough to be a winner at all of those levels, and she managed to do it. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=604.36s)]
*  How do you, as a brown woman, get elected to governor of South Carolina and do a lot [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=609.8s)]
*  of really good stuff? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=616.12s)]
*  That's kind of tough. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=617.4799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=618.4799999999999s)]
*  So, I don't know. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=619.4799999999999s)]
*  I think she deserves a close look, and she's the only one that didn't kowtow to Trump. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=620.4799999999999s)]
*  She was able to play the game, manipulate him, get him to be on her side, and then still [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=624.5999999999999s)]
*  told him to go pounce in. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=628.52s)]
*  That's pretty cool. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=630.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, a lot of governors managed to do that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  No, no, I'm saying she went to the United Nations. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=634.0799999999999s)]
*  She did what she needed to do there. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=637.5s)]
*  That's an important role at that time. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=640.26s)]
*  Actually, Nikki Haley expressly has said she will not run if Trump runs, so she's kowtowed [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=642.26s)]
*  to Trump too. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=646.62s)]
*  She wanted to be his VP, right? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=647.98s)]
*  She was trying to shank Pence, right? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=649.42s)]
*  That was her plan. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=652.02s)]
*  Maybe it's a smart strategy, but she said she will not run against Trump. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=653.02s)]
*  The main alternative to Trump in the Republican Party is DeSantis, and then I'd say the number [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=656.78s)]
*  three in the Republican Party after Trump and DeSantis is Glenn Youngkin right now. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=659.94s)]
*  Based on what metrics? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=664.38s)]
*  Based on interest in the party. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=666.1s)]
*  And, you know, I've talked to people and I think the polling will eventually reflect [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=667.58s)]
*  this. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=670.78s)]
*  He's very talented. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=671.78s)]
*  J. Cal. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=672.78s)]
*  You talk about appealing to independence. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=673.78s)]
*  He was able to win a blue state. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=675.4200000000001s)]
*  Remember, Virginia went for Biden by 10 points and Youngkin was able to win that state. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=677.9s)]
*  If you ever listen to him campaign, he's a very talented campaigner. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=682.78s)]
*  I think Youngkin is very, very talented. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=686.1s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=688.0600000000001s)]
*  And I think that he would be an extremely credible candidate for president. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=689.0600000000001s)]
*  Here's the thing that Youngkin will get destroyed on is he's literally not been in the job for [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=692.3s)]
*  but for a few, you know, 18 months. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=697.8599999999999s)]
*  So he hasn't done anything. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=701.0999999999999s)]
*  And I think that if it does boil down now, it may not matter, right? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=702.6999999999999s)]
*  Because look, Obama was a senator for two years or whatever, right? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=707.3599999999999s)]
*  So it may not matter. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=710.54s)]
*  But to the extent that Republicans demand some bona fides, I think that you'll see Trump [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=711.8599999999999s)]
*  and DeSantis attack Youngkin more viciously in a presidential primary than they attack [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=717.66s)]
*  Haley on that dimension of you have no experience and it'll be hard for him to back it up. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=723.9799999999999s)]
*  This one final point, you know, Virginia has this- [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=729.62s)]
*  If you had to steel man the other side, that's what they would say. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=730.62s)]
*  Final point. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=733.3399999999999s)]
*  We got to get started. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=734.3399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, final point. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=735.3399999999999s)]
*  Virginia has this wonky one term term limit on governors. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=736.3399999999999s)]
*  So you know, he's got no choice but to make a play in 2024 because he's going to be termed [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=738.86s)]
*  out anyway. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=745.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay, J Cal, as a lifelong independent who's only ever voted Democrat, which of these Republican [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=746.5200000000001s)]
*  candidates would you vote for? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=751.6400000000001s)]
*  75% Republican, 25% Republican to be clear. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=752.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=754.2s)]
*  So which of these candidates would you vote for? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=755.2s)]
*  He voted for Republican one time when he was 12. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=756.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=758.5200000000001s)]
*  No, I voted three times. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=759.5200000000001s)]
*  You like Dickie Haley? [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=760.5200000000001s)]
*  You like Glenn Youngkin? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=761.5200000000001s)]
*  Three times I voted Republican. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=762.5200000000001s)]
*  I would like somebody who's younger. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=765.44s)]
*  And actually I've been quite influenced by your framing of a person who can control the [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=767.36s)]
*  budget and reduce spending. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=772.44s)]
*  Because I do think it's kind of the most existential risk we have right now. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=773.8800000000001s)]
*  So I might be moving to more of a single issue vote for this presidential election. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=777.8000000000001s)]
*  I love that issue. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=783.32s)]
*  I love that about you. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=784.32s)]
*  Which is I just think like, we have to have somebody younger who is not going to bankrupt [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=785.32s)]
*  the company. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=790.44s)]
*  And the more these candidates talk about social issues and not economic ones, I think it's [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=791.44s)]
*  a tell that they're not the right person for the job. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=796.6s)]
*  That's where I'm personally at, is that this country has a serious financial existential [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=799.48s)]
*  crisis on its hands and we have to get off social issues and we have to get on to financial [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=805.76s)]
*  austerity. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=810.6s)]
*  Excellent point. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=811.6s)]
*  So I assume then you support the Republicans in this looming budget showdown. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=812.6s)]
*  I actually do. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=816.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=818.12s)]
*  I do think we should hold the line on spending. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=819.12s)]
*  So you support the Republicans voting no on raising the debt ceiling. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=821.64s)]
*  Yeah, I actually do. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=826.4s)]
*  I think we should start pumping the brakes on spending. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=827.76s)]
*  And I do think the Tea Party. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=831.0400000000001s)]
*  Now, that doesn't mean I like those candidates. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=832.8000000000001s)]
*  They're kind of whack jobs, actually. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=836.32s)]
*  But you think George Santos is a whack job? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=838.2s)]
*  Listen, it's the whack pack. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=840.52s)]
*  The Republican Party has turned into some crazy Howard Stern whack pack. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=842.96s)]
*  Sax is appalled by it. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=848.2s)]
*  He just can't. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=849.28s)]
*  Some elements of both parties look that way. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=850.28s)]
*  Would you ever invite to Moor Santos to your house? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=852.72s)]
*  Who would you invite? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=855.22s)]
*  You have to reel the question. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=856.22s)]
*  Steal the silverware. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=857.22s)]
*  Who would you be willing to host a dinner for at your house? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=858.22s)]
*  Not a fundraising dinner, but just invite to the house. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=861.86s)]
*  You can pick between two people. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=864.1s)]
*  Oh, no. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=865.26s)]
*  Alexander Ocasio-Cortez or George Campos. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=866.26s)]
*  Who would you pick? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=868.5s)]
*  Oh, AOC. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=869.5s)]
*  Who would you pick? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=870.5s)]
*  Sure. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=871.5s)]
*  I'd rather probably meet and talk to AOC. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=872.5s)]
*  Of course. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=873.98s)]
*  Because it would be interesting. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=874.98s)]
*  Do I want to fundraise for her? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=875.98s)]

*  No, no, no. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=877.98s)]
*  I'm not asking fundraising. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=878.98s)]
*  Just let in the door. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=879.98s)]
*  Front door. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=881.02s)]
*  Unlock the front door for her. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=882.02s)]
*  Unlock the front door of the Mausoleum. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=883.02s)]
*  I would talk to AOC. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=884.02s)]
*  Yeah, I would talk to AOC. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=885.02s)]
*  Would you not even return the email if he said, David, I'm in town. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=886.8199999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't let him in the main house. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=889.78s)]
*  I'd like to come for dinner. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=890.78s)]
*  Don't let him in the main house. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=891.78s)]
*  I wouldn't want to deal with him. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=892.78s)]
*  Yeah, he might steal the silverware or something. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=893.78s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=896.78s)]
*  I mean, it's so nuts. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=899.78s)]
*  Listen, hold on, hold on, hold on. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=901.78s)]
*  We got to get started. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=903.14s)]
*  As your moderator, I'm going to try and keep us on track. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=904.14s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=906.62s)]
*  Yeah, no, look, it's an energetic day. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=907.62s)]
*  Welcome to my world. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=910.26s)]
*  I appreciate my co-hosts and their enthusiasm for all topics. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=911.54s)]
*  I'm going to give Jacob enough recognition for supporting the Republicans in this budget [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=914.3s)]
*  showdown. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=917.5s)]
*  I mean, I'm like blown away by this. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=918.5s)]
*  I think it's great. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=920.2199999999999s)]
*  I think it's great. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=921.2199999999999s)]
*  As you guys know, just to restate, it's my number one concern on earth today. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=922.2199999999999s)]
*  And I think that the importance of this topic really needs to kind of rise above politics. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=926.78s)]
*  Of all the things you've said, Freeberg, in the last like six months on this program, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=931.5799999999999s)]
*  it's the one thing that stuck with me. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=935.1s)]
*  And it's one thing that has like actually now I realize is the most important thing [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=936.9399999999999s)]
*  for this country is fiscal responsibility, austerity measures, and looking at how we're [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=940.86s)]
*  spending money and looking at immigration and looking at economic velocity and employment [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=945.42s)]
*  and competing on the world stage with a solid balance sheet is the balance sheet is how [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=952.14s)]
*  you compete. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=957.1s)]
*  The balance sheet is how you compete. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=958.22s)]
*  I think it rises above social issues and it rises above climate change. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=959.98s)]
*  It dwarfs them. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=963.98s)]
*  Because you cannot address climate change or social issues or infrastructure or unemployment [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=964.98s)]
*  unless we have the ability to operate as a country over the long term and have the ability [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=970.3399999999999s)]
*  to have the continuing credit of the United States dollar. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=975.9799999999999s)]
*  And that's why I think it's so important. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=980.4599999999999s)]
*  Freeberg, I'm dealing this with startups I have right now. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=981.7399999999999s)]
*  And I tell them the balance sheet is how you compete. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=984.56s)]
*  If your balance sheet is flipped upside down and you're going to be out of business in [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=987.8199999999999s)]
*  nine months, you're not competing with these two other companies in your sector. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=990.78s)]
*  You have to have a strong balance sheet, take the austerity measures, make the cuts, and [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=994.3399999999999s)]
*  then compete with a strong balance sheet. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=999.14s)]
*  It's just so obvious. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1001.78s)]
*  This country's balance sheet is getting flipped upside down and we are going to have so many [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1002.78s)]
*  very complex second and third order effects with the interest payments. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1008.42s)]
*  If you value austerity, if you value austerity, if you look back in history and you actually [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1013.18s)]
*  ask of the prime ministers or presidents of various countries, particularly first world [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1018.02s)]
*  countries that have actually had an impact in implementing austerity, you know what the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1022.86s)]
*  unifying thing that I can say is women do a much better job than men. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1026.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1031.2199999999998s)]
*  You want austerity, you're better off with Margaret Thatcher than you are with a dude, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1032.54s)]
*  aka Nikki Haley, interstate. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1038.1s)]
*  It's a very hard position to be in as a politician because you have to position your objective [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1043.7399999999998s)]
*  as one of taking things away. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1050.1s)]
*  And the primary way to get elected in a democracy, just like in junior high when you run for [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1052.4199999999998s)]
*  president of the junior high class, is I'm going to make the vending machines free. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1056.06s)]
*  You get elected. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1059.86s)]
*  And when you run in politics, you always promise your constituents what they're going to get [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1061.02s)]
*  that they don't have today. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1064.3799999999999s)]
*  And that's the model for getting elected. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1065.82s)]
*  Whatever the issue is of the day, whatever the issue du jour, de decade, whatever, it's [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1067.8999999999999s)]
*  all about what I'm going to give you that you don't have today. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1071.3s)]
*  And so to flip that conversation around we all have to sacrifice together for the long [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1073.82s)]
*  term viability of our economic prosperity, we need to give up the following things. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1079.02s)]
*  That is a very hard platform to run on when someone on the other side of the podium on [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1085.44s)]
*  the other side of the stage is saying I'm going to give you these 10 things. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1089.52s)]
*  And it's very hard to get elected. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1092.6200000000001s)]
*  And that's why democracies ultimately eat themselves. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1093.7s)]
*  And I forgot who said it, but ultimately all democracies end up realizing they can vote [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1096.76s)]
*  themselves all the money. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1100.48s)]
*  And then you have this big cycle. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1102.26s)]
*  Republicans did the most brilliant thing ever recently. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1104.8s)]
*  They moved from stop the steal to stop the spend. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1107.22s)]
*  This is a genius thing they stumbled into. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1110.52s)]
*  Everybody wants to hear them talking about the election being stolen. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1114.44s)]
*  That's complete nonsense. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1117.28s)]
*  But stop the spend. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1118.56s)]
*  We all understand that. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1120.0800000000002s)]
*  Everybody is seeing it in their own personal balance sheets or seeing it in their companies. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1121.6000000000001s)]
*  They're seeing it in their families. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1125.44s)]
*  They're seeing it with their mortgage payment. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1127.2s)]
*  They're looking at their college tuition bills. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1129.18s)]
*  They're looking at their car payments going from 400 to $700 and they're seeing what variable [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1132.28s)]
*  interest does. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1137.9s)]
*  We have variable interest debt. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1138.9s)]
*  This stuff is going to skyrocket. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1140.56s)]
*  Whether it's Elon's payments for Twitter or your payments for your mortgage or our country's [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1142.46s)]
*  payments for our debt, we have to stop the spend. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1147.1799999999998s)]
*  You're talking about the effective interest rates. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1149.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1152.56s)]
*  Yeah, but guys, let's just continue the conversation and talk a little bit about this World Economic [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1153.56s)]
*  Forum gathering that took place in Davos. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1159.12s)]
*  I know you guys wanted to talk about it this week. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1161.6399999999999s)]
*  Can I just applaud J. Cal's intellectual honesty? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1163.84s)]
*  I'm like blown away right now. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1166.36s)]
*  Well, because he's sick. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1167.56s)]
*  Okay, so look. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1168.56s)]
*  No, it's because I'm not moderating. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1169.56s)]
*  When I moderate, I'm always trying to get the best out of you, Sax. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1170.56s)]
*  The budget conversation is an important one as it relates also to the global economy and [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1173.96s)]
*  growth. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1178.32s)]
*  Davos took place over this past week, just so everyone knows. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1179.32s)]
*  I remember working at Google 2004. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1184.2s)]
*  I remember how exciting it was for the executives to start to transition into the Davos stage. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1189.0s)]
*  It became this moment where you're finally on the world stage. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1194.48s)]
*  It's an exciting moment for CEOs, for world leaders, for global economists to get together, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1198.2s)]
*  talk about the state of the global economy, where the world is headed, what we can and [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1204.38s)]
*  should be doing about it. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1208.6000000000001s)]
*  Davos is also this place of pride and prestige for being invited and being a part of the [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1210.8s)]
*  party, the global elite party, as some people are now calling it. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1215.44s)]
*  That's what I think is the important conversation, is that the World Economic Forum gathering [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1219.4s)]
*  recently been cast as this gathering of the global elites, those who are trying to take [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1224.84s)]
*  control and run the world as they see fit. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1229.72s)]
*  Sax, I'd love your point of view on how that transition has happened. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1233.1999999999998s)]
*  One of the important ways that the Davos gathering has been cast and the World Economic Forum [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1237.1999999999998s)]
*  has been cast is in the negative light of being globalists. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1241.56s)]
*  Globalism has had a really important role in driving global economic growth and prosperity. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1246.12s)]
*  It has had these adverse effects in the US, as we've seen with wealth inequality, loss [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1251.92s)]
*  of jobs, offshoring, gutting of industries, and so on. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1255.94s)]
*  I think that there's a really important way that Davos has been politicized, but the risk [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1260.48s)]
*  of that is significant, because if we do lean into this globalist notion and say it's all [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1264.9s)]
*  about elites trying to take control of our world and we all become isolationists, that [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1269.3400000000001s)]
*  countries around the world can suffer deeply from the economic consequences of that shift. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1273.52s)]
*  Maybe Sax, you can kick this off, especially in light of our conversation today about the [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1278.8s)]
*  need for economic growth and the reduction of global debt to support a more prosperous [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1282.8799999999999s)]
*  world in the future. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1287.32s)]
*  This idea that right now we're talking about Davos and the World Economic Forum as a gathering [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1288.84s)]
*  of global elites, and maybe Sax, you can kind of give us a history and a point of view on [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1292.72s)]
*  how that position has come about. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1296.32s)]
*  Well, it's a meeting of global business and government leaders, so they are the elites. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1298.28s)]
*  You add them all together and they do control a substantial portion of the world economy [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1304.16s)]
*  and most of the nations with the biggest economies. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1308.52s)]
*  So there's no question these are some of the most important people in the world. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1313.76s)]
*  A bunch of the articles coming out of Davos reported the somber mood and tone of the conference, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1316.64s)]
*  the level of anxiety and worry was very high. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1322.0400000000002s)]
*  And I think that for a brief moment, it looked like these people were staring in the mirror [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1325.64s)]
*  and realizing that their management of the global economy over the last couple of decades [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1331.8s)]
*  has been a bit of a disaster. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1336.44s)]
*  I mean, you do have ruinous deficits and debts piling up in both the US and across the world, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1338.68s)]
*  something like 350% debt to GDP globally. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1344.88s)]
*  So we've talked about that. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1348.16s)]
*  You've got this war in Ukraine that I and many people around the world think was easily [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1349.68s)]
*  avoidable and was a diplomatic failure. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1355.0s)]
*  You're coming off of two years of badly botched COVID mismanagement where the governments [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1357.34s)]
*  of the world pursued a horrible policy on COVID and made everything worse. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1363.1s)]
*  You've got decades of energy policy promoted by the World Economic Forum where they want [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1366.94s)]
*  to get people off fossil fuels and natural gas and get them onto less dense, less reliable [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1372.6399999999999s)]
*  energy, including promoting things like organic farming in Sri Lanka, which we talked about [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1378.98s)]
*  on the show, caused their economy to collapse. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1383.62s)]
*  You've got the World Economic Forum promoting ideas like you're going to own nothing in [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1385.86s)]
*  the year 2030 and you're going to be eating insects because no one should be eating meat. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1390.1799999999998s)]
*  So you've got these wacky, extreme environmentalist ideas and anti-capitalist, anti-property ideas [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1395.02s)]
*  coming out of Davos. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1402.86s)]
*  So I think the whole thing's been a bit of a disaster. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1404.58s)]
*  For a brief moment, it looked like these people, again, were self-reflecting on their role [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1407.32s)]
*  in creating these disasters. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1412.26s)]
*  But of course, the tone quickly shifted to blaming disinformation on social media as [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1413.54s)]
*  the root cause of all these problems, as opposed to their decades of decision-making running [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1419.4199999999998s)]
*  the leading nations of the world and the leading companies of the world. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1425.1399999999999s)]
*  And I think that the blame is properly put not on social media, but on these leaders [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1428.3799999999999s)]
*  for making bad decisions. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1434.86s)]
*  Do you believe in the benefits of global trade, where countries trade with one another [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1437.38s)]
*  and shift the sourcing of supply and labor to the cheaper source so that the buyer can [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1442.18s)]
*  benefit from having things at a lower price and ultimately the global economy grows as [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1447.94s)]
*  kind of being beneficial to the US over the last 30 years or net negative? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1453.5s)]
*  Because we talked about the obvious consequences of global trade where we've had industries [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1459.0200000000002s)]
*  gutted in the United States and now we're trying to onshore them again and build redundancy [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1465.56s)]
*  and so on. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1469.8s)]
*  But that's becoming very expensive and ultimately leads to the inflation of goods and services. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1470.8s)]
*  And so as you look at kind of the positive agenda of the World Economic Forum over the [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1475.76s)]
*  last 30 years being about improving global trade and global relations to enable global [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1481.28s)]
*  trade, are you an anti-globalist? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1485.52s)]
*  And do you start to see yourself falling more in that camp as you see and hear more of what [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1487.84s)]
*  comes out of Davos and from these organizations like them? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1493.12s)]
*  Well look, all economic prosperity comes from trade. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1496.2s)]
*  If we didn't have trade, then we would all be subsistence farmers and hunters and gatherers. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1499.28s)]
*  So we basically specialize in something and then create an overabundance of that and trade [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1503.8799999999999s)]
*  it for the rest of our necessities. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1509.6399999999999s)]
*  The issue is that trade not only creates prosperity, it creates dependencies because you're dependent [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1511.76s)]
*  on the people you're trading with. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1517.6s)]
*  And also it has distributional effects in terms of geopolitical consequences. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1519.28s)]
*  So trade with China has created some prosperity, but it's also hollowed out the American manufacturing [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1524.06s)]
*  sector, while also making China very rich, which has basically turned China into a major [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1533.12s)]
*  geopolitical competitor for the United States. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1539.24s)]
*  So I'm not like a free trade fanatic. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1541.26s)]
*  I mean, I understand the ways that trade creates wealth, but I think it can also create these [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1543.84s)]
*  downsides that have to be managed. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1548.5s)]
*  And the fact of the matter is that this unfettered free trade ideology contained the seeds of [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1550.06s)]
*  its own destruction because all the revisionist powers who are seeking to revise the US-led [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1554.6200000000001s)]
*  global order, they were basically enriched and built up by the very free trade ideology [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1561.1000000000001s)]
*  that neoliberals were promoting. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1567.88s)]
*  So this neoliberal world order has kind of created the seeds of its own destruction. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1571.3600000000001s)]
*  I think that it would have been much smarter for us two decades ago to be much more restrained [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1576.4199999999998s)]
*  in the China trade and to not throw open our markets to Chinese products. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1582.22s)]
*  We basically gave them MFN status. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1587.22s)]
*  This is back in the early 2000s, and it was a bipartisan project and a bipartisan decision. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1589.4199999999998s)]
*  But the result of that has been the rapid rise of China at the expense of our manufacturing [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1595.58s)]
*  sectors. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1599.74s)]
*  And to the benefit of our consumer class, right? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1600.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, we do have $600 iPhones because of it, and we do have cheap TVs. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1602.3s)]
*  And there has been a consumer market that's demanded these low-priced goods to look at [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1606.3s)]
*  a better life, right? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1611.5s)]
*  Yeah, so everyone gets cheap goods at Target. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1612.5s)]
*  But in exchange for that, we now have a real peer competitor to the United States, which [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1615.06s)]
*  is capable of disrupting, let's say, our primacy in East Asia and is creating a much more [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1620.54s)]
*  challenging world. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1627.02s)]
*  So look, I can understand the reasons why people bought into this two decades ago, but [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1628.42s)]
*  I think that if we had it to do all over again, I think most people would recognize that we [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1632.94s)]
*  should not have given China permanent MFN status and we should have been more temperate [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1638.8200000000002s)]
*  in our willingness to throw open our markets to these countries. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1644.7s)]
*  Chamath, do you think that the World Economic Forum has kind of transitioned into this kind [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1648.38s)]
*  of neoliberal organization now that's promoting these neoliberal beliefs that aren't really [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1653.22s)]
*  tied to the original construct of global enabling and supporting global trade and supporting [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1659.1000000000001s)]
*  the global economy and creating more prosperity and security around the world? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1666.98s)]
*  I think it appeals to the insecure overachiever elite. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1669.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1673.7s)]
*  Now, nobody building anything really gives a shit about Davos. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1674.7s)]
*  Nobody is thinking what's going on. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1678.02s)]
*  Nobody even knows when it happens. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1679.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1681.22s)]
*  So who cares about it? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1682.42s)]
*  People who like status and went to fancy schools and wants to feel like they're in the club [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1683.6000000000001s)]
*  and that's how they've made it is going to this place, which underneath is a membership [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1689.3000000000002s)]
*  organization where people pay based on the number of people that get to go. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1695.42s)]
*  So is it really that important? [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1700.7s)]
*  Substantively no. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1703.5s)]
*  But overachieving surplus elites in the West really value the signal that it represents [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1705.42s)]
*  to other overachieving surplus elites in the West. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1710.62s)]
*  So that's what Davos is. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1714.58s)]
*  That's what the Allen and Company Conference has become. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1715.94s)]
*  A lot of these things started off much purer than what they are today, but these are all [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1718.34s)]
*  membership driven revenue generating efforts. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1723.86s)]
*  In 30 or 40 years, the All In Summit will probably become that too. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1729.58s)]
*  It's just the nature of things. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1734.84s)]
*  So I wouldn't spend so much time focused on a group of people getting together. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1736.66s)]
*  The funniest thing about Davos that I saw was Zero Hedge, which said that the amount [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1741.38s)]
*  of prostitution is at record levels in Davos. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1745.52s)]
*  And so it just kind of boils down to what it is, which is like any other conference. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1748.88s)]
*  It just happens to be with more security guards and less security guards. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1753.3000000000002s)]
*  And the same stupid stuff happens at Davos. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1757.48s)]
*  It happens in Vegas at Name Your Conference, CES. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1759.94s)]
*  It's just a different kind of attendee. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1764.18s)]
*  I think the bigger thing is that we are learning that the world tends to have these policy [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1766.68s)]
*  perspectives that swing in a pendulum. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1774.3600000000001s)]
*  And the problem with the pendulum is that it is at extremes. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1776.88s)]
*  And Sachs is right. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1780.24s)]
*  We went from an extreme where we were very closed off and we were essentially subsistence [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1781.66s)]
*  farmers, all of us were. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1787.92s)]
*  And then the pendulum has essentially peaked probably in the mid-teens of this decade or [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1789.92s)]
*  this century where we realized too much globalization actually hollows out local economies. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1795.12s)]
*  So we need to find the equilibrium point. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1800.3999999999999s)]
*  And that inherently has more inflation, that inherently has higher prices, and that inherently [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1802.72s)]
*  has slower progress, but more consistent progress that benefits more people. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1809.3s)]
*  And this is what is so ideologically disruptive to, again, surplus elites because they need [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1815.92s)]
*  the $600 iPhone. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1823.92s)]
*  The idea that they can't upgrade every year drives them into such a tizzy that they need [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1825.2s)]
*  to export all the jobs. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1831.24s)]
*  Whereas a $1,000 iPhone or a $1,500 iPhone may just mean that your upgrade cycle is two [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1833.6000000000001s)]
*  years and just ask yourself, how many times have you upgraded as soon as the phone came [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1840.52s)]
*  out to realize, man, this phone is actually worse than the previous version? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1846.0800000000002s)]
*  And it probably could have just waited. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1850.1200000000001s)]
*  And there's a lot of work that actually goes into building these things to actually make [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1852.48s)]
*  them better. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1855.32s)]
*  So all you're doing is you're giving up optionality, you're allowing your brothers and sisters [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1856.32s)]
*  to struggle to basically feed the profit motives of one company. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1859.94s)]
*  That in hindsight doesn't need to happen. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1864.2s)]
*  So there's an equilibrium. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1866.08s)]
*  And I think that these next few decades will be about finding it. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1867.08s)]
*  We have decided it's categorical that that level of globalization that we have had, this [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1871.92s)]
*  monocultural way of thinking about things is over. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1878.44s)]
*  And David's right. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1882.52s)]
*  It's because that system has created too many threats to the hegemony that brought us there. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1883.52s)]
*  And that's a good thing, I think, in general. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1890.3200000000002s)]
*  It'll be more prosperity for more people, but it'll be slower and it will create points [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1893.8400000000001s)]
*  of friction that are represented in inflation and higher prices. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1899.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1902.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1903.0s)]
*  You know, Chamath points out, like, if you're upgrading every two years instead of one year, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1904.24s)]
*  your economy doesn't grow as fast, you have less spending. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1908.12s)]
*  If the price of things go up, you have inflation. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1911.04s)]
*  The net cost of de-globalization is higher prices and lower economic growth. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1913.44s)]
*  That's just fundamental kind of macroeconomics. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1919.84s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1922.56s)]
*  That's not true, because the de-globalization in an individual economy will actually create [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1923.56s)]
*  GDP because you have to rebuild the things that you used to import. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1927.2s)]
*  That's right. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1931.2s)]
*  So, in a period of time, theoretically, you could catch up and accelerate. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1932.2s)]
*  But J. Cal, like, when you weigh this conversation about Davos and globalization and U.S. security [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1934.96s)]
*  against the one we just had, which is why I wanted to talk about this, we're running [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1942.28s)]
*  into a debt crisis. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1946.2s)]
*  We have limited spending capacity. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1948.5s)]
*  We have a significant amount of investment needed. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1950.56s)]
*  If we are going to cut global trade ties that we've depended on historically and start to [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1953.52s)]
*  build redundancy, can we afford this as a country? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1959.0s)]
*  Can the West afford this given the economic slowdowns and inflation right now? [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1962.56s)]
*  And how do we balance these conversations against our domestic challenges economically? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1967.12s)]
*  I think Davos has a pretty serious PR problem. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1973.04s)]
*  They have dubbed themselves essentially a self-appointed Illuminati for the rest of [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1976.2s)]
*  us and that they're going to set some global agenda. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1982.04s)]
*  I think this year's agenda was like finding the future or defining the future. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1985.48s)]
*  Nobody asked these people to be in charge. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1991.2800000000002s)]
*  And if you look at what's happened in the world, the chaos of COVID, and you look at [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1994.3600000000001s)]
*  what's happened in terms of energy policy in Europe, and then this obsession with social [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=1999.52s)]
*  issues and being told, you know, these farmers, these truckers, you're bad people, you're [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2005.2s)]
*  not woke, whatever it is. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2010.0800000000002s)]
*  I think the public looks at Davos as the manifestation of these global elites who are [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2011.92s)]
*  lording over them some master plan, whether it's real or not, that they're not part of [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2017.64s)]
*  and that doesn't take them into consideration and that takes into consideration only their [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2022.52s)]
*  profits. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2026.48s)]
*  And when you actually peel it back, as Chamath correctly pointed out, Davos is a huge grift. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2027.88s)]
*  They recruited me to be part of their world leaders 15 years ago after I sold my second [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2034.8400000000001s)]
*  company and I met Klaus, the guy who runs it at some New York Four Seasons event. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2040.76s)]
*  And then I got the bill. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2045.84s)]
*  And to be a world leader was forty fucking thousand dollars. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2048.44s)]
*  And I was like, what a global future leader. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2055.72s)]
*  I don't know what that means, but I'm not giving you forty thousand dollars. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2057.96s)]
*  And then you had to pay. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2061.96s)]
*  You had to pay to be a global, what a leader. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2063.92s)]
*  And you didn't have to pay for a six thousand dollar Ted ticket at the time. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2067.52s)]
*  This was forty large. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2071.32s)]
*  And I just thought, you know, this is not for me. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2074.76s)]
*  And I think people would much rather see some resiliency in the supply chain and they would [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2079.2000000000003s)]
*  rather see the origins of COVID and why we spent two years in a lockdown. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2086.56s)]
*  Was that a cover up of the United States funding, gain of research, you know, being done in [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2093.0s)]
*  Wuhan? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2102.16s)]
*  And why are we shutting down nuclear power plants? [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2103.7999999999997s)]
*  And what exactly is the energy policy in Germany? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2106.44s)]
*  People are looking at incompetent elites going to Davos, having a big party, and then setting [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2108.88s)]
*  an agenda for them that they don't understand or want. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2115.44s)]
*  And I think this is where, you know, the contempt for Davos is peaking this year. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2118.76s)]
*  And it should. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2124.5600000000004s)]
*  If you're being invited to Davos and other people are not being invited and they don't [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2125.5600000000004s)]
*  have a seat at the table and a voice at the table, you can tell that all the journalists [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2130.0s)]
*  there are on an access journalism pass. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2133.7000000000003s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2136.0s)]
*  Access journalism? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2137.0s)]
*  They get to come there and they get to hang out with elites if and only if their coverage [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2138.0s)]
*  fits a certain profile. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2143.44s)]
*  And if you find me the top 10 most critical anti-globalization journalists in the world, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2145.4s)]
*  I can guarantee you that they don't have credentials. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2151.1600000000003s)]
*  I think it's like a bankrupt organization that should just be shut down and the people [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2154.36s)]
*  who are going there are involved. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2157.44s)]
*  No, I think it's culturally bankrupt. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2159.48s)]
*  You guys have so much distinct. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2161.44s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2162.7200000000003s)]
*  No, I do. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2163.7200000000003s)]
*  I think it's not what the world wants right now. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2164.7200000000003s)]
*  The world wants transparency and the world wants ownership of all the screw ups, you [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2167.12s)]
*  know, from COVID to energy policy. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2173.92s)]
*  We want ownership of those issues, not a bunch of elites drinking champagne. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2177.0s)]
*  I'd rather spend a week with entrepreneurs or frankly spend a week with my kids or frankly [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2181.6s)]
*  spend a week playing poker with my friends. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2185.28s)]
*  Of course, let's do it. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2187.32s)]
*  There are like umpteen things that are above the list. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2188.32s)]
*  So it's kind of like let them get together. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2190.64s)]
*  I think it's fine for them to get together. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2192.32s)]
*  They should do it. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2193.88s)]
*  I just think that if you're not there, I would not weigh these things so heavily because [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2194.88s)]
*  it speaks more to your own insecurity than it does to their actual influence on things. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2198.44s)]
*  Yeah, the term elite is an interesting one. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2203.0800000000004s)]
*  Companies need a CEO to run the company. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2206.28s)]
*  It's not run by 10,000 employees and governments need a president to oversee the government. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2207.7200000000003s)]
*  And I think the idea that some small number of people that are in charge getting together [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2213.8s)]
*  is now being cast as an elite gathering and elitism in itself is the failure. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2218.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't think it's an elite gathering. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2225.32s)]
*  I think it's very important to get this nuance right. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2227.2000000000003s)]
*  It's a gathering of elites and that's very different than an elite gathering. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2229.2s)]
*  An elite gathering is when like Michael Jordan and LeBron James and Steph Curry get together [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2233.3999999999996s)]
*  and work on their basketball game. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2238.2799999999997s)]
*  That's an elite gathering. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2239.8799999999997s)]
*  A gathering of elites is what's happening in Davos. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2241.68s)]
*  That's fair point. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2245.64s)]
*  But they are the presidents of their companies and the presidents of their countries. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2247.12s)]
*  So I would differentiate between the people who are merely attending who are paying the [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2250.2799999999997s)]
*  $40,000, who are probably a bunch of hangers on. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2254.12s)]
*  It's now $250,000 by the way. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2257.6s)]
*  $250,000. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2259.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, anyone willing to pay that is like, you know, totally an insecure, you know, surplus [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2260.3199999999997s)]
*  elite. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2266.08s)]
*  By the way, I just got back from Davos. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2267.08s)]
*  Oh, you did? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2268.08s)]
*  Okay, well, congratulations. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2269.08s)]
*  Looks good on you though. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2270.08s)]
*  Right, go ahead. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2271.08s)]
*  Looks good on you. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2272.08s)]
*  Did you spend your own money or your LP's money? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2273.08s)]
*  No, I didn't go to Davos. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2276.08s)]
*  Oh my lord. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2277.08s)]
*  Find me one person that went to Davos that spent their own money. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2278.08s)]
*  It's like probably none. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2282.08s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2283.08s)]
*  The hangers on who are spending $250,000 to feel important, but then there's the people [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2284.56s)]
*  who are invited who probably don't spend any money, who are basically speaking, right? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2288.68s)]
*  And you got to say that the group of people who are speaking at Davos individually and [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2293.04s)]
*  collectively are quite influential. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2298.56s)]
*  They are the leaders of countries and Fortune 500 companies. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2301.0s)]
*  Sure, but you can agree that they literally don't say anything that's noteworthy because [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2305.92s)]
*  they're not allowed to. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2309.92s)]
*  They're not saying anything that's that different of what they would say the previous week or [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2310.92s)]
*  the following week. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2313.6s)]
*  It's a forum. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2314.6s)]
*  It's a platform for getting amplification. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2315.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's a forum for all these people to get together. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2316.6s)]
*  Look, in terms of the critique of it, Freberg, you asked how far back does this go? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2321.12s)]
*  This is not like a new thing. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2326.96s)]
*  The term Davos man was coined back in 2004 by a Harvard professor named Sam Huntington [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2329.48s)]
*  who wrote a book called Class Civilizations. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2336.04s)]
*  He's the professor of international relations at Harvard. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2337.6s)]
*  And he coined the term Davos man to refer to a globalist who, quote, had little need [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2341.44s)]
*  for national loyalty, who viewed national boundaries as obstacles that are thankfully [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2347.44s)]
*  vanishing. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2351.8s)]
*  That's how Huntington defined Davos man. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2353.0s)]
*  And there's been a reaction to these Davos men that's been growing for a couple of decades. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2356.16s)]
*  I mean, obviously, the election of Trump was a reaction to that. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2362.32s)]
*  Brexit was a huge reaction to that. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2367.04s)]
*  And I think that the resistance to the imposition of their, again, their globalist policies, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2370.0s)]
*  which I guess you could define as believing in this borderless world economically and [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2376.56s)]
*  politically, I think that's been receding in favor of more nationalist leaders who want [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2381.52s)]
*  to promote their own country's interests. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2386.88s)]
*  And I think that trend is going to continue. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2389.28s)]
*  Well, Chamath, let's transition this to the broader question that I think we got into [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2391.28s)]
*  it a couple episodes ago on how can we afford this transition if there is this mounting [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2396.88s)]
*  kind of trend against globalization, this mounting de-globalization movement and effort, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2406.88s)]
*  particularly in the US. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2411.6800000000003s)]
*  And again, as Sax pointed out, global debt to GDP is something like 300 to 350 percent, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2412.6800000000003s)]
*  depending on how you count. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2418.1200000000003s)]
*  And we're running into a debt ceiling here in the US. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2420.6000000000004s)]
*  I guess the question is, how do we afford to build the infrastructure redundancy and [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2424.2s)]
*  make the investments at home to replace global trade? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2428.96s)]
*  Can we afford to do it? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2432.96s)]
*  And how's this going to play out as we run into this debt ceiling vote? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2433.96s)]
*  I don't think that's the right question. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2437.8799999999997s)]
*  I think it's the inverse of that question. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2439.12s)]
*  How can we afford not to? [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2440.8599999999997s)]
*  With the amount of discontent and the amount of economic strain that people feel, if you [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2442.92s)]
*  want to really quell populism, you're going to have to create economic vibrancy at home. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2449.04s)]
*  When people are making money and they find purpose, they're less agitated. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2453.78s)]
*  They're not storming the Capitol. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2458.7000000000003s)]
*  They're not electing fringe candidates. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2460.0600000000004s)]
*  They're not doing domestic terrorism. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2463.26s)]
*  They're just going to work and building a life. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2465.6200000000003s)]
*  We know that. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2468.34s)]
*  So how can we afford not to? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2469.34s)]
*  How can we afford not to bring back jobs to the heartland of America? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2471.0s)]
*  So the reality that I have, and I think a lot of people have, is that this debt to GDP [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2475.42s)]
*  is a bit of an intellectual red herring. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2481.54s)]
*  And the reason is people talk about this thing constantly in these absolute terms with no [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2485.1000000000004s)]
*  historical precedent that relates well to our current moment. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2490.6600000000003s)]
*  There is no magic number at which thing this experiment that's called America fails. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2494.86s)]
*  So I think that you have to be a little bit more intellectually honest and say that at [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2500.86s)]
*  best it's a relative problem. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2504.26s)]
*  And it's relative to the countries that have already established dominance, of which there [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2506.78s)]
*  are eight or nine, and then the emerging economies, and then thinking about what critical things [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2512.0600000000004s)]
*  will they bring to the table in 15 or 20 years from now. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2517.9s)]
*  And in that context, I think that people will him and Ha, but ultimately they'll capitulate. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2521.2200000000003s)]
*  They will raise the debt ceiling and they'll continue to fund this transition away from [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2527.44s)]
*  globalism. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2532.42s)]
*  I think that's the argument that will get the Republicans over the line, because it's [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2533.58s)]
*  going to bring a lot of spending and stimulus and jobs to frankly a lot of red states that [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2537.1800000000003s)]
*  would otherwise kind of continue to wither and die on the vine. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2543.62s)]
*  I think here's my biggest concern. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2546.62s)]
*  We're either trying to walk a tightrope or there's no tightrope to walk. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2549.38s)]
*  And if we make these investments and they're not economically viable investments, it's [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2554.06s)]
*  a path to ruin. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2561.02s)]
*  And what I mean by that is if we're building factories, manufacturing facilities, infrastructure [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2563.26s)]
*  that relies on yesteryears technology and systems of production and glow and kind of [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2569.44s)]
*  economic systems, and there are alternatives that are competing on a global stage that [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2575.5400000000004s)]
*  are better, more productive, more advanced, then we lose. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2580.2200000000003s)]
*  And we've made an investment in a negative ROI way. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2584.5s)]
*  But hold on a second, can I ask you a question? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2587.5400000000004s)]
*  See, when you say that, though, you're making a very basic assumption, which I think you [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2590.66s)]
*  can question, which is you are underpinning that on fundamental economics that can change [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2594.2999999999997s)]
*  if we choose to. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2600.1s)]
*  For example, let's take like natural resources. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2601.1s)]
*  Every time you do a plan, the industry, and I define the industry as every for profit [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2604.7799999999997s)]
*  company and Wall Street and the debt markets, they refuse to underwrite this thing at a [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2609.38s)]
*  higher cost of capital. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2614.94s)]
*  They use a whack of six or seven or eight, and they will fight tooth and nail to use [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2616.1s)]
*  the smallest discount rate possible because it allows them to capture more of the profit [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2622.1s)]
*  dollars. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2627.14s)]
*  But if you actually had a realistic whack of like 10% on a massive infrastructure project, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2628.54s)]
*  guess what? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2634.9s)]
*  You're actually pretty equivalent to a government. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2636.06s)]
*  And in fact, in many cases, a government becomes cheaper. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2638.7s)]
*  So I think the thing that is worth debating, and I'd like your reaction to this, it's not [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2641.7799999999997s)]
*  about what you're saying. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2645.74s)]
*  It's we refuse to change the guardrails on our profit making ability. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2646.74s)]
*  And if you extended the window, if you change the discount rate, if you said PEs can be [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2652.1s)]
*  different, you would have a very different economic justification for what you just said. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2656.2599999999998s)]
*  It completely changes a hundred basis points, changes everything you're saying by tens of [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2659.18s)]
*  years. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2664.38s)]
*  One way to describe that is another way to reframe what you just said is that the useful [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2665.38s)]
*  lifespan of an investment isn't 40 years or 50 years, but it may be 12 years. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2671.42s)]
*  And if you if you recast the investment decision as this has to be a 12 year return instead [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2676.9s)]
*  of allowing it to be modeled as a 40 year return, then you start to really filter out [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2682.7400000000002s)]
*  a lot of the nonsense and you can actually see real payback. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2687.46s)]
*  It doesn't make sense to spend a hundred billion dollars on a train to take people from L.A. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2690.46s)]
*  to Fresno or whatever craziness the California high speed rail program has turned into. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2696.1400000000003s)]
*  It was originally like a billion dollars to go from L.A. to San Francisco. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2701.7000000000003s)]
*  There was economic justification to get payback on a hundred billion dollars or whatever it's [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2705.7400000000002s)]
*  ballooned into. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2709.76s)]
*  The whole system should be shut down. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2711.6200000000003s)]
*  So I guess there's a from a policy perspective and accountability framing that's missing, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2713.7400000000002s)]
*  but also bringing in the time horizon on which we need to get paid back for these things. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2718.54s)]
*  My point was that in China, and I've made this point many times, but I just think it's [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2723.84s)]
*  a really important one that'll play out over the next couple of years. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2728.1000000000004s)]
*  They're building 450 nuclear power plants. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2731.26s)]
*  They're going to get the cost of industrial power below five cents or four cents a kilowatt [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2733.38s)]
*  hour and they're electrifying all their factories. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2736.82s)]
*  As they do that, it's no longer a unit of human labor that's needed to produce goods. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2739.6600000000003s)]
*  It's a unit of electricity. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2744.0600000000004s)]
*  And if they're driving down the cost of electricity and all products can be made using electricity, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2745.82s)]
*  you have a huge economic advantage. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2751.1400000000003s)]
*  It's not the cure all that you think that is. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2752.6800000000003s)]
*  Even if you have free energy, you have to think about the inputs and the thing that [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2754.6800000000003s)]
*  China. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2758.2200000000003s)]
*  But no, sorry, I'm not talking about energy. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2759.2200000000003s)]
*  I'm just saying a general framing like. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2760.5s)]
*  No, I understand. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2762.22s)]
*  My point being like the investments we should be making are where is the puck headed, not [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2763.54s)]
*  where has the puck been? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2768.34s)]
*  No, no. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2769.42s)]
*  So I just wanted to comment on where the puck is heading. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2770.42s)]
*  Even if energy is zero in China, you have to think about inputs, meaning factories make [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2772.16s)]
*  things with inputs. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2776.54s)]
*  And if you look, for example, in natural resources, the inputs by and large don't exist in China. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2778.42s)]
*  And so all I'm saying is that all of these inputs, whether again, you can take natural [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2784.7s)]
*  resources that proliferate massively in the United States, it turns out that India is [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2789.5s)]
*  utterly, utterly, utterly poorly addressed in a geographical survey perspective. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2794.58s)]
*  And we're finding that India's raw resources are off the charts. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2799.54s)]
*  Okay, there are certain places in Africa, tons of stuff in Indonesia and Australia. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2803.62s)]
*  All of those things may not have to go to China because there are subsidies or there [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2809.3s)]
*  are equivalently cheaper decisions that governments can make so that they choose not to send it. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2814.94s)]
*  And all of a sudden, all of that spending doesn't matter as much because the Australian [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2820.06s)]
*  government makes a trade off that says, you know what, I'd rather have these jobs here [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2824.98s)]
*  and I'm willing to have a longer payback cycle for these jobs to be here than instead of [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2829.54s)]
*  ship it to China. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2833.4s)]
*  And they tell the Australian citizens, I'm sorry, guys, but you're going to have to replace [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2835.2200000000003s)]
*  your car every seven years as opposed to every five. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2839.46s)]
*  I hope you're okay with that, but that'll mean full employment and it'll prevent fringe [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2842.7s)]
*  candidates and populism. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2847.06s)]
*  And let's go forward. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2849.54s)]
*  Where do you invest? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2850.8199999999997s)]
*  I am investing a lot of money in those places that control the natural resources that are [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2853.22s)]
*  poorly understood, meaning there are places like India where our geological survey capacity [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2862.54s)]
*  is relatively naive. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2870.8599999999997s)]
*  And it turns out that in critical parts of the energy supply chain or other places, they [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2872.58s)]
*  can play a huge role. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2880.4599999999996s)]
*  And the Indian government's cost of capital has an element, they're sophisticated enough [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2882.4599999999996s)]
*  to add an element to the formula that accounts for full employment. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2888.8199999999997s)]
*  If I build it in this state, and if I try to get this many jobs created, the full circle [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2894.34s)]
*  feedback of that allows me to actually transfer price it into the Indian market at this price, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2900.78s)]
*  which is cheaper than anything that China can do, even at zero energy. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2906.1800000000003s)]
*  That's the kind of sophisticated decision making that is emerging because of this deglobalization [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2911.46s)]
*  trend and it's happening everywhere. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2915.7400000000002s)]
*  So the Indians are doing it, the Germans are doing it, and then the US is doing it. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2917.6600000000003s)]
*  And then on top of that, what they're doing in terms of game theory, which I think is [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2922.1s)]
*  even more sophisticated is they're not letting China be alone, they're actually now slowing [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2926.06s)]
*  China down. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2930.94s)]
*  Because China turns out actually needs inputs from these Western economies and they're like, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2932.7s)]
*  we're just not going to give them to you anymore, so do the best you can. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2936.98s)]
*  For example, in semiconductors, the Dutch, the Germans, the Americans, we've now essentially [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2939.66s)]
*  embargoed all of our most sophisticated equipment from ever getting in there. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2944.18s)]
*  That will increase, even with zero energy, the cost of what comes out of there. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2948.3s)]
*  And that will balance the playing field so that the Germans, the Dutch, the Americans [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2953.2200000000003s)]
*  can bring other partners in at a different cost of capital to make it economically neutral [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2958.5800000000004s)]
*  and at parity. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2964.6000000000004s)]
*  And the reason they'll do it is to create jobs for Americans or the Dutch or for the [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2965.6600000000003s)]
*  Germans. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2970.0600000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2971.0600000000004s)]
*  I think the most important thing here isn't like energy. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2972.0600000000004s)]
*  I don't think it's infrastructure. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2977.42s)]
*  I don't think it's natural resources, at least for America. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2979.38s)]
*  It's entrepreneurs. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2982.1800000000003s)]
*  And that's what it's always been for this country. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2983.6600000000003s)]
*  And it's immigration is the silver bullet here and inspiration and the freedom that [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2986.3s)]
*  this country has for entrepreneurs and founders to pursue a vision to start a company. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2991.94s)]
*  That's why we've won so big historically is the combination of immigration and the inspiration [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=2998.44s)]
*  that these entrepreneurs do on a global basis to get more entrepreneurs to come to this [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3004.7s)]
*  country to go to Stanford, to start companies. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3009.7s)]
*  And that's why China is now losing. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3013.38s)]
*  They cribbed this incredible formula we had of letting Jack Ma do Alibaba. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3015.9s)]
*  And then they decided to for whatever, you know, insecure or stupid reason or pragmatic [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3022.1s)]
*  reason to consolidate power. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3027.46s)]
*  And that's what will push the world forward and make our country thrive. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3030.14s)]
*  We have to fix immigration. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3034.8199999999997s)]
*  We have to keep letting entrepreneurs define the future because the government can do so [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3036.14s)]
*  much. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3041.22s)]
*  They can underwrite a couple of chip factories here or there. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3042.22s)]
*  Sure we could put money into nuclear or fission or fusion and whatever the next technology [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3045.3399999999997s)]
*  is. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3050.22s)]
*  But you need a singular person who wants to make it their life's mission, who wants to [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3051.22s)]
*  have their sense of pride and innovation push the world forward. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3054.98s)]
*  And those people are rare. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3059.98s)]
*  And we are in a competition globally that we are not focused on, that we need to get [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3061.82s)]
*  refocused on to recruit the greatest minds in the world who want to change the world [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3067.38s)]
*  to do it on American soil. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3072.02s)]
*  I do not disagree with you, J. Cal. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3074.46s)]
*  I think, you know, to my earlier comment about how do we walk the tightrope of the debt burden, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3076.06s)]
*  the de-globalization and populism movements and the challenges and opportunities ahead, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3081.3s)]
*  it has to come through innovation. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3086.7000000000003s)]
*  I think that's how you have to invent a new tightrope, basically. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3087.82s)]
*  I think the challenge though is, Freeberg, that it takes a recognition that there are [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3091.0600000000004s)]
*  singular individuals in the world, one in a million, one in 10 million, one in 100,000, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3096.54s)]
*  whatever it is, who can just drive an entire economy forward. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3101.7400000000002s)]
*  Whether it's Gates with Microsoft or Steve Jobs with Apple, there are singular individuals [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3106.54s)]
*  who come to this country, bam bam Brogan with the tunneling company. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3111.94s)]
*  Nice, Paul. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3117.42s)]
*  Nobody knows what you're talking about except for me. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3120.58s)]
*  There are people who will push these things forward and take risks. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3123.98s)]
*  And we have to recognize that it's a small number of individuals backed by a large amount [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3127.34s)]
*  of capital that create massive jobs and great prosperity. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3133.22s)]
*  It's an uncomfortable conversation for people to realize that it might just be a couple [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3137.54s)]
*  of dozen people a year immigrating to this country that change the fate of this country. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3141.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3146.74s)]
*  Why do you need to allow 3 million migrants to stream across the southern border every [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3147.74s)]
*  year? [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3151.74s)]
*  Because you don't know which one it's going to be. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3152.74s)]
*  That's why. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3155.2599999999998s)]
*  Really? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3156.2599999999998s)]
*  That's your immigration policy is open border. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3157.2599999999998s)]
*  So that one in a million. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3159.58s)]
*  I said recruitment. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3160.58s)]
*  That's how you're recruiting. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3162.42s)]
*  So you're immigrating. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3163.98s)]
*  Yeah, you're immigrating. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3164.98s)]
*  I can explain that. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3165.98s)]
*  It's a great question, Sax. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3166.98s)]
*  There are two things to look at here. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3168.54s)]
*  There is pragmatic. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3169.98s)]
*  Hold on, let me finish my sentence. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3170.98s)]
*  No, I was just going to ask you to just clarify as you say. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3172.2599999999998s)]
*  Are you saying that the PhD student that starts Google is streaming across the border or actually [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3175.5s)]
*  applying for? [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3179.42s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3180.42s)]
*  And each one of them is like, Elon, apply to go to college here. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3181.42s)]
*  Let me parse it for you. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3185.42s)]
*  There's immigration and then there's recruitment. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3187.1s)]
*  And if we frame this process with those two different words, there are people who are, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3189.3s)]
*  yes, immigrating streaming across the border, however you want to frame it, Sax. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3194.86s)]
*  I don't look at it in a political way. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3198.1400000000003s)]
*  And then there's recruiting the most elite talent in the world. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3200.9s)]
*  We can do both of these things. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3203.86s)]
*  One of them, you know, helps farmers have people to work the fields, to have people [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3206.2200000000003s)]
*  take entry level jobs, to work in the service industry. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3212.6000000000004s)]
*  We should bring in two or three million of those people per year. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3215.7000000000003s)]
*  We should make it legal and we should celebrate it because we have so many of those positions [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3218.68s)]
*  open that Americans don't want to take. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3222.8399999999997s)]
*  We should then also in parallel and without confusing the issue for political reasons, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3224.68s)]
*  recruit people to come to our universities and when they graduate, have their citizenship [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3231.7799999999997s)]
*  stapled to that diploma and not let them leave the country and let them start companies here. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3236.96s)]
*  Instead, what we do is we make them fight to stay here. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3242.68s)]
*  We should be recruiting the smartest, most talented people. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3246.32s)]
*  That will be hundreds of thousands of people per year, well, hundreds of thousands. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3249.42s)]
*  Okay, Sax, your response? [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3252.0800000000004s)]
*  And then we should have millions coming across the border. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3253.0800000000004s)]
*  Sick J. Cal is very reasonable, no? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3254.6200000000003s)]
*  Sick J. Cal is great. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3256.42s)]
*  Yeah, I think that... [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3257.92s)]
*  He's so much better when you have him moderate. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3258.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3260.92s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead, Sax. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3261.92s)]
*  You know, I'm an immigrant. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3262.92s)]
*  You know, my dad came over in 1977 when I was five years old. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3265.8s)]
*  Of course, he had an MD. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3271.7200000000003s)]
*  He was a doctor. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3274.04s)]
*  He actually had like skills and wasn't immediately going to become a net government dependent. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3275.24s)]
*  So I think that it makes sense to allow immigrants who can actually add something into our economy [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3280.52s)]
*  and bring skills and all the rest of it. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3285.74s)]
*  But the problem we have is that if you want to take that reasonable position, you're told [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3287.68s)]
*  that you basically have to accept a situation of de facto open borders, which is ridiculous. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3291.7s)]
*  No, you don't. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3297.3599999999997s)]
*  No, you don't. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3298.3599999999997s)]
*  These are two separate things and I'll just say your party... [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3299.3599999999997s)]
*  They've become conflated. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3301.3599999999997s)]
*  They are. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3302.3599999999997s)]
*  So it's the number one party that conflates these two issues. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3303.48s)]
*  You know they're two separate issues. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3307.0s)]
*  No, the Democratic Party has conflated these issues. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3308.0s)]
*  Okay, both parties are conflating them. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3310.0s)]
*  Here at the All In Podcast, can we agree that one group of people could recruit people for [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3311.6800000000003s)]
*  PhD programs while one group of people allows people across the border to take service jobs? [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3317.08s)]
*  Yes, obviously the more nuanced policy is the way to go. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3321.56s)]
*  But look, let me tie this back to Davos Man. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3324.6s)]
*  What was the definition of Davos Man? [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3327.08s)]
*  It was somebody who is pushing this ideology of free trade and open borders to such an [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3328.68s)]
*  extent that it creates a nationalist backlash or populist backlash. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3334.3599999999997s)]
*  That's exactly what's happened at our southern border is you have the people who believe [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3339.7599999999998s)]
*  in immigration push that ideology to such an extent that they won't create a rational, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3344.68s)]
*  sensible southern border and process our southern border. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3350.24s)]
*  It's chaos down there. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3353.74s)]
*  And the response is that the response... [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3355.24s)]
*  I'm in favor of bringing in the dream team. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3356.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I'm in favor of bringing in the dream team. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3357.7999999999997s)]
*  But the response of open borders is the creation of this nationalist movement, right? [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3360.0s)]
*  The nationalist movement only exists in the face of open borders. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3364.4399999999996s)]
*  I think that's the point, right? [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3367.7599999999998s)]
*  Like the extreme bears the extreme. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3369.08s)]
*  I think the immigration system should be based on points just like Canada. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3372.6s)]
*  If the Davos men don't start taking into account these national considerations around the [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3377.2799999999997s)]
*  defense of their borders and these issues around trade hollowing out the middle class, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3384.16s)]
*  then there's going to be an intense backlash. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3390.08s)]
*  And I don't think those elites have been managing the situation very well. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3392.16s)]
*  It would have been better for them to pursue the more nuanced policy you're talking about. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3395.08s)]
*  Why are we conflating the issue then? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3399.0s)]
*  Why do the Democrats and the Republicans, SACs, make this such a polarizing issue instead [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3400.7999999999997s)]
*  of stating it the way I did? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3405.0s)]
*  Oh my God, it's so easy. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3407.0s)]
*  And the southern border, it's so easy to separate them. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3408.0s)]
*  You know, when you conflate them, you can incite an emotional response from your voting [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3411.44s)]
*  base. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3416.44s)]
*  That's it. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3417.44s)]
*  That's why all of these issues get based out. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3418.44s)]
*  They get based out to the point that then you can drive someone to vote for you because [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3421.2799999999997s)]
*  you've now framed the other side as this extreme side. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3425.4s)]
*  Yeah, J. Cal, you earlier said, hold on, before you got suddenly very reasonable, you said [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3428.12s)]
*  that we had to allow two to three... [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3432.88s)]
*  I've always been this reason where you haven't listened. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3433.88s)]
*  I'm going to quote something you just said a minute ago. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3436.4s)]
*  You said that we had to allow two to three million completely destitute, practically [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3438.72s)]
*  illiterate migrants to stream across our border because one in a million of them might be [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3444.64s)]
*  an Elon Musk. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3448.8799999999997s)]
*  No, no, there could be... [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3449.8799999999997s)]
*  You said that. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3450.8799999999997s)]
*  No, no, hold on. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3451.8799999999997s)]
*  I was talking about the border. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3452.8799999999997s)]
*  You can take it back, J. Cal. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3453.8799999999997s)]
*  No, no, I'm not. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3454.8799999999997s)]
*  Immigration typically includes, when you say that word, the corpus of people coming in [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3455.8799999999997s)]
*  for education and the people coming across the southern border. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3460.2s)]
*  So if you were to say immigration, most people would reasonably say that's both of those [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3462.8199999999997s)]
*  buckets. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3466.3599999999997s)]
*  We've operated them out here so we can have a reasonable discussion. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3467.6s)]
*  Recruitment of higher education, talented people with low education migrant workers. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3470.1600000000003s)]
*  They are two different buckets. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3478.1200000000003s)]
*  And you have to be able to say these are two different buckets and that we should have [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3479.52s)]
*  a point-based system. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3483.6400000000003s)]
*  This is the conversation that doesn't happen amongst politicians, but can happen here. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3485.52s)]
*  Look at Canada, look at Australia. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3489.2000000000003s)]
*  They have what's called a point-based immigration system. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3490.84s)]
*  They give you points for everything that you bring to the country. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3493.2000000000003s)]
*  If you bring money, if you speak the native language, if you have a degree, if you have [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3496.92s)]
*  a higher education degree, or you have skills that that country needs, our country needs [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3500.88s)]
*  to move to a point-based system. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3505.92s)]
*  If you're coming across the border and you don't speak the language and you don't have [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3507.88s)]
*  an education, you have zero points. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3510.12s)]
*  If you have a master's degree and you speak the language, you have two or three points [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3512.56s)]
*  and you can let in buckets of people based on compassion, based on needing service workers [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3515.7200000000003s)]
*  and based on needing the next Elon Musk or the next David Sacks or Chamath Palihapitiya. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3520.96s)]
*  I think the argument, J. Cal, is that the compassion argument falls on deaf ears in [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3526.36s)]
*  a time where people feel we cannot afford it and it's a luxury to embrace that model [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3531.6400000000003s)]
*  of immigration right now. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3536.1200000000003s)]
*  Just pick a number we can reasonably absorb. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3537.32s)]
*  This is what Finland did. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3539.3s)]
*  People look at the southern border and seek chaos. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3540.3s)]
*  Obviously they want to get that under control before they're going to adopt your point-based [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3543.1600000000003s)]
*  system that they don't trust. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3547.32s)]
*  We could do two things at once. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3548.32s)]
*  We could do... [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3549.32s)]
*  No, the point-based system would solve the whole problem. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3550.32s)]
*  No, first get the southern border under control. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3551.32s)]
*  Are you opposed to the point-based system? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3552.32s)]
*  No, I like the idea of... [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3553.32s)]
*  I don't know if my point is going to be the same as your point's, but in concept I like [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3554.7200000000003s)]
*  the idea... [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3557.56s)]
*  Define your points. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3558.56s)]
*  No, no, we don't need to. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3559.56s)]
*  I like the idea of admitting immigrants based on skills the country actually needs and a [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3560.56s)]
*  simple recognition that is better to bring in people who are immediately productive, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3565.0800000000004s)]
*  hold on, and can add to our economy as opposed to being net government recipients, dependents. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3568.56s)]
*  We're done. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3573.56s)]
*  We're done. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3574.56s)]
*  There are countries, I just want to make a point, there are countries, the Scandinavian [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3575.56s)]
*  countries specifically, that have said we can accept up to this many folks who are uneducated, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3577.84s)]
*  who don't speak the language because we have this many teachers and this many slots in [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3584.16s)]
*  school. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3587.88s)]
*  And so, if anything, it was Finland and Sweden, they said we can accept 50,000 per year of [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3588.88s)]
*  this type of immigration based on compassion. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3593.44s)]
*  That's the reasonable discussion that has to happen here. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3596.48s)]
*  But, Jacob, did you just say that we have to do these two things at the same time, meaning [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3598.3199999999997s)]
*  that until we impose an overhaul of our entire immigration system to be based on skills and [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3602.2s)]
*  points that we can't enforce the southern border? [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3608.3199999999997s)]
*  No, I think you can enforce the southern border and do it. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3611.24s)]
*  I think you can do these things at the same time. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3613.68s)]
*  It's not wrong, guys. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3615.6s)]
*  Canada's doing it. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3616.6s)]
*  Let me just tell you, there's going to be no wrong. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3617.6s)]
*  Guys, I've got to move us. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3618.6s)]
*  Canada and Australia are already doing it. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3619.6s)]
*  Let me just tell you, there's not going to be a broad based constituency in this country [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3621.08s)]
*  for the type of immigration reform you're talking about until you get the southern border [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3623.96s)]
*  under control because people look at that on the news and see chaos. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3627.8799999999997s)]
*  And there's no excuse for that. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3631.96s)]
*  They should be thoughtful. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3632.96s)]
*  They should be thoughtful. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3633.96s)]
*  And they should just look at what Canada and Australia have done. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3634.96s)]
*  Those countries have actually controlled this and it's not a polarizing issue there. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3637.4s)]
*  It's a pragmatic issue. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3641.52s)]
*  OK, guys, I'm going to move us forward to the the banning of TikTok. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3642.7599999999998s)]
*  So I want to kind of change the tone a little bit. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3648.2s)]
*  This story recently is that TikTok has been banned for use on the campus Wi-Fi network. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3652.16s)]
*  Let's go. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3660.32s)]
*  At a number of universities, including UT Austin, Auburn, Boise State, the University [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3661.32s)]
*  of Oklahoma. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3665.44s)]
*  So college students can't access the app when they're on the campus network. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3666.44s)]
*  This is following 19 states that recently banned TikTok and government devices. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3670.32s)]
*  As everyone knows, TikTok is a product from ByteDance, which is a Chinese based company. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3674.6400000000003s)]
*  And there's been quite a lot of political and regulatory huffs and gruffs about ByteDance [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3680.6800000000003s)]
*  having this level of insight and access to users in the United States, with the assumption [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3687.36s)]
*  being that much of the data that they're pulling out of the app is available to the Chinese [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3693.52s)]
*  Communist Party, which creates a security threat to the United States. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3698.16s)]
*  That's one argument. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3704.56s)]
*  I think there is also a significant tie in to ByteDance. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3707.04s)]
*  There's over eight billion dollars of capital invested in ByteDance by firms that we know [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3711.48s)]
*  well like Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, Co2, Susquehanna and others. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3715.68s)]
*  They're trying to find a way to monetize their investment in what is truly the most viral, [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3720.56s)]
*  fastest growing, highest revenue growing, biggest startup in the world right now in [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3725.12s)]
*  ByteDance. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3730.0s)]
*  So there is a restructuring proposal apparently underway that's being discussed in Washington, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3731.0s)]
*  D.C. right now to try and restructure the organization and the ownership structure and [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3734.7999999999997s)]
*  the oversight of TikTok and ByteDance such that U.S. regulators and U.S. companies can [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3739.16s)]
*  oversee the data, the use of the data, the algorithms underlying TikTok and monitor them [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3744.92s)]
*  from within the United States. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3750.04s)]
*  The question for this group here on the McLaughlin group of 2023 is, does that do enough for [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3751.92s)]
*  you? [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3757.96s)]
*  McLaughlin, do you guys think that that's enough? [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3758.96s)]
*  First up is Jamath, who's been silenced for a bit. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3762.16s)]
*  I think this is really bad news for ByteDance. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3765.0s)]
*  Basically what's happening is that, and TikTok, all the frustration that all these legislators [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3767.2000000000003s)]
*  had over Facebook and Google and other sort of big tech companies is going to get focused [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3774.76s)]
*  on ByteDance because you have this common enemy that you can point to as a boogeyman [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3783.6800000000003s)]
*  of sorts. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3787.96s)]
*  And I'm not saying that it's right, but I think that what you're starting to see is [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3788.96s)]
*  it's much easier to pick a fight with a Chinese company and win and get broad-based support [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3792.1600000000003s)]
*  than it is to pick a fight against an American company with a bunch of American employees [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3798.76s)]
*  and American market cap and American know-how and American IP that gets impacted. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3803.5s)]
*  So I don't think this is going to end well for TikTok. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3808.7s)]
*  And I think the goal, if I were any of these people on the cap table, would be to sell [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3813.3s)]
*  it in secondary to somebody else and get out. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3818.82s)]
*  I think the next big shoe to drop is going to be advertisers who come under a lot of [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3822.62s)]
*  pressure. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3829.34s)]
*  So for example, think of all the advertisers that have left Twitter. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3831.02s)]
*  There is a point of efficiency where you can live with all of the mess that Twitter has [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3834.5s)]
*  because it comes with a lot less scrutiny and oversight and political pressure than [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3839.82s)]
*  advertising on TikTok. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3843.02s)]
*  And that, I think, is the next kind of like big wave here. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3844.94s)]
*  So I think it's very, very bad. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3848.2200000000003s)]
*  I think the enterprise value of this company is quite challenged. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3849.82s)]
*  And these guys should try to sell and get out. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3854.94s)]
*  Who are the buyers in that secondary market, though? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3858.22s)]
*  I mean, that's a lot of capital. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3860.8199999999997s)]
*  The thing is, the cap tables haven't been segregated. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3862.22s)]
*  So what you own is equity and bite dance. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3864.62s)]
*  But the problem is the look-through ownership will discount a lot of TikTok if they see [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3867.8199999999997s)]
*  a lot more of this stuff happening. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3872.8999999999996s)]
*  You guys have to remember, this is the first three or four weeks of 2023. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3874.3399999999997s)]
*  Wait till we're here in September and October and November. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3878.3399999999997s)]
*  Wait till the election year starts. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3880.8599999999997s)]
*  It's not good. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3884.1s)]
*  So it's a discount on bite dance. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3885.14s)]
*  That probably takes bite dance down by 70 or 80 billion. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3887.9s)]
*  So that's a 35, 40% discount to their last mark. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3892.1800000000003s)]
*  So you know, if somebody can sell in the high hundred billions of dollars, I think they [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3897.34s)]
*  should consider it. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3900.7000000000003s)]
*  It's worth it, I think. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3903.5s)]
*  J. Cal, I know you've got strong opinions on TikTok. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3904.5s)]
*  Well, I think you have to be incredibly pragmatic here. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3906.5s)]
*  This is the same as the 5G issue. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3909.36s)]
*  You cannot trust the Chinese government to not steal intellectual property or to put [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3911.1800000000003s)]
*  back doors into the software. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3916.1800000000003s)]
*  It is common business practice there. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3917.66s)]
*  Huawei was banned. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3920.1s)]
*  They basically stole the source code from Cisco. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3921.46s)]
*  That was proven. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3923.66s)]
*  And it was proven that they were spying on people. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3925.2599999999998s)]
*  Canada, the UK, the United States, Vietnam, everybody has banned using 5G technology from [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3927.46s)]
*  China for a reason, because they will use it to spy on you. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3934.2799999999997s)]
*  This is the nature of an authoritarian government. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3937.46s)]
*  powerful to have not only the surveillance capabilities that are built into owning TikTok [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3942.06s)]
*  in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, to have the ability to very, in a very nuanced [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3948.58s)]
*  fashion, trend certain videos that would steer the United States in a certain direction politically. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3955.54s)]
*  And just stupidity. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3962.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3963.54s)]
*  Towards stupidity is one, of course. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3964.54s)]
*  Right? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3966.1s)]
*  They're letting their... [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3967.1s)]
*  You need only look at what... [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3968.1s)]
*  That 60 minutes clip is incredible, right? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3969.1s)]
*  It's like they show... [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3970.14s)]
*  You need only look... [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3971.14s)]
*  They're showing science videos to the kids in China. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3972.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3974.14s)]
*  And they're showing stupid nonsense to the kids in America. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3975.14s)]
*  What do you think over millions of videos that tells our children versus their children? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3977.06s)]
*  You can be 100% certain they're doing psyops on our children as we speak. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3981.9s)]
*  They are trying to make us dumb and distracted while they get smart and sharp. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3985.54s)]
*  By the way, if you're a Zuck or Sundar... [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3989.42s)]
*  I don't know, that's not the choices of our kids. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3991.94s)]
*  The algorithm just gives you more of what you want. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3995.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3997.14s)]
*  That's like saying if you gave kids a choice between broccoli and chocolate bars, of course [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=3998.18s)]
*  you're going to pick chocolate bars. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4001.98s)]
*  If you put kids in the supermarket and say, eat, they're going to go right to the cereal [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4002.98s)]
*  aisle. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4006.22s)]
*  The job of the parent sacks is number one, know their name, and then number two, differentiate [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4007.22s)]
*  between good things and bad things. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4011.06s)]
*  Let me ask you a question. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4014.06s)]
*  I agree with Chamath that the future is not bright for TikTok here because it's gotten [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4015.06s)]
*  caught up in the geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4018.58s)]
*  And that's only going to keep getting more and more intense. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4022.54s)]
*  The US and China are headed for a big security competition and by dance is caught in the [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4025.58s)]
*  middle. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4029.58s)]
*  So I agree with Chamath about the future. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4030.58s)]
*  But this claim is made that TikTok is spyware and it's listening to you, it's surveilling [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4032.58s)]
*  you, it's keeping track of you. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4039.58s)]
*  What is the evidence for that claim? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4042.02s)]
*  I just want to understand that a little better. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4043.38s)]
*  Has anyone ever proven that TikTok is spyware? [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4045.06s)]
*  And if it is, why doesn't Apple stop it? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4048.5s)]
*  Can you just explain that to me? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4051.7799999999997s)]
*  Apple has a complicated relationship with China. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4053.94s)]
*  So the claim... [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4056.42s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4057.42s)]
*  So, Jake, your claim is... [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4058.42s)]
*  Let me just want to pin Jake down on this for a second. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4060.42s)]
*  Your claim is that 100% TikTok is spyware and Apple is letting it happen because of [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4063.14s)]
*  their relationship with the CCP. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4069.54s)]
*  I do not have the evidence of specific instances of them spying. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4071.62s)]
*  But I do know that this is what the Chinese government's aspiration is, is to be able [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4075.7s)]
*  to have backdoors to spy on all Americans. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4080.18s)]
*  That's why they are trying to get Huawei into as many places as possible. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4082.74s)]
*  But does iOS allow that to happen? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4086.18s)]
*  Well, you don't even need to know that because you can just open your eyes and look at... [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4087.2999999999997s)]
*  And I mean, that's an insult, but you can just look at what TikTok has the access to. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4092.02s)]
*  It has access to your location, has access to your camera roll, and it knows everybody [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4096.099999999999s)]
*  in your social circle because it has your address book. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4102.5s)]
*  So by having your address book, having your location, and having access to your photo [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4106.099999999999s)]
*  roll, they have you compromised by default. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4109.3s)]
*  The default settings when you install TikTok, it turns on local network, turns on microphone, [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4111.9s)]
*  turns on camera, turns on background app refresh, and turns on cell data. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4116.78s)]
*  So TikTok is no worse than anybody else in that because a lot of other apps are very [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4121.74s)]
*  aggressively trying to harvest all that data as well. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4128.179999999999s)]
*  Sachs, it's like Alexa is always listening to you, right? [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4130.62s)]
*  But you feel safer with Alexa because it's an American company or the perception of safety [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4133.7s)]
*  is there. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4139.66s)]
*  I don't think there's a huge thing to prove other than, yeah, there's a setting that allows [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4140.74s)]
*  you to turn on the microphone and it's a default and they do it. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4145.34s)]
*  But they were caught. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4149.22s)]
*  I just want to make sure you guys understand this. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4150.22s)]
*  According to the New York Times ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok said [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4151.78s)]
*  on Thursday that an internal investigation found that employees had inappropriately obtained [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4155.16s)]
*  the data of US TikTok users, including that of two reporters. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4159.18s)]
*  Over the summer, a few employees on a ByteDance team responsible for monitoring employee conduct [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4163.88s)]
*  tried to find the source of suspected leaks of internal conversation and business documents [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4168.38s)]
*  to journalists. In doing so, the employees gained access to the IP addresses and other [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4172.3s)]
*  data of two reporters and a small number of people connected with the reporters via the [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4175.9400000000005s)]
*  TikTok accounts they were trying to determine if those individuals were within the proximity [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4180.02s)]
*  of ByteDance employees, according to the company. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4183.76s)]
*  So there's an example of them using the technology to try to track down leaks. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4186.22s)]
*  Hold on a second. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4189.66s)]
*  That's exactly what any app a company can do. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4190.66s)]
*  The screenshots we got from Twitter that were shared in all those files or whatever that [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4194.780000000001s)]
*  happened a few weeks ago showed that many Twitter employees were able to log in and [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4199.860000000001s)]
*  just view the direct messages between Twitter users and that there's no necessary logging [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4204.16s)]
*  or access privileges required to have access to that information. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4209.900000000001s)]
*  There are these holes in all of these social networking and digital consumer product companies [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4213.860000000001s)]
*  that allow individuals to go in and do things with consumer data. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4219.8s)]
*  It's got a hole. It's a feature. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4222.98s)]
*  It's a feature, sure, but it doesn't reference like some systematic... [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4224.66s)]
*  Yeah, but those aren't controlled by a government agency. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4227.7s)]
*  No, that's the key thing. What J. Cal just said is a key thing. Everybody tries to get [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4230.74s)]
*  these things turned default on. Every app tries to get access to your camera roll, to [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4235.219999999999s)]
*  your contacts, to turn on the microphone. The problem isn't that those settings exist [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4239.259999999999s)]
*  because Apple created them and Apple created a privacy framework where you have to opt [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4243.379999999999s)]
*  out of it. Okay? The issue is that that data, instead of going to an American company with [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4248.0599999999995s)]
*  American data centers and American service, it's going to somebody in China, or it's the [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4252.94s)]
*  perception that that's happening that I think is a death knell. And this is also excluding [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4259.299999999999s)]
*  all of the work that every single big tech company must be doing to point the finger [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4265.82s)]
*  away from them. And this is something they can all agree on. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4271.419999999999s)]
*  If you got Andy Jassy and Zuck and Sundar and Satya Nadella in a room, what do you think [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4275.98s)]
*  they could all agree on? Hey, guys, are we better off pointing the fingers at each other? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4281.74s)]
*  Or should we just point it over there to a company based in China? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4285.46s)]
*  So, do you think that TikTok in a way is being scapegoated here or do you think it's a real [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4288.139999999999s)]
*  security threat? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4293.54s)]
*  Both. Both. Yeah, that's yes to both. And you know what? I think what we saw with the [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4294.54s)]
*  Twitter files for me personally, the one that was most concerning was the fact that the [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4299.5s)]
*  FBI was being treated, they didn't have control of it, like the Chinese government has control [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4306.14s)]
*  over by dance at a wholesale level, but they were being given, you know, pretty close to [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4312.740000000001s)]
*  it. They weren't given gone privileges, but they had more influence than they should have [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4320.26s)]
*  and they should have gotten subpoenas, right? So, even in a democracy like the United States, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4323.14s)]
*  you can see the FBI using techniques to get employees on their side to get information [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4327.26s)]
*  on specific users. Imagine if the FBI just had Godmode for Twitter or Facebook. Like, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4334.5s)]
*  what would happen in even in a democracy? We see it happen. We see abuse. The Chinese [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4339.94s)]
*  government is a communist party. They have no problem sucking the data down of every [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4345.46s)]
*  single person and using it however they want. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4349.74s)]
*  I think the problematic thing is that when you look at the capital structure of these [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4353.62s)]
*  Chinese companies post now Xi being ruler for life is the Chinese government has typically [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4357.38s)]
*  a seat on all of these boards. They also typically have a golden vote. And so when you think [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4364.22s)]
*  about the governance, the governance of these companies has tilted far away from a normal [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4370.66s)]
*  cap table where it's one shareholder one vote to you are allowed to exist on this cap table [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4376.780000000001s)]
*  at the benevolence of the government. And so I think that you have to factor that in [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4382.780000000001s)]
*  as well, Zach. So, you know, is it amplified? Probably. But is there also non trivial risk [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4388.1s)]
*  that we would never give to any other company? Absolutely. Like, you know, take the opposite [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4395.06s)]
*  example. How would we react if the government had a golden vote and a board seat on meta? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4399.700000000001s)]
*  Going into an election? I mean, one party would be crazy. And the other party would [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4410.780000000001s)]
*  stay mums the word. That's what I mean. Let's talk about but let's let's let's let's be [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4416.66s)]
*  pragmatic. The news reports that came out this week indicate that they're talking about [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4421.18s)]
*  restructuring by dance. So let me propose this to you guys. If tick tock us were set [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4425.94s)]
*  up as tick tock us ink to don't see corp. It's based in the US and by dance owns passive [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4431.1s)]
*  non voting shares in tick tock us ink all the software all the services the algorithms [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4438.14s)]
*  are all run in the US the data servers and the Chinese have an economic interest ultimately [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4443.8s)]
*  in what happens with that asset. But that asset is entirely managed run totally controlled [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4449.4800000000005s)]
*  that should be a goal in the US and I think you should do that. And if that happens, you [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4453.76s)]
*  trigger syphias. So you'd have to then make an exception. That sounds like part of the [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4458.96s)]
*  discussion that's underway right now is how do we get past this regulatory hurdle? I don't [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4463.08s)]
*  know guys, I've said this in the past. I don't know how you turn off tick tock for 100 million [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4467.08s)]
*  people that are using it for two hours a day. Guys, we're making Instagram and YouTube [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4470.88s)]
*  replicated it. We're rejecting deals, left, right and center at much, much smaller thresholds [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4475.400000000001s)]
*  because of syphias because it's the we're not and we're not even dealing with China. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4480.72s)]
*  Assume you get past syphias, Chumup. Assume that there is no that I think that's a bad [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4484.12s)]
*  assumption. Right. But like that's obviously this $8 billion of capital. Can I tell you [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4488.72s)]
*  what happened? Right. The minute that if you let the Chinese government around and do an [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4493.32s)]
*  end around on syphias to own 30% passively, then everybody who's had a deal rejected for [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4498.22s)]
*  a much smaller threshold for a much more benign issue will sue. Except that they started with [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4503.700000000001s)]
*  this asset versus buying into it. Right. That's the difference. And what they're doing is [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4509.62s)]
*  they're seeding that the difference here is they're seeding control of the asset to US [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4513.18s)]
*  investors and oversight by the US government versus the reverse, which is trying to come [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4517.58s)]
*  in and buy an economic asset. That's not what syphias adjudicates. It doesn't adjudicate [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4522.02s)]
*  where was this originated adjudicates in this cap table? Does this person exist? Should they [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4526.26s)]
*  exist? At what threshold? What do they know? And are we giving something that we shouldn't [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4531.22s)]
*  give? Yeah, let me give you another way of saying if the pragmatic answer is you can't just make [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4534.5s)]
*  up a bunch of stuff that blows up a bunch of other stuff. Let me frame it differently. What [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4540.66s)]
*  if ByteDance sold tick tock us to a US owned private equity consortium or US run private [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4544.1s)]
*  equity consortium that effectively bought tick tock us and operated in here in the US? That's [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4550.34s)]
*  exactly what should happen. But my point is those people are smart enough to not pay full price. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4554.9s)]
*  They'll say you're fucked. That asset is worth zero. I will buy it for $10 billion. Take it or [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4559.379999999999s)]
*  leave it. And you know what they'll have to do. They'll have to take it. So my point is the equity [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4566.099999999999s)]
*  value is so impaired in this thing. Will you buy that? For 10 billion? Of course I'm a buyer, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4570.099999999999s)]
*  but these guys are smart enough to drive a huge bar hard bargain. So if you're existing on the [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4574.66s)]
*  cap table and you've marked it at 320, I would be fucking selling it. Okay, well, look, something [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4579.62s)]
*  like this is going to happen. So it'll be interesting to watch. And if any group of people [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4584.98s)]
*  got together and tried to actually buy it for what the fair market value is worth via a spreadsheet, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4589.0599999999995s)]
*  is a horrible investor in this moment. You should hold a gun to their head and you should extract [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4595.62s)]
*  a massive pound of flesh that gives you a huge margin of safety and makes you money. We know [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4601.62s)]
*  people who are shareholders, if they could have sold it at 320 or 120, they would have sold [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4605.7s)]
*  already. Well, no, there are people that'll buy this thing in the hundreds. That's in size. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4610.0199999999995s)]
*  Then sell everything you can and then put it into another company. Now the problem is you have to [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4614.66s)]
*  show a markdown because you've already marked it at 320. So you gotta take a 65% discount. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4618.82s)]
*  You know what? Yeah, if you're underwater, you're underwater. But for anybody who got into the sub [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4622.66s)]
*  1 billion round, you can't eat IRR and you can't eat paper markups. You can only eat the distribution. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4628.0199999999995s)]
*  So get the DPI and move on is what I said. Get the DPI and move on. It's another bet you could place. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4634.26s)]
*  Why try to be greedy and get the last 3X out of this investment? [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4638.5s)]
*  I want to move away from software meets leisure to software meets human health and productivity. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4642.02s)]
*  A couple of weeks ago, we were going to talk about this last week, it was announced that BioNTech [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4648.820000000001s)]
*  was buying InstaDeep. InstaDeep is a broad horizontal AI or machine learning tools company, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4652.74s)]
*  services business. They partner with big businesses to help them build out ML driven [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4658.42s)]
*  infrastructure to improve their products and their operations and their businesses. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4663.54s)]
*  One of their customers was BioNTech, the company that designed and owned VIP [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4669.14s)]
*  for the original Pfizer COVID vaccine. One of the originators of mRNA based technology. BioNTech [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4676.42s)]
*  doesn't just focus on mRNA technology. They also focus on cell and gene therapies, the novel new [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4684.66s)]
*  modalities that are emerging in therapeutics. It was a really interesting acquisition. It was a [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4691.94s)]
*  250 person team that they bought the company for about $600 million specifically to improve how [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4698.98s)]
*  AI can be used to accelerate drug discovery. I'll just make a comment on this and then, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4706.0199999999995s)]
*  Sax, I'd love to hear your point of view on these types of businesses broadly. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4711.22s)]
*  The capabilities of machine learning when applied to a particular vertical are quite profound. I've [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4715.38s)]
*  certainly been involved in this space in agriculture and increasingly doing more of this work in [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4721.78s)]
*  pharmaceuticals and biotech. When you can have large, unique data sets that you can then model [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4726.34s)]
*  using these tools and these capabilities and be predictive about what the next product iteration [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4734.9800000000005s)]
*  should be, it can really change the value and the trajectory of your business. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4740.74s)]
*  One of the big trends in pharma right now is to move from in vitro testing, meaning you're [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4745.46s)]
*  running biochemical experiments in labs, in assays, iterating testing, experimenting to see what [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4750.42s)]
*  molecules work or what protein does what and if it binds to the target and doing more of this in [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4755.86s)]
*  silica as it's being called, which is in software. Rather than just doing testing in software, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4761.3s)]
*  you can actually use tools like AlphaFold that can be predictive of large molecules [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4766.1s)]
*  and how they can drive outcomes to make decisions about what to put in your pipeline. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4770.900000000001s)]
*  If you take 99% of the junk out of the top of your pipeline and you only focus on the 1% that the [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4775.700000000001s)]
*  software predicts will be more successful, you much more quickly get drug discovery through the [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4780.820000000001s)]
*  pipeline and you have a much higher hit rate. The ROI is extraordinary, particularly when you're [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4785.700000000001s)]
*  talking about multi-billion dollar revenue streams coming out the other end of that pipeline. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4790.42s)]
*  I think the way this reads, these guys raised $100 million in a round last year, sold the company [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4794.9800000000005s)]
*  for $600 million. It seems very similar to DeepMind being bought by Alphabet a few years ago, [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4799.540000000001s)]
*  where the application of the team is pretty broad across a number of opportunities, but BioNTech [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4804.34s)]
*  bought them to focus on the pharma space. I guess in the earlier stage, and I see a lot of teams [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4810.34s)]
*  now that are like, hey, we're AI for this or ML for that. A lot of pharma and biotech deals [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4816.9800000000005s)]
*  have to have the catchphrase ML or AI in their writing now because of the economic improvement [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4823.46s)]
*  of those businesses. Are you looking at enterprise software businesses that aren't necessarily about [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4829.54s)]
*  the typical subscription model where you sell a seat license and people pay for that, but have [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4834.66s)]
*  this broad tool set and toolkit where these folks are earning revenue share or participating in a [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4840.9s)]
*  services revenue stream for enhancing the value of their partner in the AI or ML space? What's [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4845.62s)]
*  the better business model? Because I think this is where so many new teams are starting out, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4852.5s)]
*  is what's the business model and what should we be focused on with our ML toolkit? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4856.98s)]
*  I mean, the short answer is no. We haven't done any deals like that. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4862.18s)]
*  Well, we were not pharma investors, so I don't know how I'd be able to evaluate, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4866.82s)]
*  even if it is a software product, I don't know how to evaluate its effect on pharma outcomes. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4870.42s)]
*  So, I mean, we haven't done any deals like that. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4876.98s)]
*  Other verticals. I mean, like, do you look at ML and AI companies that are more services or [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4878.82s)]
*  partner oriented versus just selling seat licenses to a software tool? I mean, is that a big trend [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4882.74s)]
*  you're seeing? I don't think we have enough data to tell you what the trend is. We did a deal called [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4887.139999999999s)]
*  Pearl, which is creating an AI for dentistry. So what it'll do is it scans in all of the x-rays and [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4892.34s)]
*  dental records from dental practices and it gives a kind of a second opinion. It can spot things like [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4900.98s)]
*  cavities and things like that, or just changes in the condition. Where it's really powerful is [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4907.94s)]
*  over time, right? If it's got your last six sets of x-rays over a whatever six year period, it can [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4911.46s)]
*  detect changes that are probably, you know, hard for a human to see. So they think they can get to, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4918.66s)]
*  like, better than human sort of diagnosis by using computer vision. And then we invested in, [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4924.419999999999s)]
*  sort of after that, we realized, okay, this is kind of like a powerful application. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4932.9s)]
*  So we invested in a company called RoboFlow, which creates tools for computer vision. So [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4937.219999999999s)]
*  Pearl created its own tools for taking a large number of, you know, x-rays and classifying them [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4942.66s)]
*  and then creating their own AI tools. RoboFlow gives you that same tool set, but you can run it [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4950.5s)]
*  on any computer vision project. And they seem to be building a pretty big universe of software [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4956.0199999999995s)]
*  developers who are using their tools. And in this case, this was a team that was bought, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4961.78s)]
*  they bought a 250 person team for $600 million that just had this capability set really and a [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4965.78s)]
*  toolkit. Does that change your outlook for investing in ML AI companies? When you see a [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4970.58s)]
*  $600 million exit for effectively a capability, they didn't have, you know, a core product that [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4975.62s)]
*  was in market. They were doing kind of these co-development deals. But I mean, how much does [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4981.139999999999s)]
*  this sort of an AI set? Well, I mean, AI is already the hot thing. Everyone's kind of looking at this [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4985.46s)]
*  now. I don't know, like you never want to base an investment decision on the fact that some [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4990.5s)]
*  acquirer might come in and buy you for a large amount of money when you have no revenue or [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=4996.74s)]
*  business model. I just think like that's not really a sustainable approach. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5003.14s)]
*  Although it does seem that AI engineers go for 2 million each, I think is kind of your point, [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5006.34s)]
*  Dave. On an M&A basis? Yeah, I mean, DeepMind got bought for what, 600 by Google? And I think they [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5012.02s)]
*  had 200 people. I think it was like 400. Yeah, it was like 400. Yeah. So yeah, it does seem like, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5017.54s)]
*  and I think DeepMind did not have a business concept in mind when they were funded. They [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5023.46s)]
*  just wanted to do research, right? That was kind of the unique thing about that company. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5028.58s)]
*  Platform capability, similar to InstaDeep. I mean, there's a lot of these, that's what I'm [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5031.78s)]
*  pointing out is like some of these platform capabilities end up just getting bought for, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5035.22s)]
*  you know, huge sums. Yeah. It's a dangerous strategy, a sex poison. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5040.0199999999995s)]
*  You can't invest in a company hoping for an unreasonable acquisition, meaning, unreasonable [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5046.02s)]
*  meaning that... Unreasonable acquire. Yeah. Yeah. Like, unreasonable meaning that your own metrics [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5050.660000000001s)]
*  don't reflect that valuation as a business. You might be worth it as a strategic acquisition of [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5056.18s)]
*  somebody else. But you actually raise an interesting question, which is, is a seat model [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5061.54s)]
*  the right way for one of these companies to price their product? And you may be right that the seat [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5068.1s)]
*  license model doesn't really work because like how many seats do you really need to buy for these [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5072.5s)]
*  companies? Look, I mean, one of my... One product engineer. Yeah. No, no, it's true. I mean, we've [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5076.98s)]
*  seen this, we've even seen, we've had these debates inside the companies I mentioned where like, you [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5082.5s)]
*  know, charging a $10 or even a $100 a month seat doesn't really reflect the value of the insights [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5088.66s)]
*  that are being created. And so yeah, there are like, you know, there are, I don't think this has been [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5095.38s)]
*  figured out yet. But this is the big question in ML and AI. When I was at Monsanto, you know, we had [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5099.86s)]
*  all this IP licensing deals we do or new products would come to market. And it was never cost plus [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5104.42s)]
*  or simple pricing. It was always about value capture. If in an enterprise setting, you know, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5110.0199999999995s)]
*  because we sold to farmers, it's like, how much value are you delivering for the farmers? If it's [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5113.86s)]
*  $100 a profit an acre, you try and charge an incremental $30 an acre for that product. And [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5117.299999999999s)]
*  it was always a one-third value capture model. And the same is true in biotech and pharma. The [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5122.42s)]
*  producer of the product or the co developer of the product is often trying to value capture. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5127.3s)]
*  And it's not a site seat license, and it's not a service fee, it's more ultimately, we want to get [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5132.1s)]
*  a royalty on the outcome on the improvement that we can deliver to you. And so there's all these [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5136.1s)]
*  novel business models that are emerging, at least that I'm seeing in pharma and biotech, [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5140.1s)]
*  to participate more meaningfully ultimately in the drug development outcome, versus just getting [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5143.7s)]
*  charged a fee for doing a service or a fee for a license to a software packet. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5148.1s)]
*  The value of these companies has gone down. I was a early investor, series A investor in [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5152.1s)]
*  company called Flatiron Health, we sold it for $1.9 billion to Roche. That's the biggest exit in [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5156.9s)]
*  this space for this machine learning enabled stuff. It happened in 2018. And so what's really [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5162.98s)]
*  happened is the value of acquisition and M&A has gone down, even as the technology capability has [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5167.54s)]
*  gone way, way up. And why is that it's because this stuff has yet to be proven to actually [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5172.0199999999995s)]
*  meaningfully improve the hit rate for these drug companies. So whether it's biotech or Roche or [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5178.0199999999995s)]
*  anybody else, the biggest problem we still have is getting the design space, [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5184.26s)]
*  guessing that better. And these machines are better at doing raw calculations, but they're [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5190.34s)]
*  not necessarily better at veering towards this design space over this design space. And so as [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5195.22s)]
*  a result, you're not improving the either the slugging percentage, or the batting average [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5200.34s)]
*  of these pharma companies. And that's why they're paying less and less. So everybody will have this [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5207.7s)]
*  capability as an adjunct. The thing that you have to do is sort of what what you guys have said, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5211.7s)]
*  which is if there's a company that can actually do better guessing at the top of the funnel, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5219.3s)]
*  the thing that you should probably do is just give it away in return for a back end rev share [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5224.74s)]
*  and royalty. And that business also exists. So you know, the best performing company in pharma [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5229.3s)]
*  is a company called Royalty Pharma. It's a $22.5 billion company that has 90% EBITDA margins. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5234.66s)]
*  It exists in Ireland. It's run in New York by this wonderful entrepreneur, Pablo Lagareta, [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5240.26s)]
*  but that's what he does. He buys small pieces of royalties. And his whole thing is like the [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5245.38s)]
*  Paul Graham thing at YC. I'll give you just that little amount of support and all you need is a [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5250.1s)]
*  little lift in valuation to justify giving me the 6%. And the tooling company, the AI company that [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5255.9400000000005s)]
*  does that could win who would go to Roche and buy on tech or Lily or somebody else and just say, look, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5262.5s)]
*  use my tools. And whatever drug you generate off of me, I just want a 3% royalty. And all you need [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5268.82s)]
*  to do is just show a 3% lift across a portfolio of assets. That would be a killer business model. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5275.94s)]
*  Because if you look at what Pablo's done, over a large number of successes, that's a ginormous [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5281.54s)]
*  company. Jay Kal, I mean, are you investing in the seed stage ML AI companies? And are there novel [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5286.82s)]
*  business models that you're seeing? We're not seeing too many yet, to be honest, we are seeing [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5293.86s)]
*  people play with chat GPT and kind of do, you know, experiments. But, you know, the more I've [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5298.5s)]
*  used chat GPT, we've connected it to our slack. So you can actually ask a question in our slack [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5308.1s)]
*  in a channel called AI testing, and it will give the answer and everybody can see people like [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5316.18s)]
*  playing with it. You know, it's kind of like a parlor trick. Now I'm in like, that phase where [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5320.1s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, this is impressive. But it didn't actually solve my problem. And it's slightly [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5327.54s)]
*  faster than doing a Google search. So I am thinking there's going to be a really good business created [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5334.5s)]
*  in taking the open source projects and forking them and verticalizing them like, you know, sexes. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5343.3s)]
*  One that's doing dental work, you know, like this makes sense to me. Somebody should do it in [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5350.9s)]
*  accounting, somebody should learn all of gap accounting, which is pretty simple, because it's [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5355.14s)]
*  published, FASB, all of this nonsensical accounting rules, and give you 100% guarantee of no malfeasance. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5358.900000000001s)]
*  So for example, you guys saw this Brazilian company, you want AI accounting, that's your [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5366.740000000001s)]
*  look at this company, low just low just say, look at this company, Americanas in Brazil, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5372.1s)]
*  which just torched $20 billion of enterprise value. Why? Because these guys were using Excel [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5378.5s)]
*  to do a bunch of complicated capitalization and cost accounting, made two or three years of [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5385.3s)]
*  mistakes, it added up to two or $3 billion. And they're basically going to file bankruptcy in [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5390.34s)]
*  the next few days. That's completely avoidable human error that should never happen. And AI would [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5395.700000000001s)]
*  be perfect for that. Like this is not super controversial to just follow gap accounting. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5403.860000000001s)]
*  Right? I mean, I don't know if you need AI for that. I think you just need software, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5409.14s)]
*  like a database would be good. But no, the problem is the database exists today, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5413.22s)]
*  like everybody sits on top of Oracle GL or Workday, it doesn't prevent these errors. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5417.9400000000005s)]
*  So my point is, you got to get humans out of the system, and the AI should be the accountant, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5422.26s)]
*  the AI knows the rules, generates the PNL and says this is it. And by the way, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5426.18s)]
*  that's way better risk management for the CEO and the CFO. Because as you guys know, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5431.38s)]
*  if you're the CEO of a public company, you have to sign your signature that these things are [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5434.9800000000005s)]
*  legitimate. And how do you know? I would way better know that a computer did it like an open [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5439.7s)]
*  AI algorithm tells me, this PNL is perfect, then some dude I don't know at Ernst & Young. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5444.66s)]
*  Okay. I have a question for Sachs. Sachsie Poo, can you please explain to me why Alec Baldwin [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5451.0599999999995s)]
*  is going to get charged with manslaughter for this rust thing? That seems really crazy. Can you just [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5457.62s)]
*  explain what happens on a set with guns? And how the hell did this happen? Like what the hell is [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5462.66s)]
*  going on? Well, I've produced two movies, but neither one of them involved, you know, guns or [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5466.74s)]
*  shootouts or anything like that. So I haven't had like firsthand experience with this. I have [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5472.179999999999s)]
*  You're a gun owner. So you're an intersection of movie producer and gun owner. So it's a good [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5475.94s)]
*  Yeah, I understand the rules of gun safety and that kind of stuff. Look, Alec Baldwin did not [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5479.62s)]
*  follow the rules of gun safety. The first thing I would do if I was ever handed a gun would be to [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5486.26s)]
*  clear it. I'd like check to see if it was loaded and clear it. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5491.459999999999s)]
*  And you never pointed at somebody, you always treat a gun as if it's loaded, even if you think [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5495.459999999999s)]
*  it's not. But he was in a very specific situation, which is he's on a movie set. And the person who's [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5500.179999999999s)]
*  handing him the gun is the armorer. And someone whose job it is. And said cold gun. Yeah, exactly. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5505.78s)]
*  It's somebody whose job it is to make sure that the gun is handled properly and unloaded and all [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5512.259999999999s)]
*  that kind of stuff. And they're using it on a set. So I agree with you. I don't quite understand [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5517.54s)]
*  why Alec Baldwin is liable in that situation for the gun going off the person who screwed up here. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5523.54s)]
*  The person who screwed up is the armor. The armor. I have a question person whose job it was to never [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5531.22s)]
*  allow live ammunition on the set. But the guns properly. I thought the whole point of guns in [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5536.18s)]
*  movies was that they were fine blanks. Yeah, they were firing blanks, but they had blanks [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5542.5s)]
*  and regular ones in their kit for whatever reason, because they were shooting real ones as well. But [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5548.74s)]
*  this is involuntary manslaughter. And I think Baldwin is also the producer of the film. So I [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5554.82s)]
*  don't know if this has to do with his hiring of the armorer. You know what I'm saying? No, that I can [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5560.5s)]
*  speak to. Listen, you frequently give stars in an independent movie a producer title. He's not [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5566.02s)]
*  responsible for the physical production of the movie. I bet anything he's not. There's a guy [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5573.3s)]
*  called the line producer is responsible for the physical production. And my guess is he wasn't [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5577.780000000001s)]
*  responsible for the business side of the production. They've got other producers for that. So it [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5581.780000000001s)]
*  doesn't make sense to me if they're going to charge him for having some sort of overall liability as [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5586.660000000001s)]
*  a producer to then not charge the other producers. That just doesn't make any sense. So I think this [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5591.78s)]
*  producer credit thing is probably a red herring. Like I said, I think the armorer is the person who [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5596.82s)]
*  is singularly responsible for this situation. They're the ones who screwed up. They're the ones [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5601.86s)]
*  who had a responsibility to make sure that the gun handed to an actor. I mean, I like Baldwin's [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5606.42s)]
*  an actor. Yeah. Look, conservatives in social media are dragging the guy because they think he's [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5611.3s)]
*  a douchebag and he doesn't know how to handle guns. But that's not his job. He doesn't. He's [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5616.0199999999995s)]
*  not a question. Yeah. Movies. Why would you ever have live ammunition on a movie set? [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5620.34s)]
*  You shouldn't. They shouldn't. You shouldn't. It's a mistake. So it's not as if like the scene is [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5626.02s)]
*  different if you have a real bullet versus a blank. No, it's as far as I know, it's only blanks. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5631.22s)]
*  If I remember right, there was a story about how the gun armory people were taking members of the [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5637.54s)]
*  cast and crew and they were shooting guns for fun in the desert. And they were doing like they were [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5643.7s)]
*  doing like targets and messing around and teaching people gun stuff and just playing around, [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5649.7s)]
*  but using live ammunition and that that led into an accident that there wasn't good kind of [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5653.7s)]
*  transition. That's really bad. That sounds like the kind of negligence that caused this. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5658.82s)]
*  But unless there are facts we don't know about, I don't know why. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5662.58s)]
*  The armor is also being charged, by the way, with involuntary. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5666.42s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Alec Baldwin is being charged along with the armor. That sounds totally legit to me. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5669.139999999999s)]
*  So guys, listen, I need to run another call. I was going to talk about this really fantastic paper [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5673.78s)]
*  on the one of the driving forces of aging as demonstrated by a team from Harvard [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5681.7s)]
*  in collaboration with many others on epigenetics and the loss of data integrity and epigenetics, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5688.5s)]
*  really being the core driver of aging in mammalian cells. It's an incredible paper. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5696.099999999999s)]
*  It speaks a lot to what we talked about last year, Yamanaka factors and partial [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5700.42s)]
*  epigenetic reprogramming of cells, how they can reverse aging. These guys have demonstrated it [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5704.1s)]
*  in a really powerful way. I'd love to spend some time on it. Maybe we pump that science corner to [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5708.42s)]
*  next week. Wrap up for today. I think we've talked about all sorts of fun stuff. It's been [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5712.5s)]
*  a real pleasure and an honor to be in the seat of the world's greatest moderator. We missed him [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5717.38s)]
*  today. We honor him. We look forward to having his return next week. It's been a pleasure chatting [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5722.18s)]
*  with you gentlemen. And on behalf of the all in pod and my co-hosts, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5728.34s)]
*  Jamal Paliha Patia, David Sachs, Jason Calacanis, thank you for listening. Bye. Bye. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7E22zdUDpk&t=5732.34s)]
