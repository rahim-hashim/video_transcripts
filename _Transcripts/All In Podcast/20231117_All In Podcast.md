# In conversation with Dean Phillips
**All In Podcast:** [November 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA)
*  Congressman, how should we refer to you today? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, I prefer Dean, but you know, let's go with that. Mr. Phillips, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4.0s)]
*  and just I'm asking people to be keen on Dean. So I might as well run with it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Oh, there you go. Well, you know, I'm a big supporter of the Dean machine already. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=12.16s)]
*  Oh, you know about the Dean machine with this gelato. I'm all up on the Dean machine. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=16.16s)]
*  By the way, I bought an old international harvester Metro van for 20s when we did [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  activations like South by Southwest and I used to own one of those by the way. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=24.72s)]
*  No, you did? Yeah, I bought it for my ranch. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=28.0s)]
*  Come on. I love that baby. So I bought one for Tlenty and I saw how people just [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=30.8s)]
*  immediately were attracted to it and fell in love with it. And I thought, hey, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=35.68s)]
*  when I ran for Congress, I'm going to do the same thing. So I created the government repair truck. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=38.88s)]
*  Are you driving around in this international harvester? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=45.68s)]
*  You're kidding. Yeah, I'll show you. I'll send you a picture of it. It's cool. It's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=46.24s)]
*  got a 1980 Chevy chassis under it, but it's still the basic nuts and bolts. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  Sachs, we're referring to a type of automobile. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=55.2s)]
*  You can ask one of your three drivers about it, David. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  Don't worry, David. Your driver can take you in it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=59.92s)]
*  Ask your Miami driver. He probably owns some muscle cars. I don't think your LA [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  driver owns muscle cars. Here we go. Let's start this. Three, two. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=65.2s)]
*  Hey everybody. Hey everybody. Welcome to the All In Podcast with us again today, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=85.36s)]
*  the dictator himself, Chamath Palihapitiya, the Rain Man, David Sachs, and the Sultan of Science, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  David Friedberg. We are going to continue our conversation series with presidential candidates [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=96.8s)]
*  today. Our fourth presidential candidate is on the program. Dean Phillips represents Minnesota's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=103.76s)]
*  third district, and he's about 25 years younger than Trump and Biden at 54 years old. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=109.6s)]
*  Dean, before getting into politics, I understand you were the CEO of your family's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  spirits business and you ran Talenty Gelato. Oh, that pistachio flavor. Amazing. So, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=121.92s)]
*  welcome to the All In Podcast, Meet the Other Besties, and maybe you could just start out by [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=128.4s)]
*  telling us why you are running for president. Yeah, well, I'll tell you, after being in the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=133.12s)]
*  vodka business and the ice cream business and actually the coffee business, I think I understand [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=138.24s)]
*  at least what Americans want. So, that's a good start. Well, I'll tell you a little about my [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=142.24s)]
*  background and why I'm here. I lost my dad in the Vietnam War when I was just six months old. He [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=146.4s)]
*  grew up with no money in St. Paul, Minnesota. He earned an ROTC scholarship on behalf of the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  federal government, of course, to pursue his education. I went to Vietnam in 1968, just before [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=156.72s)]
*  I was born. I got to see the U.S. land on the moon, and I think regularly about how he looked [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=162.32s)]
*  up two days before his helicopter crashed and he died. Looked up and saw Americans on the moon [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=167.84s)]
*  and looked down and saw America at its worst. And literally that experience, in no small way, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=173.92s)]
*  is what brings me to this day. And I was six months old. My mom was 24 and widowed and we moved in [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=179.12s)]
*  with my great grandparents for the first three years of my life. And I got lucky when I was three. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=186.0s)]
*  My mom married a wonderful, extraordinary man who adopted me, Eddie Phillips, brought me into a [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=190.56s)]
*  family of great blessings. My grandmother became Dear Abby and my aunt Anne Landers. So, I grew up [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=195.36s)]
*  in a family of a lot of advice. And I've lived on both sides of the advantage and I recognize it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=200.16s)]
*  I remember the day I turned 26 and I counted the days that my father had lived, my birth father. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=206.32s)]
*  And I remember the day after I had lived as many days as him. My life changed forever. And I [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=213.44s)]
*  became inspired and joined our family business after college. I ended up running our beverage [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=220.39999999999998s)]
*  business. We created Belvedere vodka, which we sold to LVMH and then got into the ice cream business. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=225.67999999999998s)]
*  You guys created Belvedere? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=231.76s)]
*  Yeah. My father and I and our partner, Steve Gill, went on a trip to Poland in 1993, hoping to sell [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=233.2s)]
*  them Philip's schnapps, which we made in Minnesota. We thought Eastern Europe was ready for peppermint [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  and peach schnapps. And we were touring distilleries and we see both in duty-free in the [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=245.2s)]
*  airport and in the distilleries, the most beautiful packaging we had ever seen in the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=251.6s)]
*  spirits business. Now, mind you, this is when Absolute and Stoli were like the pinnacle of [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=256.32s)]
*  luxury. $15 average now. And my father immediately sat at a restaurant that night. Literally, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=260.4s)]
*  this is a literal napkin story. He, on a napkin, created a little matrix and said, if Stoli and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=267.2s)]
*  Absolute are $15 and they're the most premium in a fast-growing category, why shouldn't there be a [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=273.6s)]
*  $25 vodka and why should this not be it? So we negotiated with the Polish government. Our partner, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=279.04s)]
*  Tad Dorta from Poland, helped us. And we first obtained the distribution rights. And then when [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=284.72s)]
*  Poland privatized their spirits industry, we acquired the distillery and the IP. And the rest [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=289.6s)]
*  was history. And, you know, cork finish, beautiful bottle. We sold it. We talked about the lowest [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=296.0s)]
*  common denominator, the pens we used to write the orders, the way we carried it, made all the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=301.2s)]
*  difference in the world. And then we used that same template in ice cream. Because what we found is [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=305.28s)]
*  in every consumer product category in which there are two main competitors, Coke and Pepsi, Stoli, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=310.0s)]
*  Absolute, Ben & Jerry's and Haagen-Dazs, they tend to fight to the bottom. Lower pricing, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=317.03999999999996s)]
*  frankly demeaning consumers. And there's always an opportunity to introduce something a little bit [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=323.76s)]
*  more premium, a little bit more special, that's still an affordable luxury. And Belvedere, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  by the way, was built by Jay Z. I can tell you that story if you want to hear it. It's an [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=334.32s)]
*  extraordinary one. Yeah, tell that story. So far you're our kind of candidate. We're like, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=337.76s)]
*  yeah, you just got four votes apparently. We're all looking at you like, who is this guy? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=343.76s)]
*  So when people ask me about my platform, I'll say I'll be a storyteller about vodka. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=348.56s)]
*  I'm ready to start popping bottles over here. By the way, that's exactly what Jay Z did. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=352.08s)]
*  Sax and I popped many a Belvedere bottle when we had our run in LA. True or not true, Sax? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=356.71999999999997s)]
*  It was a tough choice between Belvedere and Grey Goose. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=362.47999999999996s)]
*  I'll tell you that story too, by the way. Anyway, so we introduced Belvedere and, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=365.84s)]
*  by the way, what we learned in hindsight is that our aperture was way too small. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=371.28s)]
*  We were way too, we sold it by the bottle, not by the case. We only went to restaurants and bars at [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=375.44s)]
*  first, not to the big stores. We wanted it to be special. And we completely underestimated the size [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=380.15999999999997s)]
*  of what this category could be. Sidney Frank, who introduced Grey Goose, took a much bigger approach. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=385.04s)]
*  Anyway, so I'm sitting at home getting ready for work one day. I have MTV on and it's probably a [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=390.08000000000004s)]
*  year after we introduced Belvedere. It's doing well, but not big. So sorry, this is what, mid 90s? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=395.36s)]
*  Yeah, I can't remember the year Chamath. It's probably, you know, 95, yeah, 90s, thereabouts. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=400.88s)]
*  I'm watching MTV. I see a Jay Z video and it is all Belvedere. It's in the fridge. He's holding it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=406.72s)]
*  People dancing, he's pouring it on him. And I froze, called my dad immediately, who, of course, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=413.2s)]
*  didn't have MTV on. And I said, you got to turn it on. He couldn't find the channel. I'm like, hey, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=419.52s)]
*  dad, you know, MTV repeats the same videos, you know, five, 10 times a day. So we got to the office [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=424.56s)]
*  and sure enough, we had the TV on. It came back on. The whole company gathered at that time. We were [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=429.6s)]
*  probably 10 people and we gathered around the TV and watched this video. And I'm telling you guys, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=433.76s)]
*  within two weeks, the brand completely popped. And my dad, Jay Z ended up calling my father. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=438.64s)]
*  They had a dinner in New York City, a memorable one for both. Actually, he ended up introducing [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=445.36s)]
*  a vodka some years later called Armadale. And it failed miserably. But it was one of the first times [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=452.0s)]
*  that I think in this new culture of influencers and celebrity endorsers, that that magic happened. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=458.4s)]
*  He almost literally made Belvedere. So that's the story. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=463.84s)]
*  Did you guys sign him to a deal and pay him money? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=467.2s)]
*  No, no, in fact, we talked about that. And the core, so this is the brand foundation of the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=469.52s)]
*  brand house was authenticity. We didn't do a damn thing that had anything to do with anything that [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  wasn't true. The makers of it, the product itself, we didn't, we didn't pay people to talk about it, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=480.55999999999995s)]
*  unlike Sidney Frank with Grey Goose. So we chose not to. It was all natural. And then here's the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=486.32s)]
*  other cool thing. And this is how my campaign is going to work. We sent 200 bottles in very special, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=491.76s)]
*  beautiful boxes to 200 influencers. We believe that if we could simply seed the brand with 200 [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=497.12s)]
*  people all around the US, that they could be the content makers and the advocates, the ambassadors. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=503.76s)]
*  In fact, one of them went to this guy right behind me, Bill Clinton. And Robert De Niro, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  another example, Robert Redford, you know, leaders of industry and actors and, and, and the like. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=514.0s)]
*  Robert De Niro gets one of these things. And there's a note inside with a picture of the [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=520.08s)]
*  distiller Bogdanszlenski. It said watch page three, the Tiffany section, I'm sorry, the Tiffany [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=523.84s)]
*  location of the Wall Street Journal on call it was like Monday, February 6. To only 200 people knew [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=529.6s)]
*  what was coming. The ad in the paper didn't show a bottle of anything. It just said Belvedere. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=536.64s)]
*  Bogdanszlenski wants to know how you like it. So we literally did an ad that cost gosh knows back [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=541.6s)]
*  then probably $100,000, tiny little top corner ad that spoke to 200 people in the United States [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=546.24s)]
*  of America that had no idea. Nobody else knew what it was. Robert De Niro goes to the Beverly [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=552.08s)]
*  Hills Hotel or the Peninsula, I can't remember, orders a Belvedere martini soon thereafter. The [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=557.04s)]
*  barman says, Mr. De Niro, we have Absolute, we have Stoli, I don't have that brand. And he says, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=561.52s)]
*  I don't think you heard me, I want a Belvedere martini. So the barman sends like the bar back [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=566.16s)]
*  to whatever the wine and spirit shop is on Rodeo driver in Beverly Hills. And the guy, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=570.88s)]
*  he comes back with a bottle. And the entire bar watched this little episode. And I'm telling you, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=576.16s)]
*  once again, within a week, that store was selling through Belvedere like it was water. So these [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=581.84s)]
*  little moments where you identify the right people. And now mind you, this is in the analog era, there [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=586.64s)]
*  was no internet, there was no social media, this was people simply talking to people. So we sold [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=591.36s)]
*  Belvedere to LVMH. And then we looked at the ice cream category. Saab Ben & Jerry's doing the same [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=596.72s)]
*  thing. If you can tell us about that. What is it like to negotiate against LVMH and Bernard Arnaud? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=601.28s)]
*  And what why do you sell it when it's working? I guess maybe it's a question. You know, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=606.72s)]
*  I'll tell you, well, this is not a story I've shared with many. They were very disingenuous. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=611.12s)]
*  And it deeply troubles me to this day, the way that my father was treated, the promises that [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=619.28s)]
*  were made simply to get a deal done and then not kept, I think is a reflection on principle. And [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=625.52s)]
*  I'll leave it at that. A lesson learned. In fact, rather than going through a competitive process, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=630.64s)]
*  which I think any enterprise would do to maximize value of a brand, our family ethos was a little [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=637.12s)]
*  different. And I think we bit. And in hindsight, it was a mistake. But I'll leave it at that. You [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=643.04s)]
*  learn less. You know what, you learn lessons every experience to this very day. I'm learning them [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=650.48s)]
*  every day on the campaign trail to that was one I would never make again. All right. Well, you got [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=654.48s)]
*  the two Davids votes with the vodka. You got mine with the gelato. And if you launch a luxury [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=660.48s)]
*  fabric brand or sweaters, I think you're going to get your mom's first. I got some other work to do [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=664.8000000000001s)]
*  for eight years. So we'll do that afterwards. I'll just wrap this long story up. So we introduced [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=668.32s)]
*  Tlenty. Obviously does well. We sold it to Unilever. Then I opened a couple of coffee shops [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=672.72s)]
*  with my family in Minneapolis thinking this would be kind of a fun folly. And then we're watching the [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=678.16s)]
*  2016 election at home. I thought I would wake up the next morning. We have Hillary Clinton as [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=682.4s)]
*  president. Not that that was thrilling to the world, but it would have been safe. And lo and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=687.6s)]
*  behold, you know what happened. And I remember telling my family that night, like, look, give [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  the guy a chance. He's not going to act like that in the White House. The presidency changes you. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=695.76s)]
*  It humbles you. It moderates you. And my family thought I was a joke. And I woke up the next [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=699.84s)]
*  morning. My 16 year old was in her room crying. My 18 year old was a freshman at college. We [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=706.48s)]
*  FaceTimed her and she's crying. And I sat at the breakfast table, guys, and I promised my daughters [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=712.0s)]
*  I would do something. I raised them to be participants, not observers. And I looked around [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=716.8s)]
*  at my district. I thought maybe I'll run for Congress. I looked around and the district had [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=723.2s)]
*  not been won by a Democrat since the 1958 election. This is now we're looking at the 2018 election, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=729.04s)]
*  60 years. And the man who had won, won his fourth term by 14 points. And people told me I was crazy. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=734.72s)]
*  You're out of your mind. You're giving up a good life to run for misery and you'll never make it [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=742.0s)]
*  and you'll embarrass yourself, which is why I did it. And not only did we win, we won by 12 points. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=746.56s)]
*  We had fun. We used invitation, not confrontation. And I drove that little van all around the [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=751.36s)]
*  district to the most unhospitable parts. I opened the service window. I served coffee [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=756.56s)]
*  and I sat, I put two chairs out and people would just come up and talk. And I found magic in just [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=761.36s)]
*  letting people share what's on their mind. They're so unheard. Anyhow, I get to, well, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=767.68s)]
*  I can tell you now, I want to tell you why I'm doing it, but that's the story of where I came [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=772.4s)]
*  from and why I'm doing this. And look, at the end of the day, I'm the one of those that got lucky. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=775.5999999999999s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of kids who lost their dads in Vietnam, who did not have the magical [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=779.52s)]
*  moment that I had to be adopted by an amazing father. And that was the difference for me. It's [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=783.92s)]
*  my job to make sure others get that same chance. Simple as that. Before we jumped into the future, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=787.92s)]
*  about why you're running and what you see for the country. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=794.0s)]
*  Talk about the years that you spent in Congress. What did you observe there? What is it like day [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  to day and what do you think is working and what isn't working? I wish we had three hours. I get [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=803.92s)]
*  there, Chamath, I get there the first week of 2019. And like all of you that come from organizational [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=810.0s)]
*  and enterprise experience, I assume that Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy would have a strategy [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=816.3199999999999s)]
*  to introduce the new members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, get to know each other, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=822.64s)]
*  do a ropes course, and build some trust or something. And my goodness, it was just the [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=827.04s)]
*  opposite, guys. We were put on separate buses going to different events. And I realized right [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=831.68s)]
*  away that they had a systemic segregation strategy on day one. You mean the two parties? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=836.8s)]
*  The two parties. I'll tell you what I've learned, and we can talk more about this. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=843.36s)]
*  The only people that want to protect the status quo of the duopoly and the political industrial [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=847.28s)]
*  complex that just surrounds it all are the two parties. And it is destructive, and I will get [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=851.68s)]
*  into that. But I recognize right away all of my colleagues that the leadership in both Democratic [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=856.2399999999999s)]
*  and Republican side, they wanted to keep us separate. They did not want to give us education [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=862.3199999999999s)]
*  and information. And they wanted to keep us so busy that we could not become threats to their [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=866.8s)]
*  power structure. You can imagine members of Congress tend to be pretty ambitious people. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=872.9599999999999s)]
*  And ultimately, they were smart to do that because they made members of Congress, they do this day, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=878.08s)]
*  raise money all week long. 10,000 hours per week is what senators and House members spend [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=884.5600000000001s)]
*  raising money. I've got a bill actually, that would preclude it from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. because [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=891.0400000000001s)]
*  it's such an unmitigated joke and disaster. The fact that in the United States that a PAC representing [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=895.9200000000001s)]
*  a special interest or corporation can hand a $5,000 check to a member of Congress at a steakhouse on [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=902.48s)]
*  Wednesday evening, and then that member serves on a committee in which that business or special [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=909.6s)]
*  interest has business in front of the next day, is the most unbelievable form of legal corruption [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=915.36s)]
*  you could possibly imagine. So that's one. Needless to say, I resolved right after that first week of [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=921.2s)]
*  orientation that I would do it differently. I befriended my Republican colleagues. My wife, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=926.64s)]
*  Annalise and I started having bipartisan dinners at our house. I joined the Problem Solvers Caucus. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=931.28s)]
*  I hope you guys know about it. It's the most important small caucus in Congress. We're now [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=936.0s)]
*  32 Democrats and 32 Republicans committed to doing what we're supposed to do. Get to know each other, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=939.92s)]
*  talk policy, and try to make a difference. Now, we're the workhorses, not the showhorses, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=946.4s)]
*  so you don't know most of our names, including me. But we were the ones invited to the White House [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=951.12s)]
*  in like week three of our service. I was one of four Democrats. There were four Republicans [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=957.04s)]
*  President Trump invited to the Situation Room to make a proposition to get us through the shutdown, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=961.76s)]
*  which I can talk about that bizarre hour of my life as well. And that's how I resolved to do it. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=967.12s)]
*  Now I'm ranked, depending on the survey, number one, number two, number 10, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=972.8s)]
*  most bipartisan members of the entire U.S. Congress and including governors. And I vote [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=977.84s)]
*  relatively progressive. It's not about just the votes. It's about the ethos. It's about [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=983.92s)]
*  Republican sponsored bills that come from me. It's about me sponsoring Republican led bills. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=988.3199999999999s)]
*  And that's what makes me a little bit different than I think just about every member of Congress, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=993.8399999999999s)]
*  not to mention, I think I'm the only one that's willing to torpedo a career so that the country [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=997.1999999999999s)]
*  isn't torpedoed by this nonsense and dysfunction. There's a lot more to talk about, but the it all [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1003.3599999999999s)]
*  starts with a systematic segregation and a focus on fighting each other instead of fighting for [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1008.9599999999999s)]
*  each other. I can talk about it all day long. Let's start there, Dean. What give us the assessment [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1014.32s)]
*  of what's happening in the White House right now? Before we talk about your candidacy, just like, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1019.2s)]
*  what's going on? Well, let me just say I respect President Biden. He's a man I've had in my house [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1023.5200000000001s)]
*  for an event. He's a man with whom I've flown on Air Force One twice. He did a beautiful video [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1030.4s)]
*  for my daughter. He called my mother. I think he did a fine job. I think he was the only man that [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1035.92s)]
*  could have defeated Donald Trump in 2020. And I have to say, I think it's fair to say too, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1041.36s)]
*  he's probably the only Democrat who could and will lose to Donald Trump in 2024. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1047.9199999999998s)]
*  He's a human being. He's now in his 80s. He is clearly on the decline. He's not incompetent. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1052.8799999999999s)]
*  I believe he surrounded himself by competent, able, principled people. And I believe the White [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1060.8799999999999s)]
*  House is running as a team, as most do. But do I think that he will be in a position to continue [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1065.76s)]
*  leading this country in the future? I do not. I think I'm joined by about 75% of the country [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1071.92s)]
*  in saying that. I also believe the policies that we pass, for the most part, are investments for [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1077.44s)]
*  the future. Infrastructure, the CHIPS Act, I think is a very important bill, which by the way has [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1081.92s)]
*  national security implications, as you guys know. The Inflation Reduction Act, a bizarre name for [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1086.72s)]
*  a bill that's really an energy and climate bill, I think is pretty good legislation. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1091.52s)]
*  And I think he reconstituted our allies around the world that had been frayed to a point of great [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1096.4s)]
*  danger during the Trump administration. So I salute the past. But this is really an election [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1101.12s)]
*  about the future. It's about a generational change. It's about creating really a new American [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1106.56s)]
*  century that will be powered by systems, structures, people, technologies, that I'm just afraid that [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1111.44s)]
*  President Biden and former President Trump can't even comprehend, let alone create thoughtful [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1118.08s)]
*  policy to both nurture and also manage. And I think that's where we're at. And I think we have [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1123.6s)]
*  wars overseas that I think in no small part are caused by a generation that is so focused on [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1129.6799999999998s)]
*  techniques and tools of the past that they can't even dare look to building peace for the future. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1136.24s)]
*  That's why we have the Middle East still going. That's why Ukraine, the vice president has some [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  ownership in some of these issues that I'm afraid have to be exposed. And they're the truth. And I'm [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1147.52s)]

*  States of America is absolutely the most challenging issue facing Americans. They don't believe that [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1157.2s)]
*  their government is listening. They don't believe the president understands. They don't believe [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1162.96s)]
*  Congress is able to do anything about it because we're so dysfunctional. And that's another mission [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1167.2s)]
*  that I'm on right now. To end this nonsense, I am going to build a team of rivals. I will have a [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1172.4s)]
*  White House and a cabinet comprised of both Democrats and Republicans, the most able leaders [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1176.64s)]
*  imaginable who have run multi-billion dollar organizations in some cases, understand customer [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1182.3200000000002s)]
*  service, will employ zero-based budgeting to the extent we can. We will employ a world-class [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1187.2s)]
*  consulting firm to look at every single government program, system, structure, and personnel to [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1192.16s)]
*  identify ways to save money. These are things that this president and frankly no president [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1200.4s)]
*  who doesn't have business experience, nonprofit leadership experience, and government experience [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1205.04s)]
*  could possibly imagine because they're so stuck in their siloed ways of thinking. He's been there [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1210.0s)]
*  for 50 years and it's time for change. I was two, three years old when he became a senator. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1215.12s)]
*  Aaron Ross Powell So let's get specific on the issues and go into foreign policy, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1219.76s)]
*  which is David Sachs's, I think, number one issue this election. But first, just to be clear on [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1224.32s)]
*  Biden, do you believe he's in cognitive decline? Do the Democrats privately believe he's in cognitive [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1229.68s)]
*  decline and to what extent? Do you think he'd make it through the next presidency? Or do you think [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1235.8400000000001s)]
*  this is sort of a Ronald Reagan situation where he might look back on it and he's got some early [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1240.48s)]
*  onset of some cognitive decline? What do you personally think and what do Democrats think? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1244.0s)]
*  David Sachs I don't want to impress upon anybody or give you the sense that I think he has a form of [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1247.68s)]
*  dementia or Alzheimer's or significant cognitive decline. But anybody who pays attention can see [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1254.64s)]
*  the change. People are saying that I'm causing his problems, I could risk his re-election. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1261.92s)]
*  I'm not the guy that has him losing to Trump nationally down in five of six battleground [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1269.44s)]
*  states, the lowest approval ratings in presidential history almost. And I'm certainly not the guy [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1273.76s)]
*  that has shown his decline. That's on video, that's on audio, you see it, it's natural. He's a human [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1280.16s)]
*  being for goodness sakes. All I'm doing, you guys, is saying the quiet part out loud. The only one. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1286.8799999999999s)]
*  You asked the question, do others talk about this? The question is, is anybody not talking about this? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1293.44s)]
*  Of course they are, you guys. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1299.6s)]
*  Pete Slauson They've really created an opportunity for you because like you said, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1300.8s)]
*  everyone's talking about this, but no one's willing to say it. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1304.08s)]
*  David Sachs Of course. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1307.04s)]
*  Pete Slauson What has been the blowback in the Democratic Party from your declaring? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1307.92s)]
*  David Sachs What do you think? I'm not being thrown flowers in parties, let me tell you that. Guys, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1311.68s)]
*  I'll tell you, I think most would consider me an affable, friendly, well-liked member of Congress. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1316.72s)]
*  I know that. That's my ethos. My friends are still my friends. I think they're disappointed [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1323.36s)]
*  because this is not what you do when you're a member of a party. You fall in line, you shush up, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1329.44s)]
*  you sit down, you get in line, and you do nothing to upset the apple cart of others who've been [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1333.68s)]
*  waiting in line perhaps a little longer than you. So, you can imagine the pushback has been strong, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1339.76s)]
*  the arrow's sharp, and the pain quite significant, but nothing compared to the pain that Americans [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1345.2s)]
*  are feeling right now and that's why I'm doing this. And I should also let you know, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1351.1200000000001s)]
*  I had no intention of doing this. A year ago, I was on a radio show and a host asked me if I [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1354.24s)]
*  thought the president should run again. And I said, of course not. He implicitly, if not [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1358.96s)]
*  explicitly said he would be a transitional president, kind of the bridge. Most members [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1363.68s)]
*  of Congress thought he was going to stand down. That's why Newsom and Pritzker and [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1367.8400000000001s)]
*  Whitmer and so many others were kind of making their plans. And I said, and if he doesn't pass [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1374.4s)]
*  the torch, then we should ensure at least that the stage has newer generation candidates to [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1379.68s)]
*  give voters a choice. Anyway, months went by. I started seeing the polls change dramatically. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1385.76s)]
*  The tenor and tone of constituent discussions with me and every single one of my colleagues was [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1391.12s)]
*  changing graphically. All the independents, moderate Republicans that voted for the president, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1395.44s)]
*  I think for the right reasons, were increasingly telling us that they're not going to do it again. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1400.32s)]
*  They may not vote for Trump, but they're not going to vote rather than vote for Biden. And over time, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1404.32s)]
*  it got to a point, actually, guys, where I resigned from the House leadership table [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1410.3200000000002s)]
*  because my position was so incongruent with those who were in positions to do something about it [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1415.04s)]
*  that I didn't feel it was appropriate for me to sit with them anymore. And I was really frustrated. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1421.6000000000001s)]
*  I called Gretchen Whitmer. I called J.B. Pritzker. I made public calls to the candidates whose names [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1426.4s)]
*  are better known than me to jump in. The water's warm, you guys. It's a Democratic primary. That's [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1431.52s)]
*  what we do. Not only did those two not take my calls, which they would have any other day, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1436.32s)]
*  they had their political operatives take those calls and they told me, please don't use their [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1441.4399999999998s)]
*  names. That's the culture. That's the culture, you guys, that we're dealing with. You will be [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1446.72s)]
*  blackballed. You will be disenfranchised. You will be let out the door if you so much as even [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1451.76s)]
*  issue a word that you might challenge a sitting president of the United States. This is the United [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1458.32s)]
*  States of America. It's appalling. Anyhow, I'm frustrated. We saw that happen with R.F.K. Jr. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1463.28s)]
*  because he declared initially as a Democrat and Biden wouldn't give him Secret Service Protection [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1469.28s)]
*  despite the enormous personal safety risks and threats. He's actually adding threats. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1475.04s)]
*  Which is the same thing for me, by the way, guys. You can imagine. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1480.08s)]
*  Yeah. Biggest line item in my budget right now, by the way, is security. The biggest line item, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1482.96s)]
*  the second biggest line item that's going to suppress that is getting onto the ballot. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1489.28s)]
*  Right. Well, that was the thing is they wouldn't let R.F.K. on the ballot. They wouldn't debate [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1494.3999999999999s)]
*  him. They just want to pretend like he didn't exist and they basically drove him out of the party. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1498.16s)]
*  So now he's running as an independent. Do you think you're going to be able to get on the ballot as a [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1501.28s)]
*  Democrat in these primaries? Absolutely. And we're making those choices right now, David, because [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1505.6s)]
*  first of all, it's obscene. I want to let you all know that in a country that prides itself on [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1510.72s)]
*  being a democracy, a Democratic Republic, I can't even tell you how many states literally [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1515.44s)]
*  create high barriers to entry to satisfy the two parties to ensure that their coronated candidate [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1521.76s)]
*  has an advantage over anybody else. I'm talking about the most egregious ones. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1528.96s)]
*  Give us an example of what you have to do. Oh, the most egregious are oftentimes the deepest blue. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1533.3600000000001s)]
*  New York is close to impossible. When I say impossible, explain it to us like what you [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1538.56s)]
*  have to do. So the reason I started in New Hampshire is it has a 103 year old tradition [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1543.68s)]
*  of being the first in the nation primary. They take this really seriously. They're the most [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1549.3600000000001s)]
*  engaged Americans in the country. They have a process that we walk through the snow. We answer [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1552.96s)]
*  their questions. And you also all you need is a thousand dollar check. You got to be 35 years old. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1557.92s)]
*  You got to be born in the United States of America and you too can become a candidate for [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1564.0800000000002s)]
*  president of the United States. That's what I did. They have the most beautiful ritual [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1569.04s)]
*  in the state house in Concord, New Hampshire that is worth going to one time just to see the majesty [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1572.88s)]
*  of filing for president of the United States. So there are 21 of us on the democratic side of [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1578.0800000000002s)]
*  the ballot because that's how it should be. Take a state like Virginia. Wait, wait, hold on. There's [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1582.72s)]
*  21 people running for the Democratic. But that's incredible. I had no idea. Yeah, Chamath, 21. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1587.68s)]
*  Marianne Williamson and I are the best known of those 21 because the president of the United [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1594.0s)]
*  States chose not to. So that's how you have it. You ask about other states though, New York, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1599.92s)]
*  Virginia, 450 to 500 thousand dollars to pay consulting firms to pay people 25, 26 dollars per [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1607.04s)]
*  signature to just sit outside and just say, hey, can we get your signature to get this guy on a ballot? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1617.28s)]
*  It's not grassroots. It's not old school caucusing democracy. It is pay to play. And we would need it. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1622.48s)]
*  We're going to have to raise probably six, maybe, I'm sorry, maybe less than that, maybe five million [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1630.48s)]
*  dollars. We have a staff of three people right now and legal counsel just to get my name on a [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1636.24s)]
*  primary ballot. It's absurd. Marianne Williamson, you know, she's not going to be able to. RFK as [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1643.76s)]
*  an independent, by the way, I think he should be. I'm not someone who I'm concerned about some of [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1650.0s)]
*  his positions, but I think he should be able to get on the ballot. It's you guys, it's absurd. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1654.72s)]
*  It's obnoxious. And what I've discovered in the last three weeks is going to be my mission after [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1659.3600000000001s)]
*  being president to fix because it is going to destroy the country from the inside. And that is [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1663.6000000000001s)]
*  why we have the kind of candidates we have year after year after year and Americans say there. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1668.8000000000002s)]
*  And that's why we have Trumpism. I like the fact that, you know, most people become politicians as [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1673.76s)]
*  a career. I've harped against this for a while. And so they have everything to lose if they stand [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1680.24s)]
*  up against the party and they stand up against the political establishment within which they're [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1686.4s)]
*  meant to operate. And therefore just a few people get to make all the decisions and control [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1690.96s)]
*  all the levers and everyone else is just a marionette. But they stay there forever, Dave. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1695.1200000000001s)]
*  They stay there forever. And there's no term limits, which is what we need. That's why we [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1699.76s)]
*  need them. The fact that you're self-made and you don't have anything to lose. You can leave [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1703.04s)]
*  Congress and you'll be fine. You're a citizen that can go back to work and do what you do. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1708.48s)]
*  And you're doing this as a service. You're doing this because of your interest in the country. It [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1713.68s)]
*  sounds like not to say that other folks don't, but they're largely going to be driven and [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1717.04s)]
*  unfortunately adversely affected by the fact that they have to fall within the way that the game is [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1721.84s)]
*  played in order to operate and will not stand up and say the things that need to be said in order [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1727.04s)]
*  for us to make progress and get out of these situations. But those are the perverse incentives. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1732.24s)]
*  I commend you for doing it. I'm glad it's possible. I think Jason, we should probably [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1736.88s)]
*  talk about the topic. We have two topics that I think we're all passionate here. The first is [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1739.92s)]
*  foreign policy. The second is the budget and our out of control spending. Let's start with Sachs. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1745.1200000000001s)]
*  You said you wanted hard questions. Welcome to the pod. Sachs, foreign policy. Let's go. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1750.64s)]
*  Let's bring it. Before we came on, you said hard questions. Let's go. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1754.5600000000002s)]
*  Please. Meet David Sachs. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1757.7600000000002s)]
*  Hey, David. Dean, you said a minute ago that one of the reasons why the world's on fire is because [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1759.0400000000002s)]
*  of the Biden administration's handling of foreign policies kind of led us to this point. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1766.88s)]
*  I think there was a really good example of this. A week ago, there was a new report out [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1770.4s)]
*  by a former UN Assistant Secretary General named Michael Vonder Schuylenberg. He worked at the UN [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1774.96s)]
*  for 34 years. He did a detailed study and reconstruction of what happened in March of [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1780.72s)]
*  2022, so the month after the war. And what he concluded is there was a bona fide deal on the [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1787.44s)]
*  table between Russia and Ukraine where Putin was willing to pull back and leave and leave [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1794.24s)]
*  the territorial integrity of Ukraine intact if Ukraine would agree not to become part of NATO. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1801.76s)]
*  And this is something that's been discussed. There have been many reports of this [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1807.52s)]
*  over the last several months. Ukrainian Proff to had a story about that. But now [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1811.52s)]
*  there's yet another confirmation that such a deal was available. And yet, Boris Johnson and Joe Biden [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1815.04s)]
*  said, no, we want to pressure Putin not work out a peace deal with him. And so thanks to [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1821.44s)]
*  Western intervention, that deal never happened. Now, we're 20 months later, and the Ukrainian [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1828.56s)]
*  counteroffensive has failed. It's been a fiasco. The casualties have been absolutely massive. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1834.56s)]
*  Nat. Horrifying. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1839.6000000000001s)]
*  Nat. Horrifying. You saw there was this article on Time Magazine, this new profile [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1839.92s)]
*  of Zelensky where his own aides and advisors say that he's delusional. He can't accept that they're [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1844.0800000000002s)]
*  losing the war. They furthermore say that even if the US provides more weapons, more aid, [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1849.44s)]
*  they don't have enough men, they don't have enough soldiers to use them. Things are going [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1854.24s)]
*  that badly. I think there's now a fear that Ukraine could collapse in the next year, even if [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1857.76s)]
*  we provide more aid. So I guess, you know, I know that early on in the war, you supported Biden's [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1862.4s)]
*  policy. I'm wondering, have events on the ground now changed your view at all? How do you feel [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1867.44s)]
*  about it today? Do you think it was a mistake not to try and work out a peace deal in those early [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1872.72s)]
*  months of the war? And if you were president, what would you try and do differently now to try and [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1877.9199999999998s)]
*  end this thing? Well, first of all, I think we have to back up to 2014 to talk about this, David. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1883.6s)]
*  You know, first of all, I've seen that reporting. I do not have confirmation [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1890.32s)]
*  of the validity of that. And if I did, I could talk about it more directly. But if that's the [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1894.32s)]
*  truth, I would first ask, did that include Crimea? And secondly, it is not the it's not a United [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1900.08s)]
*  States decision about whether or not Ukraine should agree to a peace deal. It is Ukraine's [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1906.48s)]
*  decision, plain and simple. But I do want to turn back the clock a little bit, because I think this [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1911.28s)]
*  all kind of plays together. But by the way, it didn't it didn't include Crimea. But Zelensky was [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1915.52s)]
*  willing to go for that deal. And it was the West who intervened and said, no, we want you to pressure [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1919.68s)]
*  Putin and fight. David, like I said, I never speak to him unless I can verify that myself. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1924.32s)]
*  And I've not seen that intelligence in the skiff. I've not seen that presented to me. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1929.28s)]
*  And by the way, there are some times where I don't know. Most times, none of us know everything. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1934.4s)]
*  If that is the case, I would absolutely answer this question differently. But based on what I [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1939.44s)]
*  do know, I want to turn back the clock to 2014. You know, this is where foreign policy matters. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1943.52s)]
*  You know, President Obama was a great orator, I think, an inspirational leader. You know, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1949.76s)]
*  he came to the US presidency with only organizing state legislative and a couple or few years of [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1954.72s)]
*  Senate experience as a very young man. And Joe Biden was his vice president. And when Vladimir [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1960.32s)]
*  Putin took Crimea easily, that set the tone for what's going on right now. And we have not done a [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1967.12s)]
*  very good job of prevention. That's true in health care. That is true in poverty. That is true in our [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1975.2s)]
*  foreign policy, which is, by the way, maybe what happens when you spend 83 billion a year on [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1982.32s)]
*  diplomacy and 850 billion a year on bombs and missiles. Not to mention, go back to Eisenhower [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1986.72s)]
*  and the military industrial complex, David, you well know this. It does. It controls a lot of our [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1994.08s)]
*  policy, because those who are making great profit find ways to influence those who open the piggy [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=1999.92s)]
*  banks. I think the Crimea moment in 2014, the writing was on the wall. That was Putin's test. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2006.16s)]
*  If I take an inch, maybe they'll give me a mile. And what happened during the Biden presidency, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2012.1599999999999s)]
*  of course, he took the mile. I think it has implications now, though, David, and all of you. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2016.96s)]
*  You know, if we do not do our best to support Ukraine in defending, I think it doesn't just [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2021.4399999999998s)]
*  send a message to Putin, a post-Putin Russia, which is going to be a failed nation with a brain [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2026.72s)]
*  drain and something we should talk about, but also sends a message to Iran, North Korea, and even [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2032.0s)]
*  China. And I want to talk about that, too, because I think we have a much brighter future with them [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2037.36s)]
*  than most people portray as it relates to Taiwan. And that's the sad truth, as we get ourselves into [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2041.44s)]
*  these situations that then layer up the consequences by withdrawing. And Afghanistan was another [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2046.64s)]
*  example of that. So to answer your question, had there been a peace deal at that point, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2053.2000000000003s)]
*  and the deal would have been, we'll give you your territory back in return for not entering NATO, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2058.56s)]
*  who in their right mind would say that was a bad deal? Who in their right mind, especially— [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2064.48s)]
*  Boris Johnson? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2069.6s)]
*  Well, by the way, that's where you get it when you get people like— [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2071.2s)]
*  Well, I'm going to make this case, as you guys know, for comprehensive new generation of leaders [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2074.08s)]
*  all around the world in our country and in others that are sick of this nonsense, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2078.64s)]
*  sick of the bloodshed, sick of enriching enterprise at the expense of human beings. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2082.56s)]
*  It happens here. It happens in Ukraine and Russia, and it's happening in the Middle East, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2086.64s)]
*  plain and simple. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2090.8s)]
*  Sax, anything else on foreign policy you want to go to? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2093.7599999999998s)]
*  Packing off now would be, I think, a shameful, horrible mistake. One thing I would argue right [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2095.68s)]
*  now, David, is those who are most likely going to be subject to Putin's terror, the countries in [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2102.0s)]
*  Europe, should be carrying a much bigger, bigger part of this load. We have 750 bases and installations [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2108.3199999999997s)]
*  around the world in 80 countries. We are the most dominant presence in world history of any [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2116.48s)]
*  government, and we spend more on our military than the next, I think, 11 nations combined, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2121.04s)]
*  for gosh sakes. And if anyone thinks that a kinetic risk to the United States is the most likely harm [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2126.4s)]
*  that will be done us, not cyber or not social or not biological, I think you're out of your mind. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2133.12s)]
*  Those are the risks that I think are most threatening, that I think this president does [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2139.84s)]
*  not quite understand, and we have to recomprise and recommit to diplomacy and defending ourselves [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2143.7599999999998s)]
*  against the most important literal risks, including nuclear weapons that can be carried [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2149.92s)]
*  in a backpack and detonated in New York or Tel Aviv or anywhere in the world. And if we don't [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2155.28s)]
*  start changing how we do things, we're not going to be ready, and we are just sitting still [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2160.64s)]
*  in dysfunction. I'm going to change it. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2167.92s)]
*  Let's talk about China for one second, and I'll give it to you in two arcs. Arc number one, [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2170.0s)]
*  the comments that President Xi made yesterday, which were very, if you just heard them or read [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2174.8799999999997s)]
*  them, were very specific. We have zero desire to seek Chinese hegemony. We have zero desire to find [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2181.8399999999997s)]
*  a cold or hot war, which was, but then there was what wasn't said, which is part of what you said, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2190.8799999999997s)]
*  which is, well, okay, maybe there's no kinetic war, but the cyber risk is still there. And [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2197.7599999999998s)]
*  actually, the psychological war risk is there. So two questions. One is, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2203.12s)]
*  how do you react to what President Xi said last night? And then the second is, how do you react [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2210.24s)]
*  to what's happening with this TikTok Osama bin Laden, PsyOP thing that just seems to be, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2215.44s)]
*  frankly, just getting out of control here? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2221.6s)]
*  I agree. Well, let me say I was so pleased to see President Xi's remarks. I think President [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2224.24s)]
*  Biden responded by saying we should trust but verify. I think that's appropriate. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2230.56s)]
*  I was troubled, though, when a question was shouted out to President Biden on his way out about [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2234.48s)]
*  whether he considered President Xi a dictator. And he said, yes, he's a dictator. And I think [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2239.7599999999998s)]
*  that may have undermined this entire rapprochement, which I think is terribly important. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2243.92s)]
*  Words matter. The playbook matters. And the negligence or ignorance of another culture, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2250.72s)]
*  as it digests our words, our actions, our intentions, is very consequential. And [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2258.32s)]
*  unfortunately, we see this pattern with the president of doing what he did today in using [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2265.04s)]
*  that term. Whether or not it's really true or not, there are ways, as we all know, to simply [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2269.84s)]
*  not comment, because that is going to undermine, I think, a very important, otherwise very promising [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2275.76s)]
*  outcome. And to your question, I'm concerned that we have made China perhaps into the very enemy [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2280.8s)]
*  that ostensibly now our military industrial complex wants to defend us from, which happens [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2290.6400000000003s)]
*  time and time and time again through our history. And it concerns me deeply. We should be partnering [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2296.32s)]
*  with China. Our disagreements are real. I think they should be litigated and bridged with diplomacy, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2302.2400000000002s)]
*  not destruction. And imagine what can be accomplished in this 21st century world [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2309.68s)]
*  if two nations like ours recognize the potential of spending less on destruction and more on human [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2314.96s)]
*  beings. It astounds me. Do you think TikTok itself is a threat to the United States? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2323.12s)]
*  TikTok. Would you, if you were president, ban it or force them to divest and remove the servers [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2329.9199999999996s)]
*  in China and the algorithm from China, et cetera? I'll make this really simple. Do you think it's [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2334.3999999999996s)]
*  actually being used for PSYOPs? I'll make this really simple. You know, if we want to change [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2337.2s)]
*  our constitution and change what we consider speech, change how the federal government or any [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2341.8399999999997s)]
*  domestic government affects people's rights to what they watch, what they read, what they eat, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2348.7999999999997s)]
*  how they pray, how they think, where they go, with whom they congregate. You know what? That's up to [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2353.6s)]
*  Americans. But I think to target one app is a huge mistake. And I have a very simple solution. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2358.3999999999996s)]
*  Hold every single platform to the same standard, transparency via their algorithm, have an [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2365.76s)]
*  independent commission perhaps that is charged and responsible with assessing and holding those [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2373.36s)]
*  platforms to account. And if any of them violate the terms that we pass into law, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2379.76s)]
*  then they should be banned. But to target one, I think it's not sensible. Well, we do have foreign [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2385.1200000000003s)]
*  ownership rules for media outlets, yeah. Sure. So this has many more users and is much more powerful [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2389.28s)]
*  with the algorithm. So then how would you respond to that sort of counter argument? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2394.72s)]
*  I'm just going to say this. If we want to change our constitution, this is what the Supreme Court, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2399.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm afraid, is going to say if we start doing this, then change the constitution. That's what [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2404.72s)]
*  they said, by the way, about women's reproductive rights. You know, in the absence of Congress doing [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2408.3199999999997s)]
*  anything, in the absence of that, we're going to assess it the way it reads. Right now, I don't [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2413.2s)]
*  think that's necessarily really possible without a significant Supreme Court challenge. My belief is [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2418.24s)]
*  yes. Is it a threat? Yes, it's a threat. By the way, every social media platform is a threat when [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2422.96s)]
*  used by malign actors. You know, Nikki Haley. Do you think we should force reciprocity if they, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2428.56s)]
*  if we allow TikTok, they allow Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and China? I think that's the kind of [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2433.2s)]
*  thinking Jason and I like. In fact, reciprocity as it relates to IP, enforcement of IP, of theft, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2437.92s)]
*  of trade. You just hit the nail on the head. Reciprocity. You know, let's be reciprocal in [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2444.7200000000003s)]
*  the nature of a relationship. If you're going to ban our apps and our platforms, or our products, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2451.28s)]
*  or our brands, well, why, this is to me an opportunity for the next generation to say, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2456.2400000000002s)]
*  this is nonsensical. You know, if you're going to succeed, by the way, China, you all know, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2461.52s)]
*  has significant, they have a bubble they're facing that will make ours in 2008 look like a [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2466.0800000000004s)]
*  gumball by comparison. And that is coming down the pipe. I think that has a lot to do with this [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2472.4s)]
*  kind of step towards rapprochement. But yes, reciprocity and to know that Facebook is not [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2477.6s)]
*  allowed. Yeah, perfect example. But in the United States, that doesn't change my contention that we [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2483.12s)]
*  should set the same standard for every platform, every media entity, whatever it might be, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2488.72s)]
*  hold them accountable. And if they don't qualify or perform, then they're banned. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2494.7999999999997s)]
*  Give us your just maybe societal then commentary on the number of people on TikTok right now. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2498.3199999999997s)]
*  Advocating for I don't even know what you want to call it, I guess, reading and sympathizing. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2506.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, with those sounds. It's just, first of all, I'm sure you guys do too. I look at TikTok. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2512.96s)]
*  I consume as much media as many platforms as possible. So I understand why some of the [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2518.48s)]
*  nonsensical perspectives are being shared with me by so many people right now. So I get it. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2524.2400000000002s)]
*  You're funny, but back to the fundamental question, what do we do? And this has been, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2529.6800000000003s)]
*  by the way, an age old issue since our very founding, it used to be anonymous pamphlets [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2533.04s)]
*  that would spread misinformation or condemnation and, and fire people up. Now it's just instantly [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2536.88s)]
*  available. It doesn't matter if you have a printer, you can push a button. And yes, am I concerned? [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2542.32s)]
*  Of course I am. I'm the fact that when I'm spending time on college campuses right now, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2547.04s)]
*  and listening to otherwise really well educated privileged kids, saying things that are so [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2551.6s)]
*  nonsensical, so ignorant and so shocking, I know where it's coming from. So I understand the problem, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2558.72s)]
*  just like all of you. I think this question is what do you do about it? And all I'm saying is we [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2564.16s)]
*  should have the same standard for every platform because the same issue is on every platform. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2568.08s)]
*  That is my only contention. What do you think about, you're about to say this, but what do [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2572.56s)]
*  you think about what Nikki Haley suggested? I was shocked that people- [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2576.3999999999996s)]
*  Maybe just frame for the listeners who don't know what she said. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2582.08s)]
*  So Nikki Haley, and I asked Mark Zuckerberg this once or two, I'll tell you. Nikki Haley proposed [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2584.72s)]
*  that every platform, every social media platform have verified accounts, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2589.8399999999997s)]
*  no more anonymous accounts. And she got ripped, got ripped. I understand this is, this is, [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2594.16s)]
*  it's a reasonable argument to have, but I got to tell you, I'm surprised that that's something that [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2601.3599999999997s)]
*  seems somewhat reasonable to people who are paying attention would have such a response that she [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2605.8399999999997s)]
*  actually retracted it. I'm not proposing it. I'm just saying that I think we should be throwing [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2611.52s)]
*  ideas on the table. And I know from experience, just like you guys, when you hide behind a fake [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2615.7599999999998s)]
*  name, you can be not just a jerk to someone, you can be downright dangerous. When your name's [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2620.08s)]
*  attached to it, you behave in a very different manner, not mentioned when you're face to face. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2625.2s)]
*  So I don't think that was as absurd as people considered it. I asked Mark Zuckerberg after a [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2629.52s)]
*  financial services hearing a couple of years ago, you know, why doesn't Facebook just verify accounts, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2634.72s)]
*  make this so much easier to hold people accountable and have higher standards of [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2639.68s)]
*  accountability? And he said it would be a competitive disadvantage. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2644.48s)]
*  And of course it is, if he only had to do it. Yeah, and this has been tested. Korea had their [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2648.8799999999997s)]
*  version of this in order to sign up in Korea for their social networks or ISPs, you have to use [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2654.48s)]
*  your social security numbers. Sure, that makes sense. And the other thing, guys, is you know, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2659.6s)]
*  if you write a letter to the editor of most major newspapers, you have to, you have to attach your [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2662.7999999999997s)]
*  name to it. It has to be verified. I just think it's a conversation that we should be having. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2667.52s)]
*  And by the way, you know, it might be time to read Future Shock again by Alvin Toffler, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2674.0s)]
*  who predicted so much of this mess in which we find ourselves, the incapacity of human beings [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2677.68s)]
*  to adapt to such rapid technological change, which by the way, you know, you on this, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2683.68s)]
*  you just the handful of you on this, on this podcast, have more expertise than the entire [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2690.08s)]
*  United States Senate and Congress combined as it relates to the issues we're talking about. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2697.12s)]
*  On tech, there is no capacity, no competency. So on whom do we rely? The very lobbyists being [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2702.16s)]
*  paid by the very enterprises that so easily can set the standards. Right. There aren't people [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2708.4s)]
*  of better capacity. And only 11 members of Congress have an engineering degree. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2714.24s)]
*  Only 11. By the way, I was, I was on Kevin McCarthy invited me to join his AI cabinet, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2718.56s)]
*  which just it was a few for Democrats about four Republicans. We had our first meeting and started [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2724.8s)]
*  making plans right before he was deposed. And now I don't know anything if anything's going on in [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2729.68s)]
*  that respect. Where do you stand on the spectrum of decorum online on one end, and free speech on [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2735.28s)]
*  the other, where the absolutists would say, absolutely not verified accounts as a non-starter, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2742.24s)]
*  because it just fundamentally undermines the First Amendment and this other thing, which is [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2747.28s)]
*  more organized decorum. Chamath, it's it. I think that's the issue of our day. Maybe the most [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2752.4s)]
*  important when it's true, both online. It's also true in our Congress right now. Where's that [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2757.6000000000004s)]
*  intersection between debate and discord and, and comprehensive division? I don't have the good [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2761.1200000000003s)]
*  answer for it right now is the truth. And I'm afraid that if you interpret our constitution, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2769.36s)]
*  you know, free speech has to be met with more free speech. But I'll tell you that, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2774.4s)]
*  but that also will conflict and increasingly is with the right to pursue happiness. I mean, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2778.7200000000003s)]
*  that's just true. I mean, it's a, it's a, it's the most complicated issue in our era. What I like to [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2784.4s)]
*  see our kids safer, our mental health and emotional health improve and the division reduced and [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2791.12s)]
*  misinformation and disinformation rectified, of course, because I do think- [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2796.88s)]
*  Would you put a minimum age on use of social networks? You have kids, would you make it 15, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2800.96s)]
*  16 years old? I think it would be healthier. Look, we have minimum age for alcohol. That's, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2805.28s)]
*  you know, that's older than you have to be to fight in a war. For God's sakes, it's ridiculous. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2810.08s)]
*  You know, we have cannabis is cannabis is still banned at the federal, the hypocrisy of the [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2815.68s)]
*  federal government is also what I'm running against right now. So Jason, I think that is a [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2819.84s)]
*  good idea. You know this, and I've had daughters that grew up in the social media era. It is one [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2823.6s)]
*  of the most destructive. It is far, it is as destructive as I think drug consumption to [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2829.2s)]
*  adolescent health as anything else. So to answer your question, I think that's A, perfectly legal, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2834.16s)]
*  B, perfectly reasonable. And you can't just entrust parents to do it because [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2838.8799999999997s)]
*  Johnny's parents will allow them to have the phone and the apps, you know, and Jill's won't. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2842.96s)]
*  And he can't, there has to be, I think there has to be, we do that for a lot of other things. And [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2847.7599999999998s)]
*  I think we should talk about at what age any of this is reasonable, but absolutely, I think that's [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2851.9199999999996s)]
*  not unreasonable. I want kids to be safe, just like you guys. And so does everybody. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2856.32s)]
*  It sounds like driving a car is a good match for 15, 16, 17 years old. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2859.2000000000003s)]
*  We should also allow kids to learn how to drink before they learn how to drive. We're the only [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2862.6400000000003s)]
*  country that does it like this, you know, drive for five years until you legally can drink. So when [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2865.84s)]
*  you have your first drink, you don't even know what it's going to do to you. You know, it's absurd. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2870.48s)]
*  Freiburg. I know we're going to talk about spending in a second, but just before we get away from [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2874.2400000000002s)]
*  foreign policy, I think it's important that we ask what would be your goals with respect to conflict [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2878.48s)]
*  in the Middle East? What's the strategy you'd employ to achieve those goals? And who are the [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2885.2s)]
*  people that you'd surround yourself with? Well, I'll tell you, my strategy is quite simple. It's [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2889.4399999999996s)]
*  peace around the world and it's prosperity at home, plain and simple. And I can build, I can put the [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2894.08s)]
*  legs of that stool together for you as quickly as I possibly can. But let's talk about the Middle [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2899.12s)]
*  East. You know, I'm 54 years old. President Biden has been in the US Senate or in the White House [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2903.9199999999996s)]
*  for 50 years. None of us on this podcast have lived through anything but bloodshed, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2910.0s)]
*  reciprocal misery between Palestinians and Israelis. This cycle has continued for decades. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2916.48s)]
*  I've had enough. I cannot stand the sight of babies being pulled from the wombs of mothers [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2922.56s)]
*  by Hamas and Israel any more than I can watch babies being destroyed by bombs and missiles in [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2929.36s)]
*  Gaza. And it's got to stop. I am about to issue a statement to that end that says, essentially, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2934.64s)]
*  Hamas must release all of its hostages, period, of which there are nine Americans, guys. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2941.7599999999998s)]
*  Nine Americans are being held in Gaza by a terrorist organization. And as president, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2947.6s)]
*  I would be making that my, not my daily desire or request, my daily demand, all hands on deck, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2953.04s)]
*  these hostages must be released immediately. Would you send in special forces to collect them? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2959.52s)]
*  I would. Absolutely. It is the it is incumbent on the president of the United States to extract [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2963.76s)]
*  Americans being held against their will by any foreign entity. I don't know. Got to ask him. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2968.0800000000004s)]
*  But good luck asking him because he doesn't do any press conferences. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2973.6800000000003s)]
*  The goal for peace is reasonable. But but these like maybe some specifics around your [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2976.32s)]
*  strategy. So let me. Yeah. So, yeah. Okay. So first, at the at the moment the hostages [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2980.88s)]
*  are safely released, there should be a ceasefire, period. And at that very moment, there should be [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2985.5200000000004s)]
*  a multinational peacekeeping force sent into Gaza to maintain security immediately. When I say [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2990.72s)]
*  multinational, the very nations that are connected to Gaza, Arab nations have to be part of it, not [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=2995.8399999999997s)]
*  the United States, not Israel, of course, but a significant force there to keep the peace [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3000.9599999999996s)]
*  immediately. Concurrently, a multinational coalition designed to eliminate Hamas by every [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3005.6s)]
*  nation in the world that wants them eliminated, which frankly is most. And then we have got to [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3011.52s)]
*  invest again, nations of the world investing in a democratic civil society, infrastructure, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3017.04s)]
*  education, facilities and security so that a new generation of Palestinian leaders can create a [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3023.76s)]
*  circumstance whereby another nation can be created, period. And it's not going to happen [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3030.88s)]
*  with Israel and Palestinians trying to do this. It has got to be imposed. It has got to be a [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3035.52s)]
*  coalition of the willing. And then only then and only then will we see the conditions for [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3040.88s)]
*  hopefully elections for Palestinians for the first time since 2006, 17 years. And concurrently, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3046.56s)]
*  it is time for Israelis to call an election to replace Benjamin Netanyahu because he is absolutely [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3053.52s)]
*  part of Israel's security problem. I've looked him in the eye. I told him before this happened [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3060.0s)]
*  earlier this year, I've been with him twice, looked him in the eye. I said, what you are doing [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3064.64s)]
*  is affecting the relationship with the United States and Israel and will absolutely affect [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3069.6s)]
*  security moving forward. I had no idea what would be coming on October 7th. But the settlement [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3074.64s)]
*  policy, the right-wing government, the distraction that the judicial reform initiative has created [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3079.2s)]
*  in that country made the conditions ripe. And by the way, having been in Riyadh recently too, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3085.2799999999997s)]
*  it was really getting close. The Saudis and Israelis normalizing. And that was exactly why [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3091.68s)]
*  I believe whether implicit or explicit, Iran inspired Hamas to do this then. And by the way, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3096.72s)]
*  in the United States, mark my words, there are our adversaries are watching the dysfunction [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3102.8799999999997s)]
*  and distraction right now with the same open eyes. And we have borders that are awfully easily [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3108.64s)]
*  to get in. And that's the truth. And I'm a Democrat saying that I would do this entirely [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3115.2799999999997s)]
*  differently. Can you actually talk about the border? Tell us what would you do there? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3119.8399999999997s)]
*  Once again, I've got a lot of colleagues who make their decisions by reading an article, [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3124.08s)]
*  seeing a tweet or seeing a TikTok. I go, you know, I've been to Israel and the Middle East [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3128.7200000000003s)]
*  twice just in the last number of months. I've been to the southern border twice. I've seen with my [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3134.7200000000003s)]
*  own eyes. It is the most despicable, embarrassing failure of American policy I have ever seen. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3138.0s)]
*  I have seen women walking across the Rio Grande with babies in their arms who have spent six or [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3145.1200000000003s)]
*  $7,000, their whole life savings, paid to gangs and coyotes to bring them across the border. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3150.48s)]
*  I've seen the extraordinary beauty and grace with which border patrol agents have looked after these [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3158.48s)]
*  people. I've seen babies who were abandoned that were on 24 hour care of border patrol agents who [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3163.36s)]
*  took as good a care of these little kids as they would their own. I saw people in cages. I saw the [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3169.52s)]
*  most archaic out of date, inefficient, ineffective ports of entry. I saw lines of trailer trucks, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3174.48s)]
*  probably two, three miles long idling in the hot weather waiting to get across. I saw a mile long [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3183.68s)]
*  of human beings waiting to come into the country to do their shopping or their job or their education [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3190.4s)]
*  and it was horrifying. And if we think, by the way, we need much better border security, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3196.08s)]
*  barriers, technologies and facilities. And by the way, we also need it at the northern border. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3201.12s)]
*  I'm a border state in Minnesota. People walk across farm fields in Manitoba into Minnesota. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3206.3199999999997s)]
*  We don't know who they are. Some of them get caught. That's true. But I'll tell you guys, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3210.56s)]
*  if we think that we can solve the problem at the border, that's the issue right there. This [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3215.2s)]
*  administration and past ones just don't get it. We should be adjudicating asylum cases in countries [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3219.6s)]
*  of origin. Why make these poor people take their life savings that they have no money? They're [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3225.6s)]
*  set off in the streets here. They're supposed to come back to a court two years from now. Let them [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3230.88s)]
*  keep their money. Let's build dormitories next to our consulates or our embassies in the northern [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3235.76s)]
*  triangle countries, wherever migrants are coming. Create some safety security there. Invest in local [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3240.32s)]
*  economies so that there can be some opportunity and adjudicate their cases there. If they qualify, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3245.84s)]
*  let's bring them to America with six or seven thousand dollars in their pocket so they can [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3251.28s)]
*  start a nice new life and pursue the American dream. And if they don't, they will be kept in [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3256.64s)]
*  their countries of origin. And of course, we have to work with Mexico as well. But this is not rocket [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3260.96s)]
*  science. It's simple problem solving. And the fact that we continue to do this stupid policy to this [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3265.04s)]
*  day, you guys, is on the other side of this talk about recruiting many countries, Canada, New Zealand, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3270.16s)]
*  a lot of the Nordics have a point based system and they actively recruit talent. You're an entrepreneur. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3276.16s)]
*  You've been CEO of multiple companies. It is an absolute arduous pain to get talented people here [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3281.36s)]
*  right now. Recruitment of talent in the United States is bundled with the southern border. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3286.96s)]
*  How would you decouple that? Would you be in favor of a point based system and recruitment of talent [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3291.6s)]
*  to get more talented immigrants in our country? Which, by the way, three of the four besties here [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3295.36s)]
*  were not born in the United States. And by the way, my foremothers and forefathers came here [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3301.04s)]
*  for the same reasons. Same reasons that every one of those moms and dads is coming across the Rio Grande. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3305.52s)]
*  So, to answer your question directly, Jason, I think we can do both. I think we should have a [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3310.0s)]
*  merit based system to attract the best and brightest and most talented. I'm sure all of you [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3314.24s)]
*  came from enterprises that would afford benefits, perhaps education to people. You would expect them [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3318.56s)]
*  to actually stay at your enterprise for a number of years to kind of as a payback. We are right now, [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3323.76s)]
*  the United States is training some of the best and brightest in the world, not creating opportunities [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3328.32s)]
*  to stay. And of course, Canada is the beneficiary, the Nordic countries, European countries, you guys [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3332.88s)]
*  know this. This notion that we can't do two things at once, that we can't welcome the most [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3336.88s)]
*  disadvantaged who simply want to pursue an American dream and start at the very bottom [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3342.56s)]
*  and match that with some of the best and brightest who can actually start at the very top. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3347.84s)]
*  My goodness. Why does everything have to be binary, you guys? Black and white, good or bad, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3351.36s)]
*  yes or no? It's nonsense. Before we run out of time. Oh darn, that's way too short. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3356.2400000000002s)]
*  No, for you. I think we got a little overtime. I got time, guys. Oh, okay, great. We really want [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3361.52s)]
*  to talk. I got time, yeah. Freberg and I are, I think Freberg, you know, moved me to his position [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3366.4s)]
*  on this. Number one issue for this election, Freberg, correct me if I'm wrong, for you, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3373.76s)]
*  is still our out of control spending. Freberg, maybe you could tee this up. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3377.36s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I've said this in the past. I think the US is facing a fiscal emergency [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3381.6s)]
*  in the sense that arithmetic starts to play out that the cost of debt spirals, we can't accomplish [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3386.56s)]
*  any of the other stuff we're talking about unless we can figure this out. We have $33 trillion of [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3391.84s)]
*  debt today. The Treasury estimates it's going to grow to $47 trillion by 2033, just 10 years away. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3395.68s)]
*  $1.5 trillion in deficit this year, $1 trillion in debt interest expense alone this year, and a third [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3402.8799999999997s)]
*  of our debt is coming up to be refinanced soon. It's going to get refinanced at 4.5% interest rate [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3407.7599999999998s)]
*  instead of 2, 2.5% it's sitting at today. So the interest will swell, the deficit will swell, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3412.8799999999997s)]
*  the debt will swell, and we're already taxing 18% of GDP as federal revenue, which a lot of economists [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3418.8799999999997s)]
*  have shown. You can only get to 20% at which point economy starts to shrink. There's, I think, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3425.44s)]
*  pretty good research on this. Some would argue differently, but I think that's kind of a natural [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3430.8s)]
*  limit. So the only kind of response is what's wrong with spending? Like, why do we have the [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3434.2400000000002s)]
*  spending problem? I guess the question for you is what is causing structurally the spending problem? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3441.28s)]
*  A lot of people have said that this is late stage empire, the failure of democracy because everyone [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3447.84s)]
*  votes themselves all the money eventually. Or is it a politically oriented problem where folks [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3453.12s)]
*  don't want to address the biggest line items? They don't want to hold programs to account? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3458.96s)]
*  And what is the answer here? So to answer your question directly, you ask what the cause is, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3463.8399999999997s)]
*  it's incompetency and perverse incentives. Period. There's no political, there used to be a political [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3468.64s)]
*  reward for conservatives who were focused on fiscal responsibility because they would win elections [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3475.2s)]
*  over tax and spenders. But that party is long gone, long gone. There's no reward. That's why [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3480.8s)]
*  Trump added $7 trillion to the deficit. And that's why Biden will probably add about that much as [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3487.28s)]
*  well. So by the way, I think I'm one of the only Democrats who has been named by the Committee for [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3492.32s)]
*  a Responsible Federal Budget, one of their fiscal heroes as a Democrat. And also I'm a Hamilton [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3498.32s)]
*  Jefferson Award winner by the US Chamber of Commerce. And I'm also pro-worker. This notion [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3505.92s)]
*  that you can't be, by the way, pro-business and pro-worker, that they're somehow mutually exclusive, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3510.7200000000003s)]
*  that's BS. They're mutually mandatory. But back to your question, 30 through trillion in debt, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3515.52s)]
*  by the way, our economy can accommodate more. That's the sad truth. The issue is our debt [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3520.48s)]
*  service. And nobody's talking about the fact that it is going to go from mid-$400 billion a year to [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3524.7200000000003s)]
*  to your point, Dave, with the higher interest rates, probably approaching a trillion, maybe 840. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3530.08s)]
*  It's already over a trillion. It's a trillion one today. It's going to be a trillion five. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3534.4s)]
*  Well, let's see. I would argue that maybe we could have a little argument about if it's there quite [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3536.96s)]
*  yet. But either way, let's call it a trillion. That means literally we are spending way more [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3543.44s)]
*  for the past than we are investing in the future. That means we have literally no dollars left for [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3551.36s)]
*  any discretionary spending. Every bit of it is now consumed by Social Security, Medicare, and our [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3556.7999999999997s)]
*  military. And on top of that, we've got people sleeping on the streets in every single town and [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3561.68s)]
*  city in America. We have kids going to school hungry. We have one of the most, to me, failing [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3570.3199999999997s)]
*  public school systems in the entire developed world. We have a health care system that is not [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3576.08s)]
*  health care. It's sick care. A fee-for-service model that should be capitated. And our outcomes [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3580.48s)]
*  are mid-pack. And we have a $2 trillion deficit. And by the way, no child care, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3586.16s)]
*  no pre-K education. I can go on down the list. It's nonsensical. And we're spending $2 trillion [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3590.96s)]
*  more. So to answer your question, you guys know the answer here. We're a country with, I think, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3597.04s)]
*  $150-some-trillion in total United States household wealth. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3602.08s)]
*  Where do you cut? Let's start by getting into those specifics. Do you cut entitlements? Do you [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3609.92s)]
*  cut military? Where do you cut? And how do you cut? So here's what I would do, starting with [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3615.68s)]
*  Social Security. Social Security, you guys, is the most successful anti-poverty program [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3621.2s)]
*  in world history. And I believe it would be not just a dereliction of duty. It would be countered [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3626.96s)]
*  to every American principle if senior citizens struggled. By the way, we don't have a culture [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3632.72s)]
*  in America that takes care of the elders, like in most Asian cultures and other wonderful cultures [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3639.2799999999997s)]
*  in the world. So absent that, we have to afford resources. So two things. As you all know, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3644.32s)]
*  Social Security, the trust fund, will face probably reductions in 25, at about 25% cut levels by 2033 [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3649.6800000000003s)]
*  based on the current path. Two easy things we can do. $160,000 a year is the cap right now, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3657.04s)]
*  I think, roughly. We should make that $250,000. That means it's a very regressive tax. If you're [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3663.36s)]
*  making $160,000, you're paying a whole lot more of your income than someone making $250,000, $300,000 [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3668.72s)]
*  a year, not to mention $3 million or $30 million. So we should raise the cap to $250,000, make sure [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3674.08s)]
*  that fund at least is solvent through probably 2046, 2047. And then I would do something different [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3679.3599999999997s)]
*  for the first time in American history. For all the millions of Americans who've done well, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3685.7599999999998s)]
*  don't need their Social Security, that wish to become philanthropists, I would create a pool, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3690.9599999999996s)]
*  not that goes back to the Treasury, a pool that would be automatically redistributed to the lowest [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3696.16s)]
*  5% or 10% of all Social Security recipients in the entire country. And let's say it might be a $500 [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3702.56s)]
*  boost, it might be a $1,000 boost a year for the most challenged elderly Americans. But when 40% [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3708.3199999999997s)]
*  of Americans can't afford a $400 car repair or emergency expense, you know, that's literally- [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3715.52s)]
*  Well, to your point- [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3721.44s)]
*  Not for this group, but- [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3722.16s)]
*  No, to your point, I think it was the Fed or it was Treasury that published a study, I was shocked [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3723.44s)]
*  by the actual number of American millionaires that exist. And it's counter to the narrative, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3728.2400000000002s)]
*  because you would- [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3734.8s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3735.36s)]
*  If you just read the headlines, you think America is in economic despair, and it's not true. And [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3735.6s)]
*  the wealth creation is actually quite pervasive, which is a great feature of American capitalism. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3741.36s)]
*  So to your point, there probably are a lot of people who would be willing to pay it forward [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3746.7200000000003s)]
*  to folks that didn't have it if you gave them the choice, it's just not possible today. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3751.68s)]
*  So why shouldn't we be a government that creates- So just, Chamath, if I could just say, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3755.04s)]
*  one of my perspectives and intentions is to not necessarily- By the way, we don't have to spend [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3759.2799999999997s)]
*  money to expose young people who never get out of their neighborhoods in many cities in this country, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3765.12s)]
*  expose them to possibility, you know, get them into factories, into ad agencies, into high tech [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3770.56s)]
*  centers, show them rockets, and music makers and artists. We don't need to spend a whole lot more [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3775.84s)]
*  money to simply completely change the path of young Americans' lives, not to mention old [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3784.1600000000003s)]
*  Americans' lives. And that's just a perfect example of a simple solution that costs zero and lets [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3789.52s)]
*  Americans actually be Americans. So- [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3795.6800000000003s)]
*  Okay, so now go to Medicare, but I think I know what you're going to say, because you [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3798.2400000000002s)]
*  mentioned it, capitation, but maybe talk very quickly on that and then military. What do you- [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3802.24s)]
*  Yeah, so quickly on healthcare, look guys, I represent United Health Group in my district. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3806.8799999999997s)]
*  Tens of thousands of Minnesotans, many of them who live in my district, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3813.12s)]
*  earn very handsome salaries from United. They've done some great work in many ways, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3816.72s)]
*  but I have to tell you, since I've joined Congress in my third term now, you would be in tears if you [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3821.68s)]
*  had to sit with the people that I've sat with over so many occasions who thought they had coverage, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3828.56s)]
*  whose son got sick, or whose mother broke a leg or something, and they literally have [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3834.48s)]
*  gone bankrupt or take on tens of thousands of dollars in medical debt and they get surprise [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3840.96s)]
*  bills. And then they read in the paper that their health insurer reported annual net income of over [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3845.68s)]
*  $20 billion. And I don't know how you guys feel, but I got to tell you, I'm a capitalist. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3851.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm also compassionate, and I can no longer reconcile that. I really can't. There's a reason [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3858.0s)]
*  we're the only nation in the world that does it this way. I think it's time the way, by the way, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3862.88s)]
*  from Roosevelt to Truman to Richard Nixon. Richard Nixon proposed universal health coverage, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3867.2s)]
*  and it was Ted Kennedy that undermined it, if you can imagine that. If we don't, if conservatives [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3872.56s)]
*  and progressives don't come to the table and talk about how we can deliver a national health [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3877.6s)]
*  insurance program that is portable, let's gig economy participants do their thing, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3882.4s)]
*  that people don't have to make choices about where to work just because of the health care. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3887.44s)]
*  I don't know why we wouldn't talk about that. And by the way, I'm not talking about the provision [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3891.28s)]
*  of care. It's really important because Fox News and some Republicans have tried to say this is a [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3894.8s)]
*  socialized solution. Just the coverage, because the money is in the system already between [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3898.8s)]
*  3, 4, 5, 6x pharma costs between 2x health per capita health costs, 10,000 per person compared [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3903.84s)]
*  to any country in the world at 5. The answer is, I think, right there in front of us. The money's in [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3912.2400000000002s)]
*  the system. It would not require a tax increase. I think we could actually save substantial money. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3916.8s)]
*  I'm working on a proposition right now. I would argue that the model is part of the problem. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3921.1200000000003s)]
*  Fee for service is antithetical to what we need. We need a capitated model that gives an incentive [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3926.08s)]
*  to the providers to keep people out of the hospital. At least try. At least try. So that's [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3931.28s)]
*  the answer on that. And by the way, right now, Medicare, as you probably know, I think 23% [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3938.32s)]
*  of the country, or no, between Medicare and the VA, which are single payer systems, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3944.8s)]
*  25% of Americans right now are covered by a single payer system. And by the way, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3950.0s)]
*  it works better than the other system. Medicare recipients are pretty pleased. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3954.8s)]
*  This would also be a huge benefit as a capitalist running companies. I mean, how much of your time [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3959.3599999999997s)]
*  was spent running your companies, dealing with health care and the dysfunction of employees [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3964.24s)]
*  staying at companies because they couldn't? Awful. Get health care in another company. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3968.08s)]
*  What about military, Dean? What would you do? Okay, now military. And this is where, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3972.3999999999996s)]
*  to answer your question very directly once again, nobody can tell you that they can even begin to [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3976.7999999999997s)]
*  address our fiscal challenges without looking at that ridiculous number. Approaching a trillion [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3981.68s)]
*  dollars a year. And by the way, the Pentagon has not passed an audit. They would, in my [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3988.72s)]
*  administration, there would be a top-down assessment of every single program, every single base and [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=3995.2s)]
*  facility, every explanation of why we are in those 80 nations and whether or not we should be [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4000.7999999999997s)]
*  employing 21st century strategies to keep our country safe. And I think one of the simplest [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4006.7999999999997s)]
*  solutions, you guys, is we should be entrusting countries more proximate to the problems [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4012.3999999999996s)]
*  to manage them. Doesn't mean we're not a good ally anymore. It just doesn't mean that we are [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4018.7999999999997s)]
*  in a position any longer to be the policeman for the entire world when we can barely take damn care [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4023.2799999999997s)]
*  of our country itself. It's just so damn simple. And I'm frustrated by it because as someone who [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4029.3599999999997s)]
*  lost his father in a completely obnoxious and unnecessary war, a guy that I have on my phone [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4034.8799999999997s)]
*  right now, digital audio tapes that he used to send back tapes to my mom, where he says, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4040.9599999999996s)]
*  I've come to the conclusion, and he loved America. He did not like that war, but he loved America. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4046.48s)]
*  He said, I believe the only reason we're still here is because so many people are making so [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4051.52s)]
*  much money. He saw it. And the same thing is happening to this day, you guys, that trillion [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4057.52s)]
*  dollars, that's going somewhere. It's going in people's pockets. And I believe we can cut that. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4061.92s)]
*  And I'm not going to make a proposition, but I believe after a comprehensive assessment, [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4066.7200000000003s)]
*  that we can save hundreds of billions of dollars that can either be saved on the bottom line or [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4071.44s)]
*  better yet actually invested in human beings instead of the destruction of them, period. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4076.08s)]
*  Would you zero base budget? Absolutely. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4081.6s)]
*  Why do I've had to go back to Washington twice to vote on CRs, continuing resolutions. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4084.72s)]
*  It is the dysfunction is absurd. There's not a there may be five people that can read a PNL [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4091.92s)]
*  or a balance sheet and the whole damn Congress. Our budgeting system is completely broken. And [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4097.2s)]
*  yes, as president, I would demand a zero base budgeting and procedure and like I said, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4102.16s)]
*  a comprehensive independent assessment of every program. And if it is not generating return, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4110.24s)]
*  or if it could be outsourced to the private sector that can deliver it for a better value, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4116.96s)]
*  that's how we should proceed. And by the way, it may not be easy. It may take time to get done, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4121.76s)]
*  but why we don't try is absurd. And to answer your final question, if we don't, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4126.32s)]
*  and once foreign investors no longer consider the United States of America the safest place [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4131.4400000000005s)]
*  to deploy capital, it's too late. And I will not certainly under my watch will not let us get there. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4135.68s)]
*  But we've got to recraft. And lastly, can I say one more thing quick on that, Chamath? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4141.92s)]
*  The only way that I think we can address the biggest issue in the country, which is the growing [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4147.120000000001s)]
*  disparity between those who have wealth and income and those that do not, we're not a nation that [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4153.6s)]
*  will redistribute. I think we've been not just unsuccessful, we actually created some of the [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4160.08s)]
*  problems we now find ourselves in. The way to do it is to raise the foundation. The same way it was [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4164.16s)]
*  raised for me by a stroke of good luck. I was adopted by a dad who gave me everything. And who [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4169.28s)]
*  knows where I would have been if that didn't happen. I want to do the same thing for everybody. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4175.92s)]
*  Have healthcare, have great education, have childcare, make sure you have a house, a place [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4181.04s)]

*  Talk about education then briefly. So if the spectrum is the teachers union on one end of [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4193.04s)]
*  the spectrum, and Vivek Ramaswamy, who would dismantle the Department of Education at the [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4197.759999999999s)]
*  federal level and just push all the responsibility to the states with a voucher program, he talked [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4203.679999999999s)]
*  about it here once, where are you and what's your philosophy on the state of education? [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4208.24s)]
*  I would say I'm in the middle because I think there's some worthiness to both of those [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4214.08s)]
*  perspectives. What would I do? I would fundamentally reinvent American public education with the best [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4219.68s)]
*  and the brightest, with students, with teachers, with families, with the nonprofit sector and the [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4225.4400000000005s)]
*  business sector because right now business needs to participate in 21st century education to advise [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4230.4800000000005s)]
*  the teachers and the administrators and the curricula designers what skills they need. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4235.92s)]
*  They're not even part of the conversation, you guys. I don't know about you all. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4242.4s)]
*  Why do you think that there are certain places, progressive, liberal bastions, if you will, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4246.24s)]
*  that have been the first to dismantle things like STEM and AP classes? Why is that happening? [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4252.4s)]
*  I wish I had a good answer for that. It's appalling, but I do have a good solution. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4258.48s)]
*  I'm sure like you guys, you all know this, the single most important determinant of a child [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4263.2s)]
*  success educationally is the quality of their educator. Every single study says the same thing. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4268.24s)]
*  The United States of America right now, we pay about 81% of the per capita GDP to teachers for [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4273.679999999999s)]
*  compensation. The best performing systems in the world, and there is a correlation, [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4281.12s)]
*  pay 120, 130, sometimes 140, 140% of their per capita GDP. They make teaching one of the most [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4285.44s)]
*  admired, elevated professions in their nation. They identify great teachers when they're still young [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4292.32s)]
*  and I think we should be a nation that does the same thing. We're not attracting the best and [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4298.5599999999995s)]
*  brightest any longer. When Teach for America teachers outperform teachers who have tenure [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4301.92s)]
*  or been at it for 10, 20, 30 years, does that not say the quality matters? It's not the school, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4307.12s)]
*  how it looks, but anyway, I would reinvent and the other thing is this. I'm sure like you guys, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4312.08s)]
*  I remember a couple teachers that made a huge difference in my life and they're about 50, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4317.12s)]
*  I could barely remember it all. They should all be those two. And then furthermore, if you think [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4321.5199999999995s)]
*  sitting in front of a blackboard is the way to teach kids in this day and age, no, you got to [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4326.32s)]
*  get out of the school. You got to look at Scandinavian countries and Asian countries and how experiential [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4330.96s)]
*  learning, learning from the best, most extraordinary educators in the world through screens on occasion, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4335.679999999999s)]
*  but to experience. AI is going to fundamentally change employment as we know it. We have nobody [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4341.84s)]
*  in Washington that gets it. We needed an administration in 2024 that does and begins to [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4348.24s)]
*  simply rectify all of these problems, anticipating the change that's coming. This administration is [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4354.8s)]
*  not going to do it and education should be redesigned based on the change we know is coming. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4359.84s)]
*  And I don't have all the answers, but I know a lot of people out in California and around the [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4366.400000000001s)]
*  country and around the world who could help us. Is it too early to regulate AI? Or is it? No, [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4370.08s)]
*  no, I think it should be. I think it should be very, you know, Jason, I would say right now it [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4375.68s)]
*  should be very limited. And this is where back to the conversation about anonymous accounts, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4379.6s)]
*  we do have to set, I think, some standards and penalties for nefarious use of AI. If we don't do [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4386.56s)]
*  that early and set the tone, I think it will get out of control. So to me, that's all we should do [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4391.68s)]
*  right now. And let it grow, let it expand, let large enterprises and small come up with extraordinary [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4396.4800000000005s)]
*  ways to save money, by the way. AI is going to save extraordinary sums of money for the federal [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4403.280000000001s)]
*  government and health care for businesses. We can anticipate how employment will change and what [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4408.48s)]
*  jobs will be jobs of the future. But if we don't think about that now, we're going to do what [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4414.32s)]
*  Congress always does get caught off guard, have to come in on a midnight ill prepared with a [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4418.799999999999s)]
*  thousand page bill that nobody understands because it was written by a lobbyist that had skin in the [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4424.48s)]
*  game and does not serve America. And that maybe wraps up this whole conversation. Yeah, I'm just [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4428.799999999999s)]
*  not sure folks really understand in Congress what they're doing. No, it's front. Like the [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4433.92s)]
*  difference between foundational models and the utilization of those models in an endpoint [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4440.32s)]
*  are very different regimes to think about regulation. And they're not even that that [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4448.64s)]
*  framework isn't even understood. Not at all. We're not even talking about regulating outcomes [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4454.72s)]
*  or actions. We're talking about regulating the infrastructure that could cause various outcomes. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4460.16s)]
*  Regulate, regulate. I'm very much against where this is all evolved to. And I think like some [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4467.04s)]
*  folks kind of want to say, hey, this is a regulatory capture moment. But I want to see someone in [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4472.08s)]
*  Congress stand up and demonstrate an understanding first, before they can even have the right to [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4476.88s)]
*  articulate, you know, a framework for regulation. Well, Dave, I can tell you what there's one man [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4482.72s)]
*  I want to shout out this guy, Don Beyer is a former US ambassador, Democrat from Virginia. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4488.400000000001s)]
*  He must be 70. He went back to college, I think Johns Hopkins and just received or is pursuing [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4493.76s)]
*  his degree in artificial intelligence. That's the kind of representative. Isn't that cool? You would [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4499.4400000000005s)]
*  never know his name because he's not on Fox or MSNBC screaming at night. But those are the kinds [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4504.32s)]
*  of people that should be celebrated. A lot of my Republican colleagues that got thrown out of [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4509.6s)]
*  Congress because they had the audacity to support the Constitution when Trump was impeached the [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4513.68s)]
*  second time. You know, those people I celebrate. I got to run, but can I tell one quick story to [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4520.400000000001s)]
*  wrap my whole story up and advice what I want to try to do? You know, at the end of the day, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4524.320000000001s)]
*  none of this occurs, none of the successes, none of the policy ideas, none of the ideation occurs [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4530.08s)]
*  if we don't repair. And that means restoring friendships, our families, our communities and [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4535.360000000001s)]
*  our country. So I do a series back home in Minnesota called Common Ground. I get six [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4541.68s)]
*  Democrats and six Republicans invited to a table. We break bread, we introduce ourselves, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4546.240000000001s)]
*  tell a little bit of our life stories. We talk about health care policy and we talk about [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4551.04s)]
*  immigration policy, which is where everything I shared tonight comes from both Democrats and [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4555.12s)]
*  Republicans. And it's a two hour session facilitated by an extraordinary group called Braver Angels. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4559.04s)]
*  I encourage you to look them up. They are remarkable doing this work all around the country. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4565.4400000000005s)]
*  And at the end of these sessions, we go around the table and each person at the table shares [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4570.16s)]
*  a little bit about what they got out of this experience. And I had an episode not long ago [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4574.64s)]
*  that sums up my whole mission. A young woman, Emily, looks across the table at Dave and says, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4579.44s)]
*  Dave, when you drove up in your F-150 with the Trump sticker on it, I almost got back in my car, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4584.72s)]
*  left the parking lot and drove away. I could not bear to go in the building, let alone sit at a [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4590.32s)]
*  table with you. And she said, but I got to say, I so loved sitting here and you're a good guy. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4594.8s)]
*  And I learned something. Goes around the table, comes to Dave and he looks at Emily and says, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4601.28s)]
*  Emily, when you drove up in your Prius, I wanted to run it over. And he says, but hey, I got to [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4606.64s)]
*  tell you, Emily, I've never met a progressive as cool as you. And I really am glad I came to this [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4613.92s)]
*  today. And at that moment, Emily and Dave stood up in front of our table and they embraced. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4619.12s)]
*  And to see a bleeding heart liberal and a dyed in the wool Trump-er do that probably was the most [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4625.36s)]
*  important moment in my entire career in service. If that is the only moment of its kind in my career [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4632.48s)]
*  in service, it would have made it worthwhile. And that is exactly what I'm going to inspire [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4639.92s)]
*  President of the United States, get Emily and Dave to hug it out. All they have to do is be invited [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4645.2s)]
*  for a little dinner, give them some space in place to recognize their common cause and their [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4651.6s)]
*  common ground. And that's how we're going to do this. I don't see a candidate right now in the [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4655.68s)]
*  ballot that has that intention, has that capacity or has that capability. So I just want to thank [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4659.92s)]
*  you guys. And last thing, and just, just yes or no, can everybody expect that you will be on the [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4666.0s)]
*  ballot in every state? I can't say I'm going to be in the ballot in every state, Jamath, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4671.2s)]
*  because I don't think it's possible between time and money. I'm going to have to make some choices [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4675.36s)]
*  and that's just the sickening truth. I will, I want to salute Bernie Sanders. He actually made [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4680.16s)]
*  it possible for a candidate like me and probably future candidates who are subject to this nauseating [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4685.12s)]
*  system to actually still compete and get to the convention and maybe win because he depowered [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4690.4s)]
*  people like me, members of Congress that used to have outsized votes, disproportionately so, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4697.5199999999995s)]
*  versus voters. And I celebrate him because he was right. I used to think he was a sore loser. Bernie [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4704.24s)]
*  Sanders was absolutely right about a rigged system that is keeping people out of the process, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4709.759999999999s)]
*  keeping candidates out of the process and keeping debate out of the process. So I'm going to be in [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4715.44s)]
*  the most, I'm going to be on most ballots. I've got to raise money and frankly, I hate to be [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4719.759999999999s)]
*  shameless, but the truth is if we want to get on ballots, I need support and it's easy. Dean24.com, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4724.16s)]
*  you know, I, by the way, I'm at 15% in New Hampshire after just two weeks. We thought it would [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4731.2s)]
*  take six if we were lucky. Wow. So people can throw 15 bucks our way to get on ballots at [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4735.84s)]
*  Dean24.com. And by the way, Joe Biden, 27%. 73% of New Hampshire Democratic voters do not want [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4741.04s)]
*  the sitting president of the United States as their nominee. And mark my words, we're going [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4750.64s)]
*  to bring change. Thank you guys. All right. Thank you so much. Thanks for the time. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4756.32s)]
*  Thank you very much. Keep the faith guys. I mean it. Love to see you again. See you later. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4761.04s)]
*  Yeah. Great. Thank you. 90 minutes with Dean Phillips. Everybody go to Dean24.com if you [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4764.24s)]
*  want to learn more. All right, besties. I think that was another epic discussion with the presidential [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4768.5599999999995s)]
*  candidate. What's your thoughts? Chamath, you set up this interview. Where does he stand in your [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4775.2s)]
*  likely votes for president in 2024? Where would you rank him now? Andrew Yang texted me [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4782.96s)]
*  like last week and said, would you guys do this? And I was really interested because mostly I [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4790.639999999999s)]
*  didn't know where he was coming from, to be totally honest. But I think his national visibility is [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4796.08s)]
*  probably going to increase a lot. My reaction is that he is who he says he is, which is like [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4802.24s)]
*  kind of down the middle. He doesn't take either extreme and he kind of takes a moderate point of [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4808.5599999999995s)]
*  view and says there's a balance of this and that that can work. And that's actually good that he [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4814.24s)]
*  owns that as opposed to it being sort of a consequence or a byproduct of not getting what [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4819.28s)]
*  he wants. He kind of like that is where he starts. So I like that about him a lot. I thought he was [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4823.599999999999s)]
*  really candid about what doesn't work. I really appreciate that honesty. He's saying some of the [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4828.8s)]
*  right things around capping Medicare, zero-based budgeting, the military. I think all of those [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4836.0s)]
*  things are right. I didn't like, to be honest, the free speech part. I thought that that was, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4844.400000000001s)]
*  I don't think you can have some kind of registry of verified accounts or something. I just think [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4850.24s)]
*  that's a non-starter for America. It's a super slippery slope. But in general, I was really [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4854.32s)]
*  impressed. And his war stories as a businessman were pretty cool. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4860.88s)]
*  Aaron Norris Pretty awesome. Sax, what's your candid thoughts? I mean, obviously he's not part [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4866.48s)]
*  of your political party, but what do you think his chances are versus Biden? And how would you [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4871.28s)]
*  assess his performance here today? Sax Well, I was pleasantly surprised that [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4876.4s)]
*  he made the case for himself not just based on Biden's age and the fact that he's 54, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4881.76s)]
*  but he also, I think, took a number of interesting policy stances that were a little [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4888.4s)]
*  different than where Biden is. He did it on foreign policy, did it on domestic policy. So [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4892.96s)]
*  I think he took a number of positions that were refreshing. And a big one, I think, relates to [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4897.679999999999s)]
*  his personal story where he talks about how he lost his father in Vietnam and that that war was [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4905.12s)]
*  kept going much longer than it should have been because basically the greed of the military-industrial [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4910.24s)]
*  complex. And he didn't fully connect the dots all the way to our present situation in Ukraine, but [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4914.719999999999s)]
*  at least I think he would be skeptical of the influence of the MIC in our politics. What he [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4921.5199999999995s)]
*  said with respect to Ukraine is, well, he said that it would be shameful to abandon them now, [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4927.36s)]
*  but he also said that if it's true, he wasn't willing to concede it because he just doesn't [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4931.36s)]
*  know factually. But if it's true that we could have avoided the war by taking NATO expansion off [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4934.8s)]
*  the table, then it would only be common sense to do that. I think that when the histories of this [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4940.88s)]
*  are written, it's going to be abundantly clear that we could have done precisely that. So his [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4945.68s)]
*  difference of opinion with me isn't in the logic, it's just in what facts he knows to be true. So I [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4950.24s)]
*  actually thought that his position there was reasonable. If it came down to a choice between [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4958.88s)]
*  Dean Phillips as the Democratic nominee and someone like Nikki Haley as a Republican nominee, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4968.64s)]
*  I'd vote for Dean Phillips all day long. One other thing I like about him is he is a business owner [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4973.2s)]
*  and he presents as a Bill Clinton Democrat. I think that it's not an accident he's got a picture [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4980.24s)]
*  of Bill Clinton on the wall behind him. He presents as a- [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4985.92s)]
*  That was exactly my takeaway too. I thought, wow, this is the- [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4988.8s)]
*  Yeah, he presents as a moderate Democrat who's a little bit of a throwback to the Democratic [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4990.96s)]
*  Party of the 1990s. If RFK Jr. is trying to bring back the Democratic Party of say the 1960s, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=4994.639999999999s)]
*  the party of John F. Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy, his father, I think that Dean Phillips is more [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5001.679999999999s)]
*  trying to bring back the Democratic Party of the 1990s. Both of them I think are ultimately very [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5007.28s)]
*  out of step with where the Democratic Party is today, but they're out of step with it in ways [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5011.84s)]
*  that I like. So he is a candidate who I could support against a Republican who if we ended up [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5016.400000000001s)]
*  getting a sort of stale neocon type Republican candidate, I would take a Dean Phillips all day [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5022.8s)]
*  long. Really? Wow, great. Freeberg, your thoughts? I mean, I think if Joe Biden runs, he obviously [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5026.96s)]
*  doesn't stand a chance just based on the structural issues that he described. If Joe Biden [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5036.72s)]
*  doesn't run and drops out, I think there are probably a lot of other Democratic candidates [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5042.320000000001s)]
*  who are going to have deeper pockets and more support from the party and more celebrity or [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5046.16s)]
*  what have you to get themselves elected. With respect to his candidacy and whether it's a [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5053.76s)]
*  realistic kind of campaign, I would probably argue no. But what I really like is the fact that he is [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5058.08s)]
*  making the case, I think in a stronger way than even RFK Jr. was on how these incumbents and how [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5064.719999999999s)]
*  the incumbency in the party system prevents new candidates from actually participating in a true [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5072.32s)]
*  democratic process. And it feels to me a lot like what goes on in that sense is the equivalent of [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5078.24s)]
*  regulatory capture, but in politics. It allows these party leaders and influencers, which is [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5084.08s)]
*  a very small group of people, to decide who gets to go on a ballot in a state, to decide who gets [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5091.84s)]
*  to be the nominee who decides who gets to run for president. The best thing that he's doing is [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5097.2s)]
*  exposing a system that Bernie Sanders calls rigged. And that clearly, I think, is very [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5101.04s)]
*  inequitable and doesn't create a true kind of democratic process. So it's really great to see [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5106.88s)]
*  him doing this work and telling the story. And I'm glad we gave him the forum to do that for just [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5111.52s)]
*  that reason. And if you were to have a choice of him or Biden, you'd pick him? Yeah. If you had a [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5116.24s)]
*  choice of him or Vivek on the other side, who'd you pick? No comment. No comment. Okay. Taking [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5123.36s)]
*  off my moderator hat for a minute. Loved his business story, so I grew through Chamath. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5129.2s)]
*  Really excited to see somebody under the age of 80 run for president. And I thought there were [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5132.719999999999s)]
*  really two powerful moments there when he said he would send special forces in and then he was [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5138.32s)]
*  pretty aggressive in his assessment of Netanyahu's leadership. And overall, he did engage with every [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5143.04s)]
*  single issue and had interesting policy issues. No, Chamath? It seemed pretty engaging there. So [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5149.5199999999995s)]
*  overall, great job, everybody. I think four for four on the presidential candidates. And just as [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5155.68s)]
*  a programming note, we have sent the first podcasting kits, the first microphones to four [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5159.68s)]
*  presidential candidates, for those of you counting at home. What do you think will happen post this, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5164.64s)]
*  Chamath? Vivek got a big bump, RFK got a big bump. What do you think is going to happen post this? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5170.16s)]
*  I think that Dean Phillips is going to poll really well. The more that people get to see him, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5175.04s)]
*  and I think New Hampshire is set up well for grassroots politics like this, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5179.36s)]
*  it will go over very well. The question I think Freeberg [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5184.32s)]
*  points is the key one, which is the party infrastructure has tremendous antibodies. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5188.88s)]
*  And if they decide to shut you out, which they did very strongly and [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5196.24s)]
*  vocally for RFK, you don't have much of a choice except to run as an independent. So [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5203.92s)]
*  his candidacy is precarious, not because of the viability of him as a candidate, actually, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5209.44s)]
*  because I think it's quite high or his likeability, which is quite high or his electability, as Sac [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5214.16s)]
*  said, which against the right person is very high. This has all to do with the antibodies of the [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5218.48s)]
*  infrastructure. Just a quick programming note, J Cal, are you drinking a chocolate milk? [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5224.08s)]
*  I'm drinking a Core Power 26. 26 grams of protein. I'm still on my [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5230.4s)]
*  trying to get more protein, but I did have a Super Gut Bar earlier today, which was quite nice. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5236.0s)]
*  Thought that was a chocolate milk. This one's got 26 grams. It's a 42 gram protein. Yeah, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5241.6s)]
*  I don't want to give a free add to Core Power, but Sacs, in addition to the antibodies that [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5245.5199999999995s)]
*  kicked RFK out of the Democratic Party, the press also blocked him. CNN, et cetera, wouldn't let [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5250.0s)]
*  him on. The right would let him on all day long. Does this same antibody kind of system exist on [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5255.12s)]
*  the right at all, or is the right more open to multiple candidates, just generally speaking? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5262.24s)]
*  No, I mean, you look at Republican debates and they are vigorous debates. There is real [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5265.84s)]
*  disagreement on the right. There are real debates on the right and there is a real working out of [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5271.04s)]
*  contested issues. The Democratic Party, by and large, is a machine. It works in lockstep. That's [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5277.12s)]
*  why what Dean Phillips is doing is so sacrilegious. I mean, he is pretty much ending his career [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5282.8s)]
*  as someone who can just move up through the ranks of the Democratic Party. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5290.48s)]
*  Maybe this will turn out in a way where it gives him like a leapfrog, but I don't think so. I mean, [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5295.12s)]
*  I think he's basically signaling to the higher-ups in the Democratic Party that he's no longer [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5299.76s)]
*  a candidate for advancement through the regular course. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5305.6s)]
*  Got it. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5309.84s)]
*  One analogy is that the Democratic Party is like the empire and the Republicans are like the rebel [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5310.96s)]
*  alliance. The Republican Party is a bunch of misfits. It's a bunch of discontents. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5316.96s)]
*  Ewoks. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5323.5199999999995s)]
*  Ewoks. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5323.84s)]
*  And solos. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5324.32s)]
*  And solos or whatever, but the Democratic Party marches in lockstep. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5326.32s)]
*  Is that why the Democratic Party wins more, is because they're in lockstep? [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5330.72s)]
*  Yeah. They're much better fundraisers. They're more disciplined. They have their act together [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5333.92s)]
*  right now. I don't think this was always the case, but I think it's true right now. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5339.12s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. Well, we had a couple of other issues we wanted to get to, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5342.96s)]
*  so I think we can wrap there. Great job, everybody. That was spectacular. Great job [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5346.88s)]
*  getting the candidate, Chema. Thank you for that. All right. We have to touch on what happened [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5350.88s)]
*  this week with the US and China relations. Everybody knows Xi Jinping was here in the [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5354.88s)]
*  Bay Area to meet with Biden, yelling, welcome Xi at the plane. Maybe she's selling some treasuries. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5358.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5365.52s)]
*  That's what the press said. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5366.0s)]
*  I mean, we're like some sort of piss poor company that's selling us junk bonds. I mean, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5368.72s)]
*  the second that Xi gets off the plane, she's hawking our shitty bonds. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5373.92s)]
*  Wow, listen, everybody's raising a fund right now. Fund raising's hard. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5378.64s)]
*  Did you guys hear the commentary that the treasury auction had a really tough moment [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5381.92s)]
*  last week? They had a big auction on what was it 10 and 30 year bonds, the 30 year bond bid was [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5386.8s)]
*  not really there. And so they're they got to get buyers in the market. They got to go get the Chinese. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5391.4400000000005s)]
*  She's coming to raise money apparently too. She's here. Everybody's having a hard time raising right [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5395.76s)]
*  now. Pretty crazy. But Chema, you and I tweeted about this clip where Xi Jinping said that, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5400.24s)]
*  you know, he's basically for peace and that we have to work together. Let me just start there [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5407.12s)]
*  with you, Chema, so we can get through this quickly. Do you take him at his word? There [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5410.8s)]
*  were cynical people saying like, hey, you know, he's just desperate needs more trade needs more [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5415.84s)]
*  business. How do you interpret Xi's peace pipe here? You know, and his dinner with a bunch of [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5420.24s)]
*  executives last night? I think he's pragmatic. He's somebody that wants to not just rule over [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5427.28s)]
*  China, but he wants to do it for the rest of his life. And he wants to do a good job. And [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5434.400000000001s)]
*  I've said this many times, China's issues are endemic and pervasive, and they're demographic. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5440.0s)]
*  And so he has huge structural issues that he has to fix in the Chinese economy. And so I think all [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5446.4800000000005s)]
*  of this is just about him focusing on his priorities, which makes sense, which is really [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5453.04s)]
*  about domestic policy. There's an enormous real estate issue that has to get sorted out. There is [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5457.6s)]
*  a GDP issue that has to get sorted out. There's a youth unemployment issue that has to get sorted out. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5462.4800000000005s)]
*  And then there's an aging and a birth rate and replacement issue that has to get sorted out. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5468.96s)]
*  All of these things are enormous efforts. And so I think he's pragmatic enough to not [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5474.0s)]
*  also then add foreign misadventures to that plate. And I think what you heard was him being very clear [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5482.0s)]
*  about just exactly that. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5489.44s)]
*  Sacks, what was your interpretation? There's so many jumping off points here. You got [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5491.599999999999s)]
*  foreign policy, you got TikTok, fentanyl. I mean, there's a long list of issues, but [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5495.28s)]
*  does it feel like we're turning a corner on relations? Hey, they need us, we need them. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5500.08s)]
*  What was your interpretation on all this? [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5504.4s)]
*  Well, I think what's going on here is that the administration has its hands full with two wars. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5506.48s)]
*  They've still got this war in Europe over Ukraine, which is going very badly. And now we have a new [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5511.04s)]
*  war in the Middle East that caught them completely by surprise. Recall that literally a week or two [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5516.16s)]
*  before October 7th, you had Jake Sullivan saying the Middle East has never been more peaceful. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5521.76s)]
*  So they absolutely did not anticipate what was coming. And now we have half of our [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5526.320000000001s)]
*  carrier groups in the Middle East positioned there in case it blows up into a wider regional war. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5530.400000000001s)]
*  So I think the simple fact of the matter is that the Biden administration, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5536.320000000001s)]
*  this is more than they can handle. Or let's put it this way. They're trying to put the China compete [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5540.64s)]
*  on hold. They're trying to put it on ice while they figure out a way to rescue this losing effort [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5545.360000000001s)]
*  in Ukraine and to prevent the situation in the Middle East from spiraling out of control. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5552.0s)]
*  It's just too much for them. They don't have the bandwidth to deal with a war or conflict breaking [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5556.08s)]
*  out in the Asia Pacific. So I think that's the Biden administration's motivation here is they're [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5561.76s)]
*  seeking to ease tensions because they're just too bandwidth constrained to deal with it. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5568.08s)]
*  By the same token, I think Chamath is right that she realizes that he's got his hands full [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5572.96s)]
*  with domestic economic problems. He doesn't need a ratcheting up of tensions with the United States [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5579.36s)]
*  right now. And I would also add that on foreign policy, I think what you're seeing in his remarks [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5585.2s)]
*  is a return to the far away from this kind of wolf warrior diplomacy that they had going on a few [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5592.08s)]
*  years ago, where they were kind of saying these very bellicose things, and they're kind of flexing [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5599.2s)]
*  their muscles in the Asia Pacific region that really backfired on them because it raised the [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5603.28s)]
*  hackles of all those other Asian countries, and it was making it too easy for the United States [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5608.72s)]
*  to form a containment alliance against China. So he's moving away from that type of wolf warrior [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5613.52s)]
*  rhetoric that got them nowhere. And he's moved back to the rhetoric of a Deng Xiaoping, who said [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5618.88s)]
*  that China's policy should be to bide its time and hide its light under a bushel. In other words, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5623.92s)]
*  just get stronger and stronger. Don't let people get wise to how strong you are. And then when the [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5631.280000000001s)]
*  time is right, you will flex your muscles, but just keep getting stronger. And I think he's [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5637.28s)]
*  returned to that policy. And you saw this with the Belt and Road Conference, that in Beijing just a [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5643.44s)]
*  few weeks ago, where you saw countries like Vietnam participating. And I think that China, [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5649.2s)]
*  their strategy is now to try to use some honey to catch some flies as opposed to using this kind [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5656.08s)]
*  of bellicose rhetoric. And saber rattling. And if we look at this chart, I think this chart speaks [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5662.5599999999995s)]
*  volumes, Friedberg, in foreign investment into China has absolutely fallen off a cliff. In the [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5666.96s)]
*  decoupling, the saber rattling, and other countries looking to have resiliency and not be dependent [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5674.4800000000005s)]
*  on China has obviously blown up in his lap. What are your thoughts on foreign trade and our business [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5682.08s)]
*  relationship with China and their relationship with the West and the rest of the world? [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5687.68s)]
*  This used to be a thing to do to make money. And then it became a question mark of whether you can [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5692.32s)]
*  make money. A couple years ago, and now as of this year, I would argue, you're a pariah. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5698.96s)]
*  If you were trying to invest in China or do any business in China, it's almost like you can't do [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5707.36s)]
*  business with the enemy. That's the tone shift that I think accelerated in the last 24 months. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5712.16s)]
*  And as that tone shift happened in the business community and the investment community, [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5718.64s)]
*  it obviously escalated the tenor of what is the broader relationship look like that I think [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5723.92s)]
*  catalyzed, hey, we got to simmer things down because we can't really afford or deal with [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5733.12s)]
*  that escalation right now. But I don't know, I mentioned this to you guys, I was at a conference [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5737.68s)]
*  this past summer, the summer of 22, it was like, hey, maybe, you know, when are things going to get [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5742.5599999999995s)]
*  bad with China? To this summer, it's like if you were doing business in China, you're trying to [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5747.2s)]
*  pick up pennies in front of a freight train, like you're going to get run over. And it happened in [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5753.2s)]
*  one year. That was my observation. It was like this. And I could tell from the tone of what [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5758.72s)]
*  everyone is saying on stage, it was like universal. There wasn't anyone that disagreed. And similarly, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5764.48s)]
*  as you guys know, we've heard this from both political parties in the US, it suddenly became [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5770.5599999999995s)]
*  the new new thing for Democrats and Republicans to denounce China denounce investing in China [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5774.64s)]
*  denounce doing business with China. But too much too fast, I would argue, has led to an observation [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5779.68s)]
*  of the consequences to deeply coupled economic partner to the United States. China is the largest [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5786.8s)]
*  buyer of US agricultural exports, $200 billion a year of farm products that we make get shipped [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5793.84s)]
*  out to China. China is a major supplier to our electronics industry. We don't need to recount [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5800.08s)]
*  all the relationships, but trying to decouple too quickly trying to call China the enemy too fast, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5805.12s)]
*  I think has led to a realization that that's not really a tenable. So I would argue that maybe this [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5811.12s)]
*  week has been a moment. I don't know if it really changes the long term trajectory, but it seems [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5816.08s)]
*  like it's certainly a very important and critical pause in the escalation. One thing I wanted to [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5820.4s)]
*  comment, I think one of the biggest winners this week, I'd love your point of view on this guys, [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5827.2s)]
*  is like Gavin Newsom. I mean, he was all over this week. Like he was at the plane greeting G, [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5830.48s)]
*  he cleaned up San Francisco. I mean, he was out from the president. He was at the dinner. I mean, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5836.16s)]
*  do you guys think like Gavin is, you know, gonna be there when Joe says, I'll see you later, I'm [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5842.8s)]
*  not gonna run again. And then when I spoke, yeah, what's happening here, it's all just a big [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5848.4s)]
*  coincidence. He actually went on stage in San Francisco, made all those comments about the [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5853.84s)]
*  city should be cleaned up and we haven't been doing it. We could have the whole time. He's [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5859.84s)]
*  very honest about it. Well, it's not quite what he said. Yeah. But I look, I mean, I don't know. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5863.2s)]
*  What do you guys think? He's quasi owning it, right, Zach? Quasi owning it? No, I don't think he did [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5866.56s)]
*  own it. He gave these really weird remarks about how there are some people who are saying that [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5869.84s)]
*  we're only cleaning up San Francisco because there's these fancy people here. That was just [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5874.88s)]
*  such a weird term as well. It's true because it's true. And it's true, but true. Yeah, it was [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5879.360000000001s)]
*  like he was headed in one direction and then realized he was making a mistake but couldn't [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5883.76s)]
*  quite figure out what to do about it. Let's pull it up. Let's pull it up. It's good. Yeah, here. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5887.04s)]
*  Play it. They're just cleaning up this place because all those fancy leaders are coming into town. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5890.64s)]
*  That's true because it's true. What he's basically doing there is admitting that he, as the governor, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5896.16s)]
*  has the power to snap his fingers and wave his magic wand and clean up the streets of San Francisco. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5905.92s)]
*  And that is completely different than what he's been telling us for years. For years, [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5911.12s)]
*  he's been maintaining that the problem of homelessness in California is owned by local [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5914.72s)]
*  officials or by judges or somehow by the system itself and is too complex and is beyond his power [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5919.2s)]
*  to simply do something about it. But he just admitted that, in fact, he does have the power [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5925.12s)]
*  to do something about it. In fact, he is the boss of a one-party state. And all he had to do was [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5930.48s)]
*  snap his fingers and make this homeless problem go away. And he's willing to do that for Xi Jinping. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5936.56s)]
*  He's willing to do that for Dreamforce. He's willing to do that for the Super Bowl. But he [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5942.400000000001s)]
*  is not willing to do that for the ordinary citizens of San Francisco. And I think that [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5946.8s)]
*  ultimately is going to be a huge vulnerability. What he should have said here is it's true that [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5951.84s)]
*  we cleaned up the city to represent ourselves well for these foreign leaders who are coming in. But [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5957.280000000001s)]
*  the truth of it is that we should be doing this every day. And here's my agenda for fixing it, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5964.32s)]
*  point one, two, three. And if we could get everyone on board with this agenda, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5969.5199999999995s)]
*  we could fix this problem. But that's not what he said. What he basically communicated was [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5972.96s)]
*  that I can solve this problem anytime, but I don't give a shit about you, ordinary citizens. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5978.16s)]
*  We only do this for the fancy people. Trimoth, any reaction to that? [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5983.04s)]
*  Yeah. He's auditioning. I mean, I think that much is clear. Again, I would just say it's, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5987.92s)]
*  you can't just go to China and meet with Xi Jinping. So that has to be endorsed. It's [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5993.36s)]
*  negotiated. It's enabled. You go there with talking points. You go there in discussion with state and [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=5998.639999999999s)]
*  treasury and the rest of the federal bureaucracy behind you. So that was a clear audition of some [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6005.599999999999s)]
*  kind. And I think it was obvious that they wanted the APEC summit to be the backdrop of a Biden, [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6011.839999999999s)]
*  Xi meeting. And so you're doubling down on California. So I think it's kind of like a dry [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6022.72s)]
*  run here is what I would say. I mean, I'm not sure that it's, I don't know what for. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6031.6s)]
*  It definitely made him look presidential. And I think you're right that when he went to China a [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6035.84s)]
*  few weeks ago to invite Xi to the summit, that was clearly sanctioned by, it got to be by Blinken, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6039.2s)]
*  by Sullivan, by the National Security establishment. Of course, of course. But again, the reason why [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6045.360000000001s)]
*  they sanctioned that is because they really want to ease tensions with China right now, given [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6050.64s)]
*  how full their hands are with the Middle East right now and with Ukraine. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6056.160000000001s)]
*  No, no, no. I'm not debating that. I think that that makes all the sense in the world. I think [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6059.52s)]
*  that you could have sent any number of, well, not any number, but one of three cabinet secretaries, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6063.52s)]
*  and it would have been just as appropriate. I think sending the governor, I think was a little [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6068.240000000001s)]
*  bit of a, it was a test. Can he perform? And I think he did a good job there. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6072.8s)]
*  He helped himself. I mean, he heard himself with, it's true, because it's true, but he helped himself [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6077.12s)]
*  in terms of the optics of a during presidential. Can I say it though? I think he did look [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6081.68s)]
*  presidential in China. And I actually, that was the first time where I thought Gavin was really [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6086.8s)]
*  being a normal person, because he actually told the truth. He's like, yeah, this state is at its [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6091.36s)]
*  best. No, but this state at its best is a center of innovation in the future. And at its worst, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6098.56s)]
*  it's where every bad progressive idea goes to die. The way he said that. No, no, no, I'm saying [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6103.76s)]
*  that I'm saying San Francisco embodies both of those two things on one day. It's full of people [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6109.84s)]
*  on crystal meth and fentanyl on the second day. It's the open AI Dev did within a block of each [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6115.52s)]
*  other. So I think, and I think he just admitted, but imagine if he said something like that, [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6123.12s)]
*  that would make him so much more real. Well, maybe he's trying to find his voice. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6128.08s)]
*  I think his tone has shifted a bit. I don't know. That's what I'm saying. It felt like in seeing [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6132.88s)]
*  some of the talks he gave this week and his positioning and where he was sitting, it was, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6136.160000000001s)]
*  he looks like very legit. I definitely, I definitely will say that the Gavin Newsom of three [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6140.88s)]
*  years ago was a little bit smarmy and more of like a political insider. The Gavin Newsom of like the [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6146.080000000001s)]
*  last week, and particularly even just that comment to me, David was actually being honest. And I think [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6155.52s)]
*  that that's a more viable path if they decide to give him the candidacy, which I think is a really [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6161.6s)]
*  good observation because he could just come out and say, listen, we tried a bunch of things. We [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6169.68s)]
*  had good intent. It didn't work. And now we're reversing them. But, you know, Biden did say [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6174.0s)]
*  that he would possibly be running for his job. I want to thank Governor Newsom, want to thank him. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6179.92s)]
*  He's been one hell of a governor, man. Matter of fact, he could be anything he wants. He could [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6186.400000000001s)]
*  have the job I'm looking for. That was, I don't know if you guys heard that quote from Biden. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6191.36s)]
*  Biden said that last night. So I guess conspiracy, let's put our tinfoil tinfoil hack corner time. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6196.08s)]
*  Sacks your favorite percentage chance. Biden runs or drops out whichever way you want to do it. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6203.04s)]
*  Anybody have some tea leaves here? I still think there's about a 70% chance that Biden runs. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6209.2s)]
*  Okay, so 30% chance he doesn't. He's not going to voluntarily retire. The party apparatus, whoever's [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6216.0s)]
*  behind the scenes pulling the strings, the Wizard of Oz is going to have to go, the party elder, [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6224.5599999999995s)]
*  we have to go to him at a certain point and say, sorry, this is just not going to work. And we're [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6228.799999999999s)]
*  not there yet. Okay. Chamath, what do you think? I'm curious. I think David's right. The leaders [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6232.96s)]
*  and the powers that be will not make that call right now. I don't think it's time yet. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6237.679999999999s)]
*  Freiburg, you got to take? I don't know. I think it's speculation. I really don't know. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6241.84s)]
*  Okay. Hey, Chamath, one question here just on markets, hundreds of billions of dollars not [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6247.52s)]
*  being invested in China on that chart for investments. Where does that money go? Any [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6252.64s)]
*  thoughts on where that's going? It's just sitting in accounts. You think it's being invested in other [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6257.68s)]
*  geographies? We talked about it last week with Jared Kushner. But if you look at just the [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6261.360000000001s)]
*  ton of cash and cash equivalents, I think it just speaks to how everybody's just a little bit on the [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6268.24s)]
*  sidelines, waiting to go waiting for the green light, which, you know, you saw CPI this week, [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6272.879999999999s)]
*  by the way, I mean, we talked about it last week, which is that it looked like CPI is turning over. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6278.16s)]
*  And now the consensus forecast is you're going to see CPI with a low 2% handle by February or March [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6282.719999999999s)]
*  of this year. So you're going to see 2.2% CPI or something. Watch out. Watch out as in, hey, [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6288.96s)]
*  markets could come roaring back. Maybe not Zerp environment, but could get interesting. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6295.2s)]
*  All right, listen, we don't want to leave without doing a science corner. Everybody loves science [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6299.92s)]
*  corner. I know DeepMind has been working on many projects, Freeberg and DeepMind, of course, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6305.679999999999s)]
*  is Google's AI arm. They did go, they did protein folding. And of course, they're doing BARD, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6310.72s)]
*  but they announced something this week about predicting weather. Tell us about this paper [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6318.5599999999995s)]
*  that was released Freeberg. Yeah, so I think this was pretty exciting. You guys know, I used to work [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6323.84s)]
*  in weather when I ran climate core, we did a lot of work with weather forecasting and weather [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6328.16s)]
*  modeling. So DeepMind published a paper in the journal science this week, introducing graphcast, [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6333.28s)]
*  which is actually a publicly available model that does weather forecasting using machine [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6340.24s)]
*  learn models. It's a 37 million parameter model, just to give you a sense how small that is, [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6346.08s)]
*  that model compared to chat GPT, which is like a 1.5 trillion parameters in the chat GPT model. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6351.04s)]
*  This is only 37 million parameters in this model. And the performance that they got out of graphcast, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6359.28s)]
*  which they published in the journals, they've made the model available. You can check it out. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6365.04s)]
*  You can read the paper on how they built the model. They're very open about that. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6368.96s)]
*  When the model actually forecasts weather over a 10 day period, better than traditional weather [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6372.8s)]
*  forecasting. So let me just talk about how weather forecasting is normally done, [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6378.24s)]
*  and what they did differently and why this is such a big breakthrough. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6381.84s)]
*  So weather forecasting is usually done by kind of chopping up the atmosphere into little cubes, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6385.12s)]
*  little blocks. And you know, the weather is a fluid, it's like a liquid, you know, it's air [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6389.84s)]
*  and moisture being moved around with energy. And so normal weather forecasting systems are what are [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6395.92s)]
*  called numerical models. You run physics, you run the formulas for physics on each of those little [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6400.96s)]
*  cells of the atmosphere and figure out how they affect the cell next to them and the cell next to [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6407.6s)]
*  them. And you run that cycle forward, and you run all these calculations, and then you figure out [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6411.280000000001s)]
*  how those cells are going to be different in hours and then in days going forward. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6416.08s)]
*  And these numerical models, basically, because they're compute intensive, they're running actual [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6421.4400000000005s)]
*  calculations from physics, to model all this stuff, they require a lot of compute power. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6426.64s)]
*  There are hundreds of variables that are measured and that are output [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6433.52s)]
*  from forecasting models. And they're generally run on these very expensive [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6436.72s)]
*  compute clusters. There are two major weather forecasting systems, one is run by ECMWF, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6441.120000000001s)]
*  which is the European Weather Center. And the other one is run by NOAA called GFS here in the US. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6448.8s)]
*  And ECMWF runs on a million cores across 7700 compute cluster nodes. They spent about $200 [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6453.360000000001s)]
*  million on this compute cluster. And the GFS model runs on a 29 petaflop system, so 29 quadrillion [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6460.96s)]
*  floating operations per second, it costs $270 million. And when they run the forecast model [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6469.68s)]
*  using this traditional way of doing things, they're running all these physics calculations on these [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6475.52s)]
*  little small blocks of the atmosphere and perturbing it, fast forward, try and capture as much data out [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6479.36s)]
*  of the model runs as they can. And every six hours, they run the model. And there's a new output every [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6485.6s)]
*  six hours. And it costs a billion dollars for NOAA to run forecasts every year and disseminate [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6490.72s)]
*  that information. And then all the weather companies you know from Weather Channel and [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6496.16s)]
*  AccuWeather, they're all buying or getting free access to these forecasts that come from these big [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6499.6s)]
*  compute clusters. And that's how all weather forecasting is done. They're actually done [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6504.64s)]
*  primarily by these big centralized government super compute clusters. And then they're made [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6508.240000000001s)]
*  available for everyone to consume. And the more data and the more compute you get, the better the [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6512.8s)]
*  forecasts, the higher the resolution, meaning the more local space you can forecast on the smaller [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6519.84s)]
*  the time scales, meaning you can go from one day forecast to one hour forecast, break it down, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6525.04s)]
*  and the further out you can be accurate, whether it's five days and then 10 days and so on. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6529.4400000000005s)]
*  So more compute has been the name of the game for many, many years. In weather forecasting, [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6533.12s)]
*  the more compute you get, the better the forecasts. So this breakthrough that DeepMind has had is they [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6537.360000000001s)]
*  basically took all the past weather forecast and they built a model that figured out how to take [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6543.28s)]
*  the current weather and the weather from six hours ago, just the data. So the data feeds from [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6548.08s)]
*  today's current weather, weather six hours ago, and trained a model that predicted weather for [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6554.08s)]
*  the next 10 days. The same output as you would get from these big expensive numerical models. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6558.64s)]
*  And they did this using what's called a graph neural network. That's the architecture for the model. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6564.08s)]
*  A graph neural network is far more complicated than say, predicting an image, which is two [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6569.92s)]
*  dimensional, it's pixels next to each other, or predicting a text stream, which is one dimensional, [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6574.64s)]
*  it's what's the next word in a sentence. So these are a graph neural network. It's a fairly [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6580.240000000001s)]
*  complicated model. And so they describe all the techniques they use and everything they built in [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6584.72s)]
*  the paper. They were really open about it all. And then they were able to train this model using past [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6589.92s)]
*  forecasting data going back to the seventies. And then they ran the model. If you pull up these [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6594.4800000000005s)]
*  charts, so the first chart that we're going to pull up here, basically shows the model's [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6599.36s)]
*  performance graph cast against the big ECM, ECMWF model. And what you'll see is that the model across [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6604.799999999999s)]
*  all time scales going out to 10 days is better. And there's a bunch of ways to measure this, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6611.2s)]
*  primarily what's called root mean square error, which measures the skill of the forecast. So here [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6615.759999999999s)]
*  you can see the black line is the numerical model run by ECMWF, which is the big weather forecast [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6621.5199999999995s)]
*  model that most people in the world rely on every day. And the bottom is the machine learn model. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6628.4s)]
*  And by the way, the entire graph cast model runs in one minute. So you basically input current weather [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6634.48s)]
*  data and you input weather data from six hours ago. And in a minute you get all the forecasts. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6641.92s)]
*  Whereas currently we could run on what, like a smartphone or a laptop. It's not that small, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6647.36s)]
*  but yeah, I mean, you could run it on a small compute and you could get the results in a minute. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6653.759999999999s)]
*  And so basically everyone can now be a weather forecaster. What used to be- [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6658.5599999999995s)]
*  Is this, is the gap between the black and the blue line significant? Is that an important- [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6662.4s)]
*  It is significant in two ways. One is first of all, it's better, which is amazing because [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6667.44s)]
*  researchers have spent billions of dollars and decades trying to make their numerical models [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6671.92s)]
*  better. So the fact that a machine learn model is just simply better is really profound. And the [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6675.839999999999s)]
*  second point is that this machine learn model is only 37 million parameters and can be output in a [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6682.24s)]
*  minute. So you could be running this thing continuously and you can be- [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6686.4s)]
*  Does this work for weather all around the world or just in a specific- [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6690.799999999999s)]
*  Exactly, all around the world. And the second thing that they measured, if you pull up the [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6694.48s)]
*  second graph, was well, okay, great. You can do basic weather forecasting, but are you good at [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6697.44s)]
*  picking up extreme events? The things that are really outside of the normal distribution curve, [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6703.5199999999995s)]
*  the things that we should worry about like cyclones or extreme heat or atmospheric rivers. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6708.719999999999s)]
*  And the answer again is absolutely yes. That this model trained on this data is better at forecasting [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6713.68s)]
*  extreme weather events. On that bottom left one, is it saying that HRS doesn't actually predict [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6721.04s)]
*  cyclone tracking and that GraphCast gives you like two, three, four days lead time? [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6727.52s)]
*  That's just an error difference. Yeah, it's just a measure. It's a measure of delta. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6731.92s)]
*  So what's the downstream effect of this? People will be able to get out of an area that could have [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6736.0s)]
*  extreme weather or insurance. You did climate.com, right? So you've been in this business for a long [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6739.6s)]
*  time. Yeah. So I think one of the most interesting things is how this is going to change how weather [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6745.04s)]
*  forecasting is done. Again, billions of dollars. There's a big system in Japan, a big system in [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6749.84s)]
*  Europe and a big system in the US that forecast the weather. There's some of the biggest compute [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6754.160000000001s)]
*  clusters in the world. And now you can run it in your home. You can run this model in your home [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6757.92s)]
*  because all the weather data that is the input to the model is available all the time on the [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6764.08s)]
*  internet for free. So we could just take that data and anyone could run it. You could get faster [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6768.08s)]
*  results, more frequent updates, certainly a much lower cost. And I think this is just the beginning [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6772.08s)]
*  of obviously a long road of optimization and iteration that will go from here where it'll be [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6777.6s)]
*  really amazing to see what else can be done with this model. It totally upends a lot of different [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6782.8s)]
*  business models as well. What's really important also to note, this is an incredible proof point [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6787.2s)]
*  of these graph neural nets. Graph neural nets can be applied in other areas like chemistry, [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6792.48s)]
*  biology, material science, anywhere where you're simulating physics or physical properties or [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6798.24s)]
*  three-dimensional space over time, showing that you can train off data and be better than [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6803.5199999999995s)]
*  physical models that just use physics to make a prediction. And you can just have the machine [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6808.5599999999995s)]
*  figure out how to do it on its own. And it comes up with this prediction that's better than running [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6813.759999999999s)]
*  physics in a compute cluster. It's really incredible. And I think it'll also, it's a great way to [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6817.28s)]
*  highlight the opportunity for machine learning models being applied to things like chemistry [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6822.16s)]
*  and biology for discovery purposes and other areas over time. I thought it was a great paper, [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6826.08s)]
*  another really incredible proof point by DeepMind. I mean, are they going to just throw away those [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6831.5199999999995s)]
*  clusters running other models now? Dude, I'm telling you like that's redundant. And by the way, [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6837.84s)]
*  talk about accountability. So if I'm running the Department of Commerce, which oversees NOAA in the [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6842.8s)]
*  US, I'm like, what are we doing spending a billion dollars a year on this now? We can just run this [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6847.92s)]
*  thing on a Mac book. So a perfect example of how AI is going to save billions of dollars. This is [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6851.36s)]
*  like an incredible point for the government getting more efficient to circle back around to Dean's [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6855.44s)]
*  point earlier in the episode. Okay. This has been an amazing episode for the dictator himself. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6859.679999999999s)]
*  I want a more accurate forecast of the temperature on Uranus. Oh, it was coming in at any moment. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6865.599999999999s)]
*  Oh man. It depends. Did you have a cold and dark, cold and dark, cold and dark, or maybe you had [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6872.639999999999s)]
*  the hot sauce. Anybody knows. All right. Listen, and for the Sultan of Science, the day after [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6878.24s)]
*  tomorrow, beautiful, it was a great fun movie. David Friedberg and the Rain Man, David Sacks. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6882.0s)]
*  I'm amongst, amongst the world's greatest moderators. Great job the last two weeks, [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6889.679999999999s)]
*  Friedberg. And this is your favorite podcast, the All In Podcast. We'll see you all next time. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6893.36s)]
*  Bye bye. Bye bye. Oh, also, also, also happy Thanksgiving, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6899.36s)]

*  Happy Thanksgiving to everybody. Gobble, gobble. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6912.64s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you for your best. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6917.36s)]
*  What? What? What? [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6935.92s)]
*  Besties are gone. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6940.72s)]
*  That is my dog taking a notice in your driveway. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6941.92s)]
*  Oh, man. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6945.52s)]
*  My avid Azure will meet me at what is called. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6949.2s)]
*  We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6951.12s)]
*  It's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release somehow. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hh8lcoJ1NA&t=6955.04s)]
