# DOGE unveils a roadmap, Unlocking GDP Growth, WW3 escalation, Fat cell memory
**All In Podcast:** [November 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ)
*  Jamal do you hear that free bird got busted looking at porn in his computer? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=8.56s)]
*  You have to go for a quick game of pocket pool, how's your [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=23.84s)]
*  Oh my god, it was too exciting you were beating the bishop Alison came in and just like wondering what was going on [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=26.4s)]
*  She grabbed my computer. She looked at it and it was an essay [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=33.239999999999995s)]
*  I [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=35.76s)]
*  Alright before we get to doge [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=53.4s)]
*  We got a little housekeeping little housey housekeeping, you know, we're getting into the holiday spirit here. It's episode [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=55.879999999999995s)]
*  205 we're in year four and we're having a Christmas party. It's gonna be great the all-in holiday [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=61.44s)]
*  Spectacular is happening in San Francisco on [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=69.32s)]
*  Saturday December 7th. I think the VIP sold out. There's still some tickets left go to all in comm slash events and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=72.84s)]
*  If you can't make it to San Francisco, I think you can buy a ticket for $50 on on the zoom [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=80.84s)]
*  I think we're gonna have it on zoom. Is that right? Am I do I have my facts straight there freeberg? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=88.12s)]
*  Yeah, there's gonna be a live stream [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=93.12s)]
*  Thanks to zoom for setting this up for us. It's kind of interesting [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=95.96s)]
*  They're doing this thing where you could kind of you know, get access to live events [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=99.94s)]
*  So they're helping us get this set up. You want to watch the stream live [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=104.4s)]
*  On zoom anything's possible. It could be spice up through that. All right [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=109.28s)]
*  Listen bestie you on and bestie Vivek wrote an op-ed a barn burner in the Wall Street [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=114.16000000000001s)]
*  Journal about Doge the Department of Government Efficiency and they laid it out [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=121.26s)]
*  They want to cut overbearing and unnecessary regulation. Obviously they want to cut unnecessary [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=126.86s)]
*  Administrative roles save taxpayers money. They want to run it by founders not politicians helping [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=132.72s)]
*  The Trump transition team find a way to hire quote a lean team of small government crusaders [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=138.72s)]
*  Teams gonna work closely with the White House Office of Management and budget. Here's the plan first take aim at [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=145.52s)]
*  500 billion in annual fed federal expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress then fix the government's procurement process by conducting massive audits during [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  Temporary payment suspensions. This is an interesting playbook that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  Elon has done before so basically suspend all the payments and hey let everybody [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=165.8s)]
*  Audit those payments drive change through executive action based on existing legislation rather than passing new laws and to [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=172.32s)]
*  Scodas rulings are gonna play a major role here West Virginia versus EPA [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=180.72s)]
*  That's when SCOTUS rule that federal agencies can't impose regulations dealing with major economic or policy questions unless [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=185.36s)]
*  Congress authorizes them to do so and Luper Bright versus Raimondo [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=192.76s)]
*  That's from 2024 and that overturned the Chevron Doctrine. We talked about that in a previous episode [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=197.24s)]
*  So according to Doge when combined [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=202.72s)]
*  Quote these cases suggest that a plethora of current federal regulations exceed the authority Congress has granted under the law [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=205.52s)]
*  Doge will use software and legal experts to create a list of regulations that Trump can immediately pause [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=214.28s)]
*  They're gonna make some sort of a leaderboard Elon said and [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  Vivek said he would do he suspended his existing podcast [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=225.12s)]
*  I didn't know he had a podcast but he's doing a Doge cast a Doge podcast and so [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=228.56s)]
*  Freiburg this has been you know, a major issue for you. You've been talking about on this podcast that the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=234.56s)]
*  unsustainable [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=241.84s)]
*  existential issue for our country is all of the debt we have [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  What are the chances [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=248.12s)]
*  That this is going to occur because obviously we all know the machine is going to fight [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  To preserve the machine chances that we are sitting here in four years and we've seen meaningful cuts in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=255.36s)]
*  Spending and a meaningful reduction in size of the government [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=261.6s)]
*  Look, it's Doge has probably 18 months to do what they can do before the midterms [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  And there's gonna be an inevitable amount of recoil and backlash that's gonna arise from [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=271.84000000000003s)]
*  The actions that they're gonna try and take and President Trump's gonna try and take [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=276.8s)]
*  under the recommendations provided by Doge [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=281.24s)]
*  So they need to move fast and aggressively and that's only gonna cause the recoil to be harder and faster [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=284.4s)]
*  There's gonna be a ton of litigation. Obviously everything's gonna go to court. It's gonna be [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=290.26s)]
*  Incredibly politicized what is frustrating and challenging to me is that there is nothing that they said that doesn't seem obvious and right [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=295.15999999999997s)]
*  I don't know how you can politicize the points that they're making put aside their party put aside who they are individually [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=303.12s)]
*  Put aside how we got here at the end of the day this federal government needs to be run more efficiently more effectively [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=309.64s)]
*  It is unfair and it is a tax on every one of us to have money thrown away [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=316.64s)]
*  To have wasted capital to have bureaucracy that gets in the way of people being able to do their jobs [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  It is a tax on all of us and our kids and our future [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=327.56s)]
*  It needs to be fixed if it doesn't get fixed as I've said countless times before [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=330.76s)]
*  We are in an arithmetic debt depth spiral. There is no way out of it [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=334.96s)]
*  So by resolving both the inefficiency reducing the bureaucracy stopping the wasteful spending having accountability in the org in the government [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=339.88s)]
*  We can actually get the United States another 50 years a hundred years whatever long we want [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=347.98s)]
*  But we were literally in a death spiral leading up to this moment and I have no idea how we ended up on this timeline [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=353.52s)]
*  I was over the moon and shocked when I read all of the progress over the last couple of weeks and putting this thing together [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=359.86s)]
*  I did not know that this is where we were end up [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  I couldn't be more happy with what I think is gonna happen with Doge and its effect on [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  If not actually making the changes shining a light on the issues that need to be addressed and I will say it is unfair [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=372.66s)]
*  To Americans for this to be politicized the Democrats shouldn't make this a Republican issue [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=379.5s)]
*  This is not about Republicans doing damage [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=386.02000000000004s)]
*  This is about doing the right thing for the government for the country and the Democrats had an opportunity to own this issue and instead [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=388.14s)]
*  They've chosen to oppose it which makes no sense [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=394.5s)]
*  It is frustrating and challenging to me as an American to think that this is even a political point [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=397.21999999999997s)]
*  This should be a what's right for America point [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=402.02s)]
*  It's almost like we're going to war war with ourselves with our bureaucracy with the morass [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=404.14s)]
*  That's been built up over the last couple of decades and I'm thrilled that this is happening and frankly put the put the people aside [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=408.58s)]
*  Maybe it's the fact that you need people that are as outspoken as challenging as difficult as these two particular individuals [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=415.14000000000004s)]
*  They're gonna run this group, but that might be what it takes for it to happen in the small 18-month window that they have [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=422.54s)]
*  Yeah, great rant and we had a Milton Friedman clip go viral and he spoke exactly about his positions on what he would eliminate [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=429.70000000000005s)]
*  Departments like agriculture commerce education. Let's just play that clip and then there was obviously the Malay interview [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=438.58000000000004s)]
*  By Lex Friedman earlier this week keep them or abolish them Department of Agriculture [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=445.02s)]
*  abolish gone Department of Commerce [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=450.18s)]
*  Abolish gone Department of Defense keep keep it Department of Education abolish gone energy [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=453.62s)]
*  Abolish Health and Human Services. There is room for some public health activities to prevent [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=461.58s)]
*  Contagious will eliminate half of the Department of Health. Yeah, something like okay one half. There we go. Housing and Urban Development [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=468.62s)]
*  Done that's gone Department of the Interior the problem there is you first have to sell off all the land that the government owns [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=474.7s)]
*  But that's what you should do [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=481.86s)]
*  Department of Justice. Oh, yes, keep that one. Labor. No gone state keep keep it transportation [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=486.3s)]
*  gone [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=494.82s)]
*  the Treasury [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=496.65999999999997s)]
*  You have to keep it to collect taxes. All right collect taxes through the Treasury Saks [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=498.14s)]
*  You see that clip you see the activity going on with Doge [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=502.14000000000004s)]
*  Would you think that the machine will allow what Milton Friedman is describing there what Javier Amelie is doing in Argentina and what? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=506.94s)]
*  Elon is proposing with Doge. Do you think the machine is going to allow? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=516.46s)]
*  You know the wholesale [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=520.74s)]
*  deleting of [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=523.22s)]
*  Department of Agriculture Department of Education at a federal level and move all that stuff to the states [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=524.86s)]
*  What do you think's gonna happen here and how hard will the machine fight back against this in your mind because hey you might have [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=529.5s)]
*  Some Republicans some Democrats they fought really hard to get jobs to get [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=537.62s)]
*  Subsidies to put in factories whatever from the federal government. Are they gonna just give that all back? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=541.98s)]
*  The clip is from 1998 by the way, it's actually that's [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=547.0600000000001s)]
*  Well that Milton Friedman clip as great as it is. I mean it really is outstanding [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=551.5s)]
*  Is setting expectations a little bit too high here [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=556.14s)]
*  I mean, we're not gonna be able to wipe out entire major departments of the government that are cabinet level positions [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=559.46s)]
*  I don't think that's in the cards [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=564.58s)]
*  You know what Milton Friedman's basically describing is a night watchman state and I don't think we're gonna get back to that. However [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=567.02s)]
*  if you look right now at the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=573.5s)]
*  opinions on the legacy media MSDNC CNN all that kind of stuff [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=577.3s)]
*  They are [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=581.9s)]
*  Forecasting that Doge is gonna amount to nothing. They're basically saying that the powers that be in Washington are gonna reject it completely [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=583.34s)]
*  There's somehow gonna be a falling out between [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=589.66s)]
*  Elon and DJT. They're just very cynical [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=592.0600000000001s)]
*  And then you have people who are not [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=595.7s)]
*  necessarily [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=599.74s)]
*  dismissive in that way in [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=601.1s)]
*  The media but just kind of longtime Washington insiders who feel like they've seen it all before nothing ever happens [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=603.5s)]
*  So they're just very jaded and cynical so I would say that you know again [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=609.58s)]
*  I wouldn't have the expectations of the Milton Friedman level [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=613.36s)]
*  But I think that the expectations for Doge right now are being set incredibly low [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=616.44s)]
*  By the media and by the Washington insiders and I think there are good reasons to believe that the results will surpass [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=620.7800000000001s)]
*  those those low expectations [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=628.46s)]
*  number one is you've got Elon Musk running this thing with favek and [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=631.22s)]
*  Elon understands better than anybody the impact of deleterious regulations on business [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=636.7s)]
*  So he could really put a microscope on that [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=641.98s)]
*  he's got the largest speech platform in the world with X the largest account on X and he's also built a [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=644.46s)]
*  Get out the vote operation that he funded in the last election that he's promised to keep around and potentially expand [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=651.5400000000001s)]
*  So his influence hopefully is not going anywhere [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=659.38s)]
*  He's gonna be able to keep using that to help keep politicians on side here, right? Yeah [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=663.26s)]
*  So that's number one is no one's ever made money betting against Elon Musk [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=670.22s)]
*  And I don't expect that to start right now [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=674.9s)]
*  number two is you got the vague who is co-ed with [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=676.9399999999999s)]
*  Elon of this thing and I think he's a perfect partner for Elon because the vague first of all [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=680.7s)]
*  He's a brilliant guy with a lot of success in business, but he's also a harvard trained lawyer [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=686.2s)]
*  He's a brilliant legal mind and I think you could see in that op-ed [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=691.18s)]
*  I suspect the parts that were citing all those from court decisions were his influence and so they figured out a legal [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=694.9799999999999s)]
*  Roadmap here. It's not just a matter of kind of going to Congress and hoping Congress acts. They've got a way here [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=701.66s)]
*  Sequentially to do this through the executive branch through executive orders going through the court system [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=709.02s)]
*  They've kind of got a game plan here. That's not entirely reliant on legislation [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=714.3399999999999s)]
*  So I think the vakes [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=718.38s)]
*  Influence and and sort of legal strategic mind is a is a big asset here [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=721.66s)]
*  And then I think the third reason to be optimistic is just the fact that this was printed on the Wall Street Journal op-ed page [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=726.5999999999999s)]
*  Is suggested in and of itself what this shows is that? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=733.38s)]
*  this doge effort is I think uniting both the kind of populist reformers and the establishment types within the party if [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=738.26s)]
*  Elon and [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=746.98s)]
*  The vague we're trying to get a mandate for no more forever war. I don't think the Wall Street Journal [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=749.1s)]
*  Yeah, publishing that right just would not happen [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=753.38s)]
*  So there are reasons to believe that this will not actually divide the party that the party could be [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=756.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, could be yeah [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=762.02s)]
*  Now look every congressman and every senator is still going to advocate for their pork barrel project in their district or their state [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=763.3000000000001s)]
*  And it's gonna be very hard to push back on that [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=771.46s)]
*  However, you could imagine a process like we have with the base closure commission when the United States needs to close a bunch of [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=773.46s)]
*  Military bases and they created a an outside commission to recommend the cuts and everyone kind of shared the pain equally [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=779.6600000000001s)]
*  Maybe doge could somehow [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=786.34s)]
*  Play into that or straight a bit. Yeah, so I'm not saying it's gonna be perfect, but I do think that if [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=788.34s)]
*  Republicans [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=794.34s)]
*  share a principle across again both these establishment and the populist side it would be in [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=795.5400000000001s)]
*  Reducing unnecessary regulation and the number of [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=801.9799999999999s)]
*  regulators needed the number of government employees needed to enforce all those regulations [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=806.78s)]
*  So I'm hopeful that they'll be able to get something done within the party and since the Republicans have the trifecta if they've got [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=810.54s)]
*  Trump's leadership and they've got the leadership of the Senate House backing it [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=818.0999999999999s)]
*  I think they'll be able to get something done again. It's not so I mean Milton Freeman level [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=821.8599999999999s)]
*  But I'm optimistic they'll get something good and important done [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=826.5s)]
*  I think the easiest thing for them to get done with doge is the naming the shaming the auditing the [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=829.32s)]
*  Transparency of what we're actually spending because so many of the audits chamath are just not [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=836.2800000000001s)]
*  Completed people don't know what's being spent and if you show Americans a [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=841.96s)]
*  $12,000 hammer or people with job titles not coming into the office or coming into the office one day a week one day a month [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=846.44s)]
*  That's going to infuriate taxpayers and I think there's a very easy way to navigate all this [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=854.2s)]
*  You just create the leaderboard and you not only shame people who are wasting our tax dollars [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=858.4s)]
*  You celebrate the people who are heroes who start showing frugality and cost-saving [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=863.3199999999999s)]
*  And they're going to do this with a leaderboard of the heroes and the goats [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=869.04s)]
*  This could be the unifying not just the Republican Party as a sax is pointing out from off [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=872.52s)]
*  I think this could unify the whole country [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=877.12s)]
*  Is there anybody paying taxes that wants to see money wasted that wants to see us pay people high salaries to not come to work? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=879.1s)]
*  Jamoth what's your take on the sequence of events here? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=886.5600000000001s)]
*  What are easy layups that they could actually get done? And then where is the machine gonna fight and try to stop this thing? I [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=890.2s)]
*  think you [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=898.36s)]
*  Are highlighting something that they can do right away, which I think is very powerful [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=899.96s)]
*  Which is just using these distribution channels that? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=903.6s)]
*  Elon has now to create a massive layer of accountability. I do think that sunshine is a really incredible [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=907.0s)]
*  Disinfectant I think the best way that they could start if possible is to stop paying [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=915.72s)]
*  Their vendors until you actually have some amount of accounting to figure out as you said how many? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=922.36s)]
*  $600 soap dispensers are actually being bought and sold now [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=929.16s)]
*  That kind of whatever you want to call that corruption or grift. It's not going to account for [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=932.68s)]
*  Hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars, but I do think that it is a very moral and symbolic win [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=939.66s)]
*  That says we're going we're going to start to get much more rational and it starts to allow [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=945.6999999999999s)]
*  the average American to actually feel like they have a little bit of control and they have a more vested interest in [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=952.6999999999999s)]
*  How the government spends money, but I want to actually want to take a step back for a second [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=959.62s)]
*  And before I talk about what doge can do [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=964.7199999999999s)]
*  I just want to highlight something that's been going on in California because I think it explains a lot in [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=966.8s)]
*  California and I'm just going to read this that because it's incredible [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=973.3399999999999s)]
*  the regulatory burden in [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=976.64s)]
*  California as a state from 1997 to 2015 [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=979.7199999999999s)]
*  This is when the data is available that I found has increased by almost 50% [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=983.8s)]
*  as [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=988.9599999999999s)]
*  of May of 2022 [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=990.0799999999999s)]
*  There are almost [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=993.56s)]
*  21,000 [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=996.26s)]
*  Individual regulations in the state of California [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=997.8399999999999s)]
*  So what does that mean and where does it come from and Nick if you can just put out the tweet it has happened [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1000.9799999999999s)]
*  Over a period of time in which the government has been the absolute [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1008.04s)]
*  Singular source of employment in the state and [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1015.56s)]
*  We talked about this before where this is also a problem at the federal level when you look at GDP and job growth [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1019.64s)]
*  Because it looks like a lot of these jobs are actually fake manufactured government type jobs [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1025.6399999999999s)]
*  so why is this a problem you've seen in California the issue that we have is that if you have a [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1030.92s)]
*  Growth in the number of employees in this case in California all the job growth in recent memory [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1037.16s)]
*  Has been state employees. What is the byproduct? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1042.6s)]
*  What is the byproduct? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1046.44s)]
*  Regulations go up. What is the byproduct of that? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1048.0s)]
*  There are actually no private sector jobs and more to the point the private sector flees [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1050.52s)]
*  So now let's bubble that up and look at the federal government Nick if you want to just show that chart that I that I sent you [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1055.64s)]
*  What is incredible J Cal is that the more people are hired by the government? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1061.8s)]
*  Lo and behold, what do you see the number of regulations issued by federal agencies has just continued? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1067.76s)]
*  Unabated year in year out you cannot run a country like this [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1075.04s)]
*  So because these [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1080.96s)]
*  Accumulate right Congress is doing less and less of a job actually trying to frame how the country should work [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1083.0800000000002s)]
*  That white space is filled in as Freeburg said by these federal agencies it compounds and accumulates [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1089.56s)]
*  This is not replacing laws. None of these regulations have expiry dates [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1096.5800000000002s)]
*  And so as a result I think what you probably have is an incredible restraint on the US economy [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1101.2s)]
*  I think that the US economy could be growing at four or five percent [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1108.1200000000001s)]
*  But the reason it doesn't grow at four or five percent is in that one single chart [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1114.1200000000001s)]
*  It is impossible to be able to live up to your economic potential when you have this burden on your neck [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1118.24s)]
*  So I think the real opportunity for Doge is to basically do whatever it needs to do using the law [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1126.0800000000002s)]
*  To wipe as many of these regulations off the books. We are better [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1133.6000000000001s)]
*  Cutting them all to zero and then finding the ones we really need and then repassing those [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1139.16s)]
*  then we are going at this piecemeal and [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1144.8s)]
*  There's some incredible there's some incredible ideas by the way that this creates [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1147.88s)]
*  Nick I don't know if you can find this tweet but Doge asked what people think of the IRS and [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1152.24s)]
*  There was an enormous amount of activity that essentially said give us a flat tax and wipe out the tax code [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1158.24s)]
*  The people were very flexible in the amount of tax that they were willing to pay but could you imagine the [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1165.88s)]
*  Simplification in the tax code and the implications of that. I was in Singapore by the way ten days ago when I started my trip [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1172.24s)]
*  Nick beep out the name of the person I'm about to say but [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1179.0s)]
*  I had a long meeting with [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1181.72s)]
*  you know is there and [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1183.84s)]
*  I was asking him the complexity of [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1185.88s)]
*  Dealing with taxes. He's like, what do you mean? We don't we pay a very simple tax system [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1189.44s)]
*  There's no capital gains in Singapore. And so as a result our filing requirements are de minimis Lee small [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1194.6000000000001s)]
*  But as a result people like him meaning great entrepreneurs [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1200.4s)]
*  Can spend all their time thinking about what to build not not tax optimization [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1204.3600000000001s)]
*  Exactly or not or how to account for it [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1209.72s)]
*  so could you imagine if these guys basically use Doge as a mechanism to [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1212.0s)]
*  Shrink the tax code create a flat tax potentially. I know that that has to be passed by Congress. I understand that [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1216.42s)]
*  but the idea of just cutting this all the way down and [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1223.52s)]
*  Then finding through that process what you actually need I think can find America a hundred [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1228.16s)]
*  200 basis points of GDP growth it could be an economic Renaissance [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1235.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean just to build on that cutting all the regulations to zero you might [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1238.92s)]
*  Have throw out some babies in the bathwater. So why not put a clock on them and just say whenever this was enacted [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1243.3600000000001s)]
*  Plus five years and then it rolls off or plus two years whatever number of months and then you could have them Chamath [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1249.28s)]
*  Rolling off every month. I think that's a good idea, but it has to be quarterly. I think that's a good idea [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1256.0800000000002s)]
*  But Jake how I think you first have to cancel all these regulations and then say whatever we need we will reenact [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1261.44s)]
*  Your point on a five-year shot clock that then has to be renewed in a new congressional period [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1268.16s)]
*  And I think that that's extremely healthy. Well, because you know what people die [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1274.0s)]
*  Paradigms shift and then nobody even remembers these regulations [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1277.8000000000002s)]
*  You have to do archaeology to figure out who created this [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1281.2800000000002s)]
*  What was the intent and you would never do that? You would never live sacks with all of these rules forever [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1283.8000000000002s)]
*  Just one last comment in fairness to these government employees [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1290.18s)]
*  The one thing is that it's not their fault, right? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1293.8000000000002s)]
*  Meaning in the sense that they were hired into a regime where the incentive was to [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1296.3000000000002s)]
*  Regulate so that you had things to oversee and so they did their job [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1303.02s)]
*  In fact, I would say they did their job incredibly well [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1307.46s)]
*  But the point is that now we need to pivot for them to do a totally different job. Well, it's a mock [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1309.7s)]
*  I'll hand this one free free break free break if you [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1314.02s)]
*  Were to get rid of regulations as somebody working in the government you might work your way out of a job [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1316.7s)]
*  So the incentive is completely perverse and reverse to what we actually need in the country [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1321.78s)]
*  Which is less regulation more thoughtful regulation and some process by taking these things on and off the books and adapting them to reality [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1327.46s)]
*  Yeah, this is where I think [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1334.66s)]
*  I think we've talked about this many too many times in the past [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1337.82s)]
*  But like all organizations have a natural tendency to grow they want to grow [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1340.5s)]
*  They want to grow they're not yes like find me one nonprofit or find me one university or find me one company or [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1345.22s)]
*  One government agency that's ever said my job is to shrink myself. It's never happened [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1352.74s)]
*  So why does that happen? Well, if you look at the like day-to-day [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1358.3s)]
*  Operating role of each individual over time like all individuals they want to do more. They want to have a bigger impact [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1362.74s)]
*  They want to have more scale. They want to have more leverage [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1368.98s)]
*  So there's this natural set of incentives that drives a lot of choices and operating procedures on the ground that create more structure [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1371.3s)]
*  More scale more leverage and drive more hiring. Everyone wants to become a manager of people [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1378.98s)]
*  They don't want to just be doing the same IC job forever individual contributor job forever [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1384.54s)]
*  So if they want to be a manager they got to find more stuff to do and then they got to hire people to do [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1388.22s)]
*  That stuff so all of these organizations whether again and we've all been on boards of nonprofits [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1392.46s)]
*  I'm sure and we've all been involved in this sort of thing [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1397.48s)]
*  There's always this like [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1399.78s)]
*  Incentive to raise more capital to hire more people to do more stuff that sort of it's really unclear until you really dig into the [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1401.1s)]
*  Psychology of each individual person working there why this is happening [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1407.5s)]
*  I don't think that the federal government is any different each of these people feel they want to be more important [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1410.3799999999999s)]
*  They want to have a bigger role. They want to have a bigger impact [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1415.6399999999999s)]
*  So it's a good job, right? If your job direct [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1419.1399999999999s)]
*  Directionally is to regulate then what's the scalar on regulation more regulation? [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1422.22s)]
*  So therefore to do more you have to regulate more [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1427.4199999999998s)]
*  There's no regulator that says I want to regulate less over time because we've created a system that's one directional [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1430.22s)]
*  So you have to have these resets if you don't have them naturally they're gonna happen [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1436.06s)]
*  unnaturally in the form of social unrest and breakdowns of the economy and [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1440.58s)]
*  Collapse of social structure is all these other things that happen way way down or as Chamath is pointing out in California in the economic [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1445.06s)]
*  structure of California [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1451.3999999999999s)]
*  Which I think is happening on a kind of national scale because of the outside world the federal government plays in our national economy here today [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1452.54s)]
*  So so you have to have these unnatural forces come in and do this readjustment from time to time [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1459.18s)]
*  Otherwise, it's just gonna break on its own and [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1465.18s)]
*  Millay in Argentina has a basically I don't know a year or an 18 month head start on us and has been doing this [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1468.62s)]
*  He did a great podcast with Lex Friedman [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1476.18s)]
*  They translated it actually they dubbed it which is kind of interesting technology and [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1479.38s)]
*  In this discussion they talked about reducing the ministry's agencies from 20 to 8 [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1484.62s)]
*  They fired 50,000 government workers 15% of the total workforce [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1491.26s)]
*  There were 341 thousand when he started they implemented daily deregulation process to remove inefficient policies [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1495.7s)]
*  So they just do that day in and day out they ended discretionary payments to provinces and cities [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1502.82s)]
*  The restored market driven utility prices no more subsidies. Yada. Yada. Yada right down the line [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1507.86s)]
*  sex your thoughts on [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1513.02s)]
*  How many months it will take to do this and there's this this discussion and I don't know if that's from inside [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1515.9799999999998s)]
*  The Trump administration of hey, we got to get this done in 18 months. We got to get this done in 18 months [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1523.5s)]
*  What can you tell us about the the sense of urgency about getting this done quickly? [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1528.1399999999999s)]
*  in and why that's occurring [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1533.2199999999998s)]
*  Well, I think Elon and Vivek have announced that Doge will be [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1536.0600000000002s)]
*  Sunsetting or disbanding at the 250th anniversary of America, which would be July 4th of [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1541.22s)]
*  2026 so they've only given themselves about what's that 18 months? Yep, which kind of makes sense, right? [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1549.22s)]
*  That's leading into the midterms, right? Right exactly. You tend to have the most [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1555.8200000000002s)]
*  Momentum coming off an election like this one where you have the trifecta [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1560.32s)]
*  So I think that makes a lot of sense that they're gonna be able to have the greatest impact [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1564.12s)]
*  Let's say in the first year after the new [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1568.48s)]
*  President Congress gets sworn in. How do you get Democrats in on this sex? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1571.9199999999998s)]
*  How do you push them to join the party to join the movement to be more efficient to be more transparent? [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1575.72s)]
*  Is there a possibility for us to get some? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1582.8s)]
*  Coordination here with the other side or no [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1586.26s)]
*  Maybe you might be able to get some support of particular Democrats on particular things. I don't want to say that it's not possible [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1588.62s)]
*  difficult, but not not impossible [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1595.9s)]
*  But look, I think what Millet has done in Argentina is remarkable [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1599.1s)]
*  I mean that was a country that was a total basket case inflation was out of control [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1603.78s)]
*  It's already because of the cuts he's made [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1608.3799999999999s)]
*  They now have a more normal inflation rate and they've gone from basically being [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1610.7s)]
*  Uninvestable to investible as a country now [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1616.38s)]
*  The United States is not the basket case that Argentina is but we are on an unsustainable [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1619.94s)]
*  Fiscal trajectory doge is also not going to have the power that Millet has not gonna have the degrees of freedom to act [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1625.86s)]
*  But we also don't have as big a problem [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1631.82s)]
*  What we need to do is just bend our fiscal to purr from being unsustainable to being sustainable [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1634.3s)]
*  And if we can do that, it'll have a huge impact on the economy [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1639.34s)]
*  specifically [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1643.82s)]
*  What we saw in the last election the thing that probably hurt the Democrats the most was inflation [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1644.86s)]
*  Voters clearly do not like inflation. They do not like the diminishment of their purchasing power [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1650.34s)]
*  But how do you stop inflation? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1656.1s)]
*  You have to raise interest rates and that's not good either because that raises the cost of a mortgage that raises the cost of a car [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1657.4599999999998s)]
*  payment is bad for investment, right because if interest rates are higher then that means the discount rate on [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1664.3s)]
*  stocks and real estate on every investment class basically is higher and [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1670.5s)]
*  The hurdle rate for investments higher so high interest rates are also bad for the economy [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1675.86s)]
*  So how do you get out of that box where you either have high inflation or high interest rates? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1680.5s)]
*  The only way is to bend the fiscal curve to that more sustainable path [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1684.4599999999998s)]
*  And if you can and if you can do that the bond markets will actually give you credit for it in advance [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1689.02s)]
*  Because they know that because they know that they're not gonna be flooded with the need to keep funding all of this US government debt [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1696.02s)]
*  So we either get to kind of you know startups have this saying about being either default alive or default dead [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1703.5600000000002s)]
*  We either get to default sustainable or default and sustainable right now [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1709.6000000000001s)]
*  We're unsustainable the bond markets know it inflation remains persistently high around 3% [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1713.24s)]
*  The Fed has not been able to cut interest rates the way that they expected to remember the markets were expecting seven cuts this year [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1719.1200000000001s)]
*  We got basically three we got a 50 and a 25 [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1726.1200000000001s)]
*  So it's just hasn't been the cuts that people were expecting and that's because inflation hasn't come down as much to your thoughts [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1729.24s)]
*  So if doge working with the rest of the government OMB the Treasury [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1734.6s)]
*  Congress executive orders cannot convince the markets that the US financial picture is more sustainable [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1741.24s)]
*  We'll get credit for that interest rates will come down and that'll lead to a boom in the economy [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1747.4s)]
*  So it's all win-win if they can pull this off [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1752.96s)]
*  Pre break any final thoughts here before we move on from doge wishing Elon and Vivek [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1756.32s)]
*  As much success as possible [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1762.04s)]
*  We've really I mean everybody should be rooting for this you want to give us your final thoughts. I [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1764.36s)]
*  Feel like America is neo from the matrix [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1770.84s)]
*  where there was like a thousand bullets being shot at America and [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1775.84s)]
*  We like literally had to dodge every single one of them in order to get to this this point [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1779.9599999999998s)]
*  I again I am so shocked and surprised in a positive way [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1785.4799999999998s)]
*  That we ended up on this particular timeline [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1790.24s)]
*  Look everything had to go the way it went for this to have happened Biden decided to run for [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1792.8799999999999s)]
*  Re-election Biden stayed in too long. They didn't run a primary. They put Kamala in [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1798.4799999999998s)]
*  You want the fences switch party on you on decided to throw a hundred million bucks at the problem Elon bought Twitter [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1803.3999999999999s)]
*  China had a real estate bubble [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1810.96s)]
*  I mean you can go down the list of things that had to go right for us to get to this very moment [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1812.76s)]
*  Where a small group of people have recognized the fiscal death spiral that the United States? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1818.12s)]
*  federal government has been in and have the authority and the [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1824.96s)]
*  Capacity and the skills to be able to go and execute against a solution. I [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1829.8799999999999s)]
*  Have no idea how this could have been architected [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe sacks knew all along and I convinced him two years ago that this was how things had to go and he's been designing it [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1837.9199999999998s)]
*  Like maybe you're talking about Ray Dalio on the end of the Empire for three years [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1843.32s)]
*  Maybe as we did it free bird we give you remember when we talk with Dalio about this. He's like doctor [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1847.8799999999999s)]
*  And also around the the relationship with China, which I think this is all very tightly related [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1852.84s)]
*  We may have dodged a lot of bullets. Hmm, and if the United States can get its house in order [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1859.26s)]
*  Reduce federal spending while increasing [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1865.74s)]
*  economic activity [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1868.66s)]
*  It can be a tremendous unlock for the US and for world peace [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1870.26s)]
*  So because again, I think that conflict arises when we don't have our own fiscal house in order [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1874.74s)]
*  And so I feel very positive more more surprised and positive than I was a year ago six months ago [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1879.34s)]
*  It's just amazing. We're on this timeline and I do think the United States as neo dodged a lot of bullets here [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1886.26s)]
*  I told you everything was proceeding as I had foreseen [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1892.42s)]
*  You know what happened to the tenure and Elon and Vivek wrote that essay I actually don't what happened yields contracted by five basis points [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1896.9s)]
*  You know the value that is a [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1904.1s)]
*  Couple billion 15 billion per year. Yeah. Yeah. So so I think that it was probably a hundred billion dollar essay [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1906.42s)]
*  Just writing it. I think you will find that this doge is quite operational [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1914.56s)]
*  I mean, I think it's got a chance. I mean [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1922.76s)]
*  Right, I want I want all I want all Americans and Democrats to stand up and say this is the right thing for the United States [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1928.04s)]
*  I have to get about the fact guys [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1934.68s)]
*  Yeah, essay saved us a hundred billion just the essay. Here's the [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1936.8s)]
*  Going to say a day [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1941.44s)]
*  They're gonna have to be very strategic true about how they detailed what they're doing. Yeah [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1944.2800000000002s)]
*  The the doge teams is gonna have to be very strategic to pick things that are consensus building [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1949.4s)]
*  That don't make people feel like this is gonna grind the poor more and make the rich richer. That's the expectation [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1954.96s)]
*  That's gonna be the negative framing on this [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1961.96s)]
*  I predict which is it's just a bunch of rich guys making cuts [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1964.0400000000002s)]
*  Talking their books making cuts for things that are their pet projects their investments [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1967.62s)]
*  They have to come out and not make it that they have to make it. Here's inefficiency. Here's inefficiency [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1972.4199999999998s)]
*  Here's an efficiency and a great way to do that would be to say the efficiency gains and the tax cuts are gonna go to [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1977.26s)]
*  People making let's say under $250,000. These are not these cuts are not being made just to make the rich richer [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1982.8999999999999s)]
*  That's gonna be the framing but just my best advice. Don't you think that that's gonna happen? No matter what? [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1989.62s)]
*  What which part of it that they're gonna say that no matter what so I I actually disagree with the first part of what you said [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=1995.1000000000001s)]
*  I agree with you that the media the mainstream media will try to characterize this as [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2001.38s)]
*  Hurting the poor I agree and I'm not sure yet. Yeah, whether it's or not [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2006.7s)]
*  Yeah, but I think the first part I disagree with is I don't think they should operate towards consensus [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2010.6200000000001s)]
*  I think that they should do what's right [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2016.58s)]
*  Well, you could do what's right and you could start with things that are the most wasteful like if you start cutting [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2018.82s)]
*  kids lunches or Pell grants [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2024.6200000000001s)]
*  Or you start cutting people's jobs to in health care education that people perceive are helping people [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2027.5s)]
*  I think you're gonna just feed into this narrative that it's a way to cut taxes on rich people [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2034.6200000000001s)]
*  And you know what you do need to build consensus. How does that thing is on rich people? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2041.02s)]
*  If you cut regulations and a bunch of our companies benefit from it just to be self-aware [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2046.3s)]
*  The framing is already that this is an effort for companies that we invest in to [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2052.24s)]
*  Have less regulation to make the equity holders in those companies more rich [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2059.44s)]
*  I just make sure that the hold on it's for all you have to make sure the savings is for all Americans and that all [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2063.68s)]
*  Americans benefit from it and the way they benefit it the best framing they could do is [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2069.56s)]
*  Your taxes are gonna be lower because you're not wasting your tax dollars if they can keep to that not hey [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2073.44s)]
*  We're moving regulation so that our companies to be honest [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2079.76s)]
*  Yeah, yeah being a hairdresser requires more regulation than being any one of most of my companies [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2082.96s)]
*  So I actually think it benefits I think it benefits other people way way more than it benefits me [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2088.4s)]
*  And you have to show it is my point show it [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2093.5200000000004s)]
*  That's the point is you have to show people that you're doing this for everybody not just for the people on this podcast and our [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2095.92s)]
*  Friends that's gonna be the key what you're off just said is so important. There's a great interview [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2102.7000000000003s)]
*  I've mentioned this in the past between Tim Ferriss and Charles Koch from a couple years ago where he brings up this exact example [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2107.44s)]
*  Yes about how regulatory burdens make it difficult for women to become hairdressers [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2113.4s)]
*  It's like seven thousand dollars [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2118.0s)]
*  So they don't have the capital to do that because of the regulatory [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2119.36s)]
*  Yeah burden to get there think about building building your home or you know [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2122.0s)]
*  Like let's say you want to change put a shower in your bathroom change the shower in your bathroom [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2126.2400000000002s)]
*  You don't want to spend fifteen thousand dollars on all the permitting regulatory stuff to make that happen [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2130.44s)]
*  It's gonna unlock value for everyone. That's a small example of kind of a regulatory problem [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2135.04s)]
*  But this benefits everyone and the cost and my point is you have to communicate that you have to be able to communicate that [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2139.56s)]
*  And that's where using [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2146.44s)]
*  Perfect job of communicating this to people and that's the playbook freeburg. That's my point [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2151.8s)]
*  People are gonna fight this you have to convince them. You have to show them that this is helping [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2156.8s)]
*  Agree that they're okay, but that's different than how you started you said only work on consensus projects. I know I did say that [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2162.28s)]
*  I think you have that is like those do them first. I said do those first make sure that people understand [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2168.0s)]
*  This is to save them money. I'm not saying that you don't change regulations for [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2173.52s)]
*  Spaceships and self-driving cars as well [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2177.88s)]
*  But you have to make sure you show people that this can benefit them or else they're gonna just fight it [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2180.04s)]
*  And then that's gonna be the whole all this effort will be for not [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2185.36s)]
*  If you if you get a bunch of Republicans sacks who start fighting this and you have a splintering in your party because [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2188.92s)]
*  They feel like this isn't helping their local constituents. This whole thing could be for not [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2194.56s)]
*  That that's my story that you told is gonna be told by the legacy media and all the haters and the enemies [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2199.36s)]
*  Regardless of what you want. I don't think so. I don't think so. I think people [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2207.12s)]
*  You show people [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2214.6s)]
*  You know, no show I'm talking about the public election [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2216.7999999999997s)]
*  Now's the time to implement when you show people twenty two thousand dollar, you know hammers and wasted money [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2220.8399999999997s)]
*  You will get a hundred percent of Americans [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2226.56s)]
*  Backing this not sixty minutes for thirty years. Nothing's happened. We got to just act now [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2229.36s)]
*  Yeah act and bring people along with communications. I mean if you got if you're [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2234.96s)]
*  Poorly great. No for it. Yeah, I'm not saying that communication isn't part of the job [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2239.64s)]
*  In fact this whole conversation started by us talking about an op-ed [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2244.04s)]
*  Yes, I'm a vague road, correct [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2248.36s)]
*  Right in which they're laying out their objectives and they're doing podcasts and yeah [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2251.36s)]
*  Elon has the biggest platform in the world and biggest following [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2255.04s)]
*  so I just don't think communications can be the problem, but you're also not gonna be able to convince everyone and [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2258.32s)]
*  You know, we've already won the election and now's the time to figure out very strategically how to implement as much as possible [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2263.64s)]
*  Be humble by two million votes keep it in mind you have to bring everybody along [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2269.92s)]
*  Okay, you know what? [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2273.9s)]
*  It was fair. It would have been 20 million votes for trunk to have one under these circumstances and he won the trifecta [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2275.2400000000002s)]
*  It's impressive [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2282.52s)]
*  Nobody's not impressive. I'm not minimizing it. I'm just saying be aware [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2284.6s)]
*  There's 74 million people who are rooting against Trump and I think getting some no, they're not I'm on that's not true [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2288.56s)]
*  That's not true [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2295.2999999999997s)]
*  I think there's a decent number of people who are probably very upset that you know Trump won just like last time [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2295.8599999999997s)]
*  They were upset that Biden won [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2301.7799999999997s)]
*  Including all Americans in this is the most virtuous thing you can do [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2303.8199999999997s)]
*  I think it's everybody should get on board. I think it I think it's deranged the idea that 74 million people are actually rooting against him [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2307.3999999999996s)]
*  I don't think that that's true. I don't think they feel good that they lost people don't feel good about losing [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2313.7799999999997s)]
*  Bringing those people on board is virtuous. There's already been a huge [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2319.7s)]
*  Shift in the country have you seen the Trump dance? I mean there's been such a [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2323.38s)]
*  Let's see it. Let's see it. I'm not gonna do it right now, but there's been such a huge vibe shift [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2327.98s)]
*  The energy right now is incredible and I think people are feeling much more optimistic [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2338.7000000000003s)]
*  Can you imagine what a downer would it be if like we were expecting? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2342.78s)]
*  President Kamala Harris take the oath of office [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2346.38s)]
*  It would be a downer to me if they were still pushing a seven point two trillion dollar federal budget next year [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2349.1400000000003s)]
*  That would be a downer and by the way, I think that there's a deeply linked relationship between social issues [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2355.58s)]
*  economic issues political policies and [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2362.46s)]
*  Foreign conflict they all seem like they're four different things, but they're so tightly interwound and [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2365.46s)]
*  It's interesting how everything kind of moves together with this shift in who ended up wanting winning this election cycle [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2371.8199999999997s)]
*  And I think it really speaks to the relationship between the four. Well, by the way, there's a great [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2378.5s)]
*  meme that was floating around where it showed a photo of [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2384.06s)]
*  Trump Elon Bobby Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard and it said that all four of the fuel used to be Democrats. Yep. Yep [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2388.7799999999997s)]
*  Rogan in it. I tweeted that [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2397.1s)]
*  Used to be that that Democrats were progressive progressive means progress looking forward and the last decade the last couple years in particular [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2399.7799999999997s)]
*  I think a lot of people that I know that are former Democrats and tomorrow if you can speak for yourself [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2407.8199999999997s)]
*  Feel like the Democrats stopped looking forward and it was all about trying to like [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2413.1s)]
*  pessimistic and grievance and [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2418.14s)]
*  And all of a sudden you've got guys like Elon [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2420.8199999999997s)]
*  Promoting themselves as Republicans highlighting that it's all this is the party that looks forward. This is the party that drives progress [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2423.7400000000002s)]
*  It's an amazing shift. I [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2429.98s)]
*  Don't know if there's been anything like it that's happened this quickly [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2432.38s)]
*  And I voted more to make America great again than I did vote for being a Republican [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2435.22s)]
*  I think that the Republican Party right totally is [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2441.04s)]
*  Is less important than it's ever been and I think MAGA is more important than it's ever been. I [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2444.78s)]
*  Agree and I'd say the biggest risk to the whole agenda. It probably is not the Democrats [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2449.98s)]
*  it's actually some of these old bulls in Congress who are [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2453.9s)]
*  Anti MAGA for some reason Trump is the one who just won the trifecta. He just won this big election [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2459.7400000000002s)]
*  If you stick with the old Republican message, you're just a surefire loser [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2466.2200000000003s)]
*  So give Trump his due as the leader of the party realize it's now a MAGA party and let's get some things done [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2470.26s)]
*  If the reform agenda fails to be frank [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2477.14s)]
*  It probably is not gonna be the Democrats is probably going to be these holdouts and the Republican Party [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2479.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that was my question earlier. I think I asked it twice. I didn't get anybody to engage in it [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2484.5s)]
*  How do you convince them? How are they being brought on board to this if they have all this pork barrel spending? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2490.66s)]
*  Is there a strategy there? Would you have a strategy? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2496.1s)]
*  I think sacks laid it out, which is that if you use the combination of the carrot and the stick [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2498.38s)]
*  I think the carrot is [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2502.98s)]
*  Creating transparency and I think the other part of the carrot is [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2504.98s)]
*  You'll have now an extremely well funded pack that can support people who are on board with this agenda [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2510.42s)]
*  But the stick is if you don't I think that if Elon makes this a really concerted [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2517.78s)]
*  Long-term part of his strategy, then I think you should run candidates who actually are aligned with the agenda [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2523.22s)]
*  That the make America great again movement wants [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2528.66s)]
*  So I think that's the carrot and stick Jason, which is like some of these old Republicans will have to decide do I [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2532.58s)]
*  basically help invest in a renewal of the American spirit or do I keep pushing back because I like the way it was and I [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2538.7400000000002s)]
*  Want to go to war and I want to cozy up to these lobbyists. I think those folks are gonna have a very [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2544.02s)]
*  tough [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2549.62s)]
*  Four and eight years because I think you'll see a bunch of MAGA candidates rising up to run against them everywhere in the United States [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2551.06s)]
*  As you can see my young apprentice your friends have failed [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2557.7s)]
*  Now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station, man [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2562.2599999999998s)]
*  I said be humble like three times none of it's sinking in [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2568.5s)]
*  No, I just explained I explained the risk. I I've been very clear. You're not gonna get Milton Friedman [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2573.14s)]
*  Okay, you're not gonna get Javier Malé. What we can hopefully get is a bending of the curve towards sustainable [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2577.7s)]
*  I'm sitting breaking the curve [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2582.98s)]
*  The curve towards sustainable [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2585.06s)]
*  Tensions to be realistic, okay [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2588.58s)]
*  I mean breaking even would be great if we just weren't adding to the debt. That would be amazing [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2590.98s)]
*  No, I mean look if if the federal budget gets to three trillion [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2595.54s)]
*  And regulation gets cut if you get 50 percent of [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2601.3s)]
*  The regulations in federal agencies cut I think you unleash an economic sonic boom [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2605.86s)]
*  I'm all in on I think I think it's the greatest thing that could ever happen my gosh [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2612.5800000000004s)]
*  Could you imagine america clocking in four percent? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2616.7400000000002s)]
*  I mean how much are you guys stuck with companies? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2620.7400000000002s)]
*  Zero, i'm dealing with not a real regulatory [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2623.7000000000003s)]
*  The regulatory stuff is brutal, man [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2626.42s)]
*  I mean like it's legit brain like melting [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2628.42s)]
*  Tell me your number one regulatory frustration. We can go around the horn. This is a great topic actually [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2632.5800000000004s)]
*  I don't have any I think i'm very blessed to work in an industry that's very light with regulation. I think it affects [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2638.18s)]
*  Many many other industries that if they were unleashed could contribute to american [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2644.02s)]
*  construction [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2649.3s)]
*  Regulations are very regressive because they touch [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2651.46s)]
*  Poor and middle-income people way more than it touched folks like me 100% rip these regulations out [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2654.98s)]
*  Two regulations that do affect you [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2662.02s)]
*  Crypto regulation and capital formation both of those things are they haven't hurt me. They haven't hurt me [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2664.42s)]
*  This is my point is like but they definitely are [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2670.1s)]
*  Economy, right? I can snap a finger and raise a couple billion dollars [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2673.54s)]
*  That is not it's so i'm in a unique position and I and I recognize that what is much harder [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2676.42s)]
*  Is if you're trying to be an electrician if you're trying to be a hairdresser if you're trying to be a massage therapist when you have to spend [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2681.38s)]
*  15 20 30 percent of your salary on licensure why? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2688.02s)]
*  Totally why do we need these stupid rules? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2692.34s)]
*  If you're a person that's trying to like construct a home, why does it take six and eight weeks to get permits approved? Why? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2695.06s)]
*  And there are no good answers for these things. So forget about me like it doesn't matter about me [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2701.7s)]
*  But the mainline part of the united states economy as I said before is a coiled spring [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2706.9s)]
*  If you get rid of those regulations, it disproportionately [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2711.7s)]
*  impacts middle income and lower middle income jobs [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2715.12s)]
*  This is why if you if you see if you see gdp if america clocks in gdp at four to four and a half percent [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2718.8199999999997s)]
*  Watch out folks [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2727.22s)]
*  sonic boom watch out i'll give you two really simple ones allowing [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2728.74s)]
*  Everybody in the united states to participate in company formation [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2733.7s)]
*  Would change everything [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2737.54s)]
*  95 of the company cannot participate in investing in startups or any [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2739.7599999999998s)]
*  You know [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2745.2999999999997s)]
*  Freedom to operate just freedom to do stuff. Well, that's what it is. I mean you're free to go to vegas and gamble [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2750.9s)]
*  You're free to you know [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2756.02s)]
*  Play, you know, I think the next governor of california. You're not free to buy bitcoin. You're not free to buy [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2758.02s)]
*  You are free to buy bitcoin. You can buy what you can. Yeah, but you're not free to create a token [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2762.8199999999997s)]
*  Right. This should be some clear path of regulation. I think there's many more traditional [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2767.2999999999997s)]
*  Forms of economic growth that we can have before we need to make ico's [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2772.9s)]
*  Legal and easier. I want to say something. I think that the person that runs for governor in california [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2777.2200000000003s)]
*  Should commit to cutting those 65 000 regulations down to 10 000 as needed [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2783.14s)]
*  To replacing the dmv with a digital app [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2791.38s)]
*  And to cut taxes to me or zero and to create school choice [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2795.06s)]
*  Whoever does that will create a renaissance in california. It's the fifth largest economy in the world folks [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2800.02s)]
*  And it can be a bellwether for the rest of the world [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2807.06s)]
*  well, you know there there's a lot of scuttlebutt online that nicole shanahan is going to run for governor of california and [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2809.3799999999997s)]
*  I'd be all in favor of that. I would say that of all the [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2816.5s)]
*  political [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2819.94s)]
*  Personalities involved in the election over the past year [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2821.2s)]
*  She gets my most improved award. I remember when like bobby named her [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2824.74s)]
*  To his ticket. I was a little bit skeptical of that choice [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2828.58s)]
*  Because of some of the causes that she had identified with or donated to in the past [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2831.54s)]
*  But she I think has ended up being a star. She's pretty based. She's a yeah, totally [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2835.62s)]
*  I mean, she's she's red pilled and ended up supporting [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2841.06s)]
*  maha and maga [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2844.66s)]
*  And I don't think we're getting anyone better in california. So she's wanting to do it and take it on that'd be awesome [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2846.98s)]
*  Sax what about you? You don't want you don't want that that mansion [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2852.98s)]
*  Um, that'd be a significant downgrade for me. That's about to say [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2856.42s)]
*  Joke right out before I got to it. Damn it. That was such an easy one [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2860.98s)]
*  Yeah, you could live in the governor's mansion also known as smaller than your guest house [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2865.38s)]
*  That would be your backup man cave. Well, actually that's happened people have [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2870.6600000000003s)]
*  In new york. I remember one of the governors was like, yeah, you know i'm good [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2874.5800000000004s)]
*  I don't need to live in the mansion. Where do you want to go next boys? We we have other things on the docket [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2877.78s)]
*  Would you like to go to our war correspondent? Would you like to go from google breakup? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2882.26s)]
*  Would you like to go in video? Where would you like to go world war three? I think is important sax [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2887.38s)]
*  You put world war three on the docket. Would you like to tee it up for us? Yeah [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2891.86s)]
*  Sure. Well, there's several events that have happened in reasonably close succession [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2896.5800000000004s)]
*  The first thing to understand is what's happening on the ground in ukraine. The ukraine has been losing territory at an accelerating pace [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2900.7400000000002s)]
*  There's an excellent graphic in the new york times that i'll put on the screen that shows this [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2907.78s)]
*  It's not a stalemate. Remember I sit on this podcast [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2912.42s)]
*  Six months or a year ago that it was no longer a stalemate [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2915.94s)]
*  It was a war of attrition in which the ukrainians were now losing [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2918.82s)]
*  And every single month now the russians are taking more and more territory again [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2922.1000000000004s)]
*  The curve is accelerating we had all invested in a business who had a growth curve that looked like this [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2925.5400000000004s)]
*  So not good news for the ukrainians [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2929.5400000000004s)]
*  In response to that, I think that's fundamentally the condition on the ground that's created the next set of actions [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2932.34s)]
*  Which is the biden administration finally approved the use [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2937.1400000000003s)]
*  Of long-range missiles attackms missiles storm shadows to hit territory deep inside of russia the russians [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2941.06s)]
*  Believe and I don't know whether this is true or not. But what they say is that those weapons cannot be operated [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2948.42s)]
*  without [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2953.62s)]
*  americans or british [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2955.2200000000003s)]
*  Operators being there to you know, they're too complicated for the ukrainians just to use on their own [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2957.6s)]
*  so they the russians view this as not just a direct attack on their [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2962.42s)]
*  Homeland on their motherland, but also a direct involvement by [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2967.86s)]
*  the nato allies united states and [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2973.38s)]
*  britain in the war and that is a big escalation [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2976.26s)]
*  You know a lot of people say that [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2980.1000000000004s)]
*  The russians have all these red lines we keep crossing and they don't do anything. That's not true [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2982.42s)]
*  If you actually listen to what the russians have said there's only been two red lines [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2986.1800000000003s)]
*  the first red line was they said they would not accept nato expanding to ukraine and [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2990.5s)]
*  They proved their [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2996.18s)]
*  seriousness on that issue by invading ukraine [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=2997.54s)]
*  In february of 2022 the second red line is they said that they would not accept [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3000.8199999999997s)]
*  american long-range missiles being used to target inside of russia and that line has now been crossed so this leads us to [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3006.0s)]
*  the next set of events which is [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3013.94s)]
*  russia just used [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3016.66s)]
*  What may be some people are saying it's an icbm, but it probably is more likely to be [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3018.5s)]
*  Not an intercontinental but an intermediate range ballistic missile that hit a [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3024.02s)]
*  ukrainian city and it's obviously it didn't carry a nuclear payload, but it's the type of of ballistic missile that is used [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3031.2999999999997s)]
*  to carry [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3038.5s)]
*  Nuclear weapons there are a couple of features of this that I think are really important number one [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3039.7s)]
*  It's a hypersonic missile it hit the target at something like mock 10 [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3044.58s)]
*  What that means is that it just can't be intercepted. It's too fast out of the the west [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3048.66s)]
*  And the united states in particular does not as far as we know have a technology to intercept a hypersonic missile like that [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3053.22s)]
*  The second is that it had what's called a merv? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3059.62s)]
*  Warhead or payload merv is multiple [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3063.4599999999996s)]
*  independently targeted [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3067.2s)]
*  Reentry vehicles basically what it means is the warhead [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3069.06s)]
*  Splits up right when it gets close to the ground it splits into six separate [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3071.9399999999996s)]
*  Warheads and the reason for this as I understand it is diabolical again [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3076.48s)]
*  It's just if you're launching a nuclear weapon [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3080.26s)]
*  It just makes it that much harder to now intercept it because now you've got six warheads hitting you instead of just one [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3083.3s)]
*  so, I mean [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3090.0200000000004s)]
*  As I understand a missile like this has never been used before and what the russians are doing obviously [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3092.1000000000004s)]
*  Is sending us a signal and what that message is [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3096.82s)]
*  Is that they're saying we have the means to hit any european city or any european asset? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3099.94s)]
*  With a hypersonic missile that you can't stop that may or may not have a nuclear warhead attached to it [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3107.54s)]
*  and it's just a way of them expressing their seriousness and displeasure and and and reacting to and escalating in response to [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3115.9399999999996s)]
*  The fact that we are now allowing [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3123.4599999999996s)]
*  Western missiles to be hitting targets deep inside of russia [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3125.9399999999996s)]
*  So the bottom line is this war is escalating. It's escalating nowhere good and at some point soon [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3129.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's really we're gonna have to get off of this escalatory [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3135.06s)]
*  ladder or we're gonna end up in a really disastrous place and just the last final point is [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3139.14s)]
*  It's absolutely remarkable that biden decided to take us to this place [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3145.14s)]
*  With what just six weeks left in his term completely. I mean as a lame duck president [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3150.58s)]
*  What is his mandate for doing that for taking this extraordinary? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3154.8199999999997s)]
*  risk [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3158.2599999999998s)]
*  On behalf of the country the voters just voted for trump who made it really clear [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3159.14s)]
*  He wanted to end the war and biden and his team have unilaterally now escalated this war [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3163.54s)]
*  They did it without consulting with trump's team. At least that's what was publicly reported is there was no briefing set up for trump's transition team [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3168.7400000000002s)]
*  So you have here biden his team taking a unilateral action to expand and escalate this war even when he's a lame duck president [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3177.06s)]
*  And the question you have to ask is why what is the point of this? Well, I think it's just completely deranged [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3184.26s)]
*  Because it's not just that forget biden and trump for a second if you take a step back [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3189.7s)]
*  What was voted in? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3196.18s)]
*  Was to end this war and for the united states to get our hands out of it [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3198.4199999999996s)]
*  So you couldn't have a clearer message to the sitting president in the white house, which is this is not what americans want [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3204.74s)]
*  And so to basically ignore the will of the voters and to essentially go and push [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3211.8599999999997s)]
*  Another country into the brink I think is so incredibly responsible and you know other times we've said in the past [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3217.3s)]
*  Take donald trump [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3224.26s)]
*  Seriously, but not literally [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3226.32s)]
*  Russia you should take seriously and literally [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3228.7400000000002s)]
*  Because they actually write it down for you and tell you and so when they said [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3232.82s)]
*  Every act of aggression from now on is going to be [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3237.7000000000003s)]
*  Viewed by us on a look-through basis to the actual country that is enabling this to happen [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3240.5800000000004s)]
*  You couldn't be more clear, but americans couldn't have been more clear, which is we don't want this war anymore [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3246.18s)]
*  And I just think it's really deranged what the biden white house is doing. It's incredibly dangerous [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3252.5s)]
*  And by the way, not to mention it's incredibly costly as well [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3257.54s)]
*  I mean we've had like some last-minute efforts to sort of tamp down on these last-minute budget approvals and whatnot [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3260.02s)]
*  But we're talking about tens and hundreds of billions of dollars that we're giving on top of the risk of [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3265.8599999999997s)]
*  Of nuclear escalation. I just think it's absolutely crazy. It's absolutely crazy [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3270.66s)]
*  Putin is not a dummy [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3275.62s)]
*  He has heard and seen [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3277.7799999999997s)]
*  trump's [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3280.5s)]
*  campaign rhetoric [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3281.6s)]
*  and [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3283.7s)]
*  sacks, I don't know if this is this has been publicly reported that he had a call with with trump [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3284.98s)]
*  after the uh the election victory [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3290.74s)]
*  Does putin not see that in a couple of weeks a couple of months? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3293.46s)]
*  There will be new leadership in the white house and there's going to be a path to a resolution here [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3297.62s)]
*  As we look at it, we'll see the issue of nuclear [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3302.2599999999998s)]
*  Escalation because everyone's waiting for january 20th [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3306.66s)]
*  Oh, I mean for sure [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3310.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, thank goodness [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3311.22s)]
*  I would say that we have a new president coming in who does not own this war [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3312.42s)]
*  I mean the problem with biden is that he completely owns this war and he does not want to admit defeat [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3316.02s)]
*  And so what you've seen is that over the last couple of years every weapon system that biden said he wouldn't give [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3321.94s)]
*  to Ukraine because it could literally cause World War III. These are Biden's words. He said it could [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3328.1s)]
*  be Armageddon if we gave Ukraine F-16s, it could be Armageddon if we gave them Abrams tanks, it [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3332.3399999999997s)]
*  would be Armageddon if we gave them High Mars and Atacams and could lead to World War III if we let [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3337.86s)]
*  them hit targets inside of Russia. These are Biden's words. And he has basically given in on [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3343.94s)]
*  every single one of those points because he's so committed to this policy, right? He's in the [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3349.22s)]
*  quagmire. He can only double down. He doesn't know how to extricate himself. And now we don't know [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3354.02s)]
*  exactly what Kamala Harris would have done, but I think probably she would have inherited Joe Biden's [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3359.14s)]
*  policy and likely continued it. And I think we have a wonderful opportunity here with Trump taking [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3363.06s)]
*  office. He doesn't own this policy. He can look at it with fresh eyes. And most importantly, he [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3368.1s)]
*  campaigned on ending the war. So he has the mandate of the American people to stop it. All I can say [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3373.3s)]
*  is thank goodness. And we just need to get through the next two months. We need to get to January [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3379.38s)]
*  20th without there being some new horrible escalation in this war. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3383.78s)]
*  Joe Biden is martingaling. That's his strategy for the Ukraine-Russia war. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3392.1800000000003s)]
*  Just keep doubling down and doubling down. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3397.0600000000004s)]
*  Doubling down. Oh yeah. Do you want to explain what that is? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3398.82s)]
*  Oh yeah. Sorry. Martingaling is a strategy in gambling where let's just say you start [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3401.2200000000003s)]
*  betting a dollar and you lose. Your next bet is $2. If you lose, your next bet is $4. If you lose, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3406.02s)]
*  your next bet is $8. And eventually you'll win once is the theory. But there's many times [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3411.46s)]
*  where martingaling does not work. But you only win a dollar. So you could be betting, you know, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3417.54s)]
*  $40, $80, $160, $320. And then you finally win and you win a dollar. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3425.06s)]
*  Right. Or you go broke. That's a great analogy because you can also go broke, right? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3430.66s)]
*  You can easily go broke. Well, this is why they have caps at the roulette table. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3434.98s)]
*  One time I would do this as a joke. That's why all casinos have a max. Yeah. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3438.66s)]
*  So I would do this as a joke with my wife or when I was at the World Series of Poker. I'd be like, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3442.26s)]
*  I'm going to pay for dinner or lunch or whatever. And I put a hundred dollars on black, lose, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3445.86s)]
*  put 200 on black, win, go pay for lunch. And I did it one time at the WSOP and I won 100, 200, 400, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3450.58s)]
*  800, 1600. I ran out of cash. I got 3,200 from my friend. I put it down. The floor man came over and [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3458.34s)]
*  said, that's your last bet. Oh no, my buddy and I, my buddy and I would go play. If you do this. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3464.66s)]
*  Yeah. In our college years, early twenties, we would go to drink for free at the casino. You [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3470.66s)]
*  just sit at the blackjack table and just keep getting a dollar in black. Yeah, I've been with [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3475.46s)]
*  you at that blackjack table and watched you drink. This was a long time ago. This happened last year. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3477.22s)]
*  So I would, well, I mean, if you bet a dollar and then you bet two bucks, you can just keep drinking [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3482.2599999999998s)]
*  for free for like two or three hours and then go out and enjoy your night. You've made 15 bucks [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3486.1s)]
*  and call it enough. Did I tell you about the losing a million dollars playing roulette? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3490.18s)]
*  No. Me, Nick, you got to beep up the names. Me. It was me. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3495.14s)]
*  And you did tell me this. You did tell me this. Yeah. This is so good. He says, guys, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3502.8999999999996s)]
*  I've developed a system. It's full. That's always what happens before you lose a million. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3507.06s)]
*  And he says, it's like, we need to risk a million. We can win like two or three. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3512.98s)]
*  And it's like 99.996%. So I say to him, so are you really telling me that we just have to fade [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3518.02s)]
*  0.004% chance of like total loss? And he says, yep. Well, guess what hit the 0.004% shot? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3524.5s)]
*  Me. And it was devastating. I just kept looking at this thing. Like what just happened? He's like, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3534.4199999999996s)]
*  we lost. Yeah. And I was like, there it is folks. I never lost. I never lost. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3540.8999999999996s)]
*  And I was like, there it is folks. I never again, I've never going to play roulette again. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3545.54s)]
*  I think the gambling analogies are the right analogies. Because I look, I'm not saying World [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3549.46s)]
*  War III is going to happen. I've never said World War III is going to happen. I'm saying that there's [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3553.54s)]
*  a risk of World War III. And I don't need the risk to be very high to be very worried about it, [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3556.58s)]
*  because it would be such a disaster. Right. Totally. Exactly. So I want to minimize. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3560.66s)]
*  Exactly. I want there to be hopefully a zero risk of that. But you know, what's interesting is [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3568.18s)]
*  remember just like a week or two ago, President Trump made that trip to DC and he met with Biden [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3572.34s)]
*  in the Oval Office and Biden had this. He was like all smiles. And everyone's like wondering, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3577.46s)]
*  why is he so happy? And the speculation was that he somehow wanted a common to lose or something. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3584.26s)]
*  But now you think back on this, he must have known he was about to authorize this decision. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3590.9s)]
*  So what he's doing here, he's grin. He's grin. Trump, he knows he's about to give Trump [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3596.58s)]
*  this horrible hand, right? He's about to make this situation in Ukraine so much worse. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3603.06s)]
*  So that Trump will have to inherit this mess. That is like the definition of grin. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3608.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, he definitely knew more than that picture let on because a lot of the interpretation of that [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3614.3399999999997s)]
*  picture was they are getting along. He's being super gracious. What an incredible gesture. It [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3619.06s)]
*  just looked like very... Yeah, he promised a smooth transition of power. And then we find out that he [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3625.3s)]
*  didn't confer with his successor about this extraordinarily meaningful decision to escalate [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3630.1000000000004s)]
*  the war. It's like, that's just crazy. It's crazy. You guys want to do Science Corner? I got one for [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3638.34s)]
*  you. Yeah, let her in. All right. Your super fans are desperate for a Science Corner. Give [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3646.26s)]
*  them one, Freeboar. Give them something. All right. I will give you guys something. Here's [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3651.7s)]
*  a depressing paper that was published in the journal Nature just this week. Research team [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3656.74s)]
*  out of Switzerland going over to the Swiss where they are conducting extraordinary research [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3663.62s)]
*  in the epigenetics of fat cells in obesity. Oh, so we're going to fat shame me on the [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3670.02s)]
*  Science Corner. Go ahead. Great. No, we're actually going to understand perhaps why it is difficult [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3675.8599999999997s)]
*  for people that have been overweight to keep the weight off. I did read this and I think it's [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3681.14s)]
*  fascinating. Yeah. Explain it. It is really incredible. So remember, we've talked about this [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3687.3799999999997s)]
*  many times in the past, but every cell has all your DNA, all your genes. And certain genes are [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3691.54s)]
*  turned on or off in different cells. And those genes being on or off differentiates those cells [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3698.3399999999997s)]
*  and causes them to act differently. That's the difference between an eye cell and a skin cell [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3704.1s)]
*  and a heart cell is they have different genes that are upregulated, downregulated, turned on [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3709.22s)]
*  and turned off. And even when you have different kinds of cells, you have certain genes that are [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3712.74s)]
*  overexpressed or under expressed or overregulated or upregulated or downregulated. So that means that [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3716.98s)]
*  those genes are pumping out certain proteins that do certain things in that particular cell. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3721.4599999999996s)]
*  So what these folks did is they wanted to understand what is the epigenome, meaning what are [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3727.7s)]
*  the genes that are turned on or off or upregulated or downregulated in fat tissue and fat cells. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3733.7s)]
*  And does the epigenome change when an individual loses weight? So once they're obese [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3742.3399999999997s)]
*  and they lose weight, do the fat cells actually change their epigenome or do they have an [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3750.58s)]
*  epigenetic memory? Meaning that those cells, even though the person has lost weight, those cells [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3756.1s)]
*  still continue to act as if that person were obese. So I'll tell you in humans, they basically took [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3761.62s)]
*  five individuals that were obese and lost more than 25% BMI. And they looked at the epigenome, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3767.14s)]
*  they looked at the markers of what genes are upregulated and downregulated before and after [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3774.02s)]
*  they lost the weight. After they lost the weight, there were a set of markers that were still [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3778.18s)]
*  upregulated that are associated with poor metabolism and increased fibrosis and increased cellular [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3782.82s)]
*  death. So these are inflammatory genes. These are genes that are associated with the cells being [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3790.02s)]
*  inefficient, that utilizing glucose to create energy. And so these cells continue to act like [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3794.42s)]
*  slow dying cells, even after the person lost weight. And they did the same thing in mice, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3800.58s)]
*  and they found similar results that they caused these mice to gain weight, looked at the epigenome [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3805.94s)]
*  of the fat cells, and then looked at the epigenome after they lost the weight. And again, the mouse [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3811.62s)]
*  epigenome continued to act as if the mouse was obese. And what this means is that the metabolism [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3817.3s)]
*  remained reduced, fibrosis remained elevated, and likelihood of cell death remained elevated. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3823.2200000000003s)]
*  So now they applied glucose in a petri dish to those cells, and they saw that the glucose had a [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3828.6600000000003s)]
*  harder time being appropriately utilized from a healthy fat cell that hadn't been obese. So it [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3834.1800000000003s)]
*  actually permanently alters and creates an epigenetic memory in the fat cells after obesity. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3841.7s)]
*  And this could explain pretty significantly why when people that have been obese lose the weight, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3847.9399999999996s)]
*  they are more likely to gain the weight back and have a hard time keeping the weight off. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3854.1s)]
*  You're referring to yes. And that makes total sense because anybody who's added weight, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3858.18s)]
*  Chamath, if you add but, you know, you eat one extra Oreo a week, that's 3,500 calories. You do [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3863.14s)]
*  that over 20 years, all of a sudden you wake up one day, you're 20, 30 pounds overweight, like I [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3870.66s)]
*  almost three or four years ago. And this is why I think Ozempic and Wigovian, Mon giorno and all [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3874.3399999999997s)]
*  these things are so great because it does seem like it breaks you through that, no? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3878.42s)]
*  Well, the problem, what we do see in all those results that when you go off of the GLP-1 agonist [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3883.06s)]
*  drugs, you gain the weight back very quickly. This is some amount of weight. Yeah, it's not a total [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3888.2599999999998s)]
*  amount. It's a pretty significant bounce back effect. And this is pretty well documented. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3894.3399999999997s)]
*  And so I think that it speaks to the why. Now, it also introduces an opportunity. There are [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3899.94s)]
*  molecules that can turn certain genes on or off, can now be identified and utilized to change that [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3905.46s)]
*  epigenetic memory. So now there's a- So you can flip that switch in addition to speaking Wigovian. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3911.3s)]
*  Flip that switch. Exactly. This could arise from things like increased exercise. It turns out that [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3914.5s)]
*  when you do significant amounts of cardiovascular exercise, there are certain genes that are [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3920.1s)]
*  expressed that trigger other genes to switch on or off. And so we can start to identify those [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3924.5s)]
*  particular molecules and produce either supplements or additional drugs or combo therapies that can [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3929.54s)]
*  both knock the weight off and keep it off by changing the epigenetic memory in those cells. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3938.26s)]
*  Wow. And so it introduces a whole new class of opportunity for folks to explore how do we help [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3943.3s)]
*  folks that are obese lose the weight and then flip the switch that they can keep the weight off? [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3948.9s)]
*  I've been doing rocking. This is like the old man activity that Peter Attia and these guys are [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3952.74s)]
*  all talking about. You put weights on and you like go walking. I started with a 10 pound weight vest. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3958.2599999999998s)]
*  Now I'm at 35 pounds. I do a mile and a half hike every day with 35 pounds on. Man, I fall asleep [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3962.8199999999997s)]
*  immediately. And the amount of intensity that puts on your body- So you do it right before you go to [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3969.2999999999997s)]
*  bed? No, no. I do it anytime during the day. But I'm just saying, I'm focused on four things right [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3974.74s)]
*  now with my health, diet, sleep, exercise, meditation. And I try to do all four each day, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3980.1s)]
*  but the rocking specifically in the zone two stuff is what they say 40, 50 year olds should focus on. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3986.3399999999997s)]
*  So that's what I'm focused on. But that rocking, man, does it make your whole body strong? How [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3992.2599999999998s)]
*  they recommend it. It's really transformative. My meditation is reading doges for Chamath Pali [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=3997.14s)]
*  Hapitiya, chairman dictator, 80, 90. He's running a software company, services company. Great. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4003.14s)]
*  Look at you in the driver's seat. David Friedberg, your Sultan of science, working on a hollow and [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4009.38s)]
*  the architect, the rain man. Yeah, definitely. David Sack from craft ventures. And maybe he's [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4016.5s)]
*  going to be involved in Doge. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a Sacks Doge hook up in the [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4023.54s)]
*  future. I don't know. I'm taking a guess here. I am your host here, Jason Calacanis. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4028.5s)]
*  See you all on December 7th, live or in person. By the way, did you guys see this spectacular? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4034.02s)]
*  Did you see this tweet from Brian Johnson? He tweeted out all of his blood levels. This is [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4040.42s)]
*  incredible. I love this guy. Look at these results are incredible. If he can break this down into [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4045.86s)]
*  like a turnkey thing that normal folks like us can follow. For people who don't know what this kid's [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4052.02s)]
*  doing is he is spending like $3 million a year or something to that effect on his own personal health, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4061.06s)]
*  documenting it, sharing it. Everything from sleep to his bone density. Everything is an open book [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4067.86s)]
*  and he's made some products out of it as well. So you can, you can eat his pudding too, if you're [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4074.5s)]
*  interested in it, but I don't think it's as good as, how do you follow his regimen? You know what [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4079.22s)]
*  I mean? Like it just seems too hard. You can't have a job. I mean, he's doing, it's like, he's [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4083.06s)]
*  got two jobs right now doing all this stuff. His biomarkers are showing he's 10 years younger than [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4086.74s)]
*  his actual biological age. Dude, look at some of these results. His, his speed of aging. He says [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4090.9799999999996s)]
*  his birthday now happens every 19 months. What the F? Freeberg. I mean, Freeberg, you look at [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4097.54s)]
*  what do you think here? Science from a science perspective, any thoughts on all this? Well, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4107.86s)]
*  I think his nighttime erection rate is pretty impressive. Not three hours and eight minutes [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4112.58s)]
*  for a nighttime erection. Hold on. How does he know that? Is he reading, is he reading Elon [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4116.74s)]
*  and Vivek's op-ed column? Slowly. He's reading it very slowly. Wow. He's got a 240 pound bench press [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4120.98s)]
*  and an 800 pound leg press. Jesus. He looks like he's dead though. That's the only problem with this. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4130.66s)]
*  That is so bad. Sax has got to go. DJT online too. We'll see you all next time. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4137.06s)]

*  We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orgy because they're all just useless. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnmDeIgW3EQ&t=4178.900000000001s)]
